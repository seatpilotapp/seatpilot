@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Foreword  
How often have you heard these questions when discussing building codes\: “What is the intent  
of this section?” or,  
“How do I apply this provision?” This publication offers the code user a  
resource that addresses much of the intent and application principles of the major provisions of  
the 2021 International Building Code® \(IBC®\).  
It is impossible for building codes and similar regulatory documents to contain enough  
information, both prescriptive and explanatory narrative, to remove all doubt as to the intent of  
the various provisions. If such a document were possible, it would be so voluminous that it  
would be virtually useless.  
Because the IBC must be reasonably brief and concise in its provisions, the user must have  
knowledge of the intent and background of these provisions to apply them appropriately. The  
IBC places great reliance on the judgment of the building official and design professional for the  
specific application of its provisions. Where the designer and official have knowledge of the  
rationale behind the provisions, the design of the building and enforcement of the code will be  
based on informed judgment rather than arbitrariness or rote procedure.  
The information that this handbook provides, coupled with the design professional’s and  
building official’s experience and education, will result in better use of the IBC and more  
uniformity in its application. As lengthy as this document may seem, it still cannot provide all of  
the answers to questions of code intent; that is why the background, training, and experience of  
the reader must also be called on to properly apply, interpret, and enforce the code provisions.  
The preparation of a document of this nature requires consulting a large number of  
publications, organizations, and individuals. Even so, the intent of many code provisions is not  
completely documented. Sometimes the discussion is subjective; therefore, individuals may  
disagree with the conclusions presented. It is, however, important to note that the explanatory  
narratives are based on many decades of experience by the authors and the other contributors to  
the manuscript.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Preface  
Internationally, code officials and design professionals recognize the need for a modern, up-to-  
date building code addressing the design and installation of building systems through  
requirements emphasizing performance. The International Building Code® \(IBC®\) meets this  
need by providing model code regulations that safeguard the public health and safety in all  
communities, large and small. The 2021 IBC Illustrated Handbook is a valuable resource for  
those who design, plan, review, inspect, or construct buildings or other structures regulated by  
the 2021 IBC.  
The IBC is one of a family of codes published by the International Code Council® \(ICC®\) that  
establishes comprehensive minimum regulations for building systems using prescriptive and  
performance-related provisions. It is founded on broad-based principles that use new materials  
and new building designs. Additionally, the IBC is compatible with the entire family of  
International Codes® published by the ICC.  
There are three major subdivisions to the IBC\:  
1\. The text of the IBC  
2\. The referenced standards listed in Chapter 35  
3\. The appendices  
The first 34 chapters of the IBC contain both prescriptive and performance provisions that are  
to be applied. Chapter 35 contains those referenced standards that, although promulgated and  
published by separate organizations, are considered part of the IBC as applicable. The provisions  
of the appendices do not apply unless specifically included in the adoption ordinance of the  
jurisdiction enforcing the code.  
The 2021 IBC Illustrated Handbook is designed to present commentary only for those  
portions of the code for which commentary is helpful in furthering the understanding of the  
provision and its intent. This handbook uses many drawings and figures to help clarify the  
application and intent of many code provisions.  
The handbook examines the intent and application of many provisions for both the  
nonstructural- and structural-related aspects of the IBC. It addresses in detail many requirements  
that are considered as “fire- and life-safety” provisions of the code. Found in IBC Chapters 3  
through 10, these provisions focus on the important considerations of occupancy and type of  
construction classification, allowable building size, fire and smoke protection features, fire  
protection systems, interior finishes, and means of egress.  
The discussion of the structural provisions in this handbook is intended to help code users  
understand and properly apply the requirements in Chapters 16 through 23 of the 2021 IBC.  
Although useful to a broad range of individuals, the discussion of the structural provisions was  
written primarily so that building officials, plans reviewers, architects, and engineers can get a  
general understanding of the IBC’s structural requirements and gain some insight into their  
underlying basis and intent. To that end, the numerous figures, tables, and examples are intended  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationto illustrate and help clarify the proper application of many structural provisions of the IBC.  
Because the IBC adopts many national standards by reference rather than transcribing the  
structural provisions of the standards into the code itself, in some cases the discussion in this  
handbook pertains to the provisions found in a referenced standard such as ASCE 7 or ACI 318  
rather than the IBC. The structural provisions addressed focus on the general design  
requirements related to structural load effects; special inspection and verification, structural  
testing, and structural observation; foundations and soils; and specific structural materials design  
requirements for concrete, masonry, steel, and wood.  
Questions or comments concerning this handbook are encouraged. Please direct any  
correspondence to handbook@iccsafe.org.  
Participation in ICC Code Development Process. Architects, engineers, designers, builders,  
and other professionals can freely participate in the ICC Code Development Process by  
submitting proposed code changes, collaborating with colleagues in developing code language  
and submitting changes, participating in giving testimony, and becoming ICC members to have  
voting opportunities in person or online at Committee Action Hearings. The Code Development  
Process is conducted via the ICC’s state-of-the-art, cloud-based cdpACCESS system. Committee  
Action Hearings and Public Comment Hearings are broadcast live so anyone can follow the  
testimonies and actions taken. All building design and construction professionals are encouraged  
to participate in the ICC Code Development Process and have a say in the outcome of future  
editions of the International Building Code or any other of the ICC International Codes. Because  
architects, engineers, and other design and construction professionals apply the code to actual  
buildings and experience first-hand the effectiveness of code provisions, it is very critical for  
them to participate in the Code Development Process and improve the code each cycle.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Acknowledgments  
The publication of this handbook is based on many decades of experience by the authors and the  
other contributors. Since its initial publication, the handbook has become a living document  
subject to changes and refinements as newer code regulations are released. This latest edition  
reflects extensive modifications based on the requirements found in the 2021 International  
Building Code® \(IBC®\).  
The initial handbook, on which the nonstructural portions of this document are based, was  
published in 1988. It was authored by Vincent R. Bush. In developing the discussions of intent,  
Mr. Bush drew heavily on his 25 years of experience in building safety regulation. Mr. Bush, a  
structural engineer, was intimately involved in code development work for many years.  
In addition to the expertise of Mr. Bush, major contributions were made by John F. Behrens.  
Mr. Behrens’s qualifications were as impressive as the original author’s. He had vast experience  
as a building official, code consultant, and seminar instructor. Mr. Behrens provided the original  
manuscript of the means of egress chapter and assisted in the preparation of many other chapters.  
Revisions to the handbook occurred regularly over the years, with nonstructural content based  
on the provisions of the International Building Code authored by Doug Thornburg, AIA, CBO.  
Mr. Thornburg, a certified building official and registered architect, has over 40 years of  
experience in the building regulatory profession. Previously a building inspector, plans reviewer,  
building code administrator, seminar instructor, and code consultant, he is currently the Vice  
President and Technical Director of Products and Services at the International Code Council®  
\(ICC®\). In his present role, Mr. Thornburg develops and reviews technical publications,  
reference books, resource materials, and educational programs relating to the International  
Codes®  
. He continues to present building code seminars nationally and has developed numerous  
educational texts, including Significant Changes to the IBC, 2021 Edition. Mr. Thornburg was  
presented with the ICC’s inaugural Educator of the Year Award in 2008, recognizing his  
outstanding contributions in education and training.  
The basis of the discussion on the structural provisions in the 2021 IBC Illustrated Handbook  
is the 2000 IBC Handbook—Structural Provisions, authored by S. K. Ghosh, Ph.D., and Robert  
Chittenden, SE. Dr. Ghosh initially authored Chapters 16 and 19, and Mr. Chittenden authored  
Chapters 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, and 23. John Henry, PE, former ICC principal staff engineer, then  
authored the commentary addressing IBC Chapters 16 through 23 for several editions. Mr. Henry  
was presented with the ICC’s John Nosse Award for Technical Excellence in 2011, recognizing  
his outstanding contributions and technical expertise. William Bracken, PE, a registered civil and  
structural engineer with over 30 years of related experience, authored a portion of the  
commentary in the 2018 edition.  
The structural provisions in relation to Chapters 16 through 23 in this edition have been  
updated by Chris Kimball, SE. Mr. Kimball is a licensed structural engineer, civil engineer, and  
ICC master code professional. He is also certified by the ICC in many other disciplines,  
including building official and fire code official. Mr. Kimball earned a master’s degree with an  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationemphasis in structural engineering and currently serves as the Vice President of West Coast Code  
Consultants, Inc. \(WC³\), a third-party plan review and inspection company. He has performed  
plan reviews for thousands of complex projects throughout the United States, is an ICC-approved  
instructor, and has authored several publications, including the 2018 International Existing  
Building Code Handbook. Mr. Kimball has provided code training classes to building official,  
design professional, and contractor organizations throughout the United States.  
Great appreciation is due a number of individuals who contributed their vast expertise and  
experience to the development of this publication. Special recognition goes to Sandra Hyde, PE,  
ICC Senior Staff Engineer; Jay Woodward, ICC Senior Staff Architect; Buddy Showalter, PE,  
ICC Senior Staff Engineer; and Kevin Scott, President of KH Scott and Associates, for their  
valued review and input.  
The information and opinions expressed in this handbook are those of the present and past  
authors, as well as the many contributors, and do not necessarily represent the official position of  
the International Code Council. Additionally, the opinions may not represent the viewpoint of  
any enforcing agency. Opinions expressed in this handbook are only intended to be a resource in  
the application of the IBC, and the building official is not obligated to accept such opinions. The  
building official is the final authority in rendering interpretations of the code.

Key Points  
In addition to the code’s scope, this chapter covers general subjects such as the purpose of the  
code, the duties and powers of the building official, performance provisions relating to  
alternative methods and materials of construction, applicability of the provisions, and creation  
of the code compliance agency. This chapter also contains requirements for the issuance of  
permits, subsequent inspections, and certificates of occupancy. The provisions in this chapter  
are of such a general nature as to apply to the entire International Building Code® \(IBC®\).  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 101 Scope and General Requirements  
101.2 Scope. The scope of the code as outlined in this section is that the IBC applies to virtually  
anything that is built or constructed. The definitions of “Building” and “Structure” in Chapter 2  
are so inclusive that the code intends that any work of any kind that is accomplished on any  
building or structure comes within its scope. Thus, the code would apply to a major high-rise  
office building as well as to a retaining wall creating a significant elevation change on a building  
site. However, certain types of work are exempt from the permit process as indicated in the  
discussion of required permits in this chapter.  
Whereas initially the IBC appears to address all construction-related activities, the design and  
construction of most detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses, as well as their  
accompanying accessory structures, are intended to be regulated under the International  
Residential Code® \(IRC®\). However, in order for such structures to fall under the authority of the  
IRC, two limiting factors have been established. First, each such building is limited to a  
maximum height of three stories above grade plane as established by the definition of “Story  
above grade plane” in Section 202. In broad terms, where a floor level is located predominantly  
above the adjoining exterior ground level, it would be considered in the total number of stories  
above grade plane for evaluation of its regulation by the IRC. It is quite possible that a residential  
unit with four floor levels will be regulated by the IRC, provided that the bottom floor level is  
established far enough below the exterior grade that it would not qualify as a story above grade  
plane, but rather as a basement. Additional occupiable floor levels may also be permitted under  
the allowances in the IRC for habitable attics and mezzanines. For further discussion on the  
determination of a story above grade plane as similarly regulated in the IBC, see the commentary  
on Section 202. Second, each dwelling unit of a two-family dwelling or townhouse must be  
provided with a separate means of egress. Although the definition of an IBC means of egress  
would require travel extending to the public way, for the purpose of this requirement it is  
acceptable to provide individual and isolated egress only until reaching the exterior of the  
dwelling at grade level. Once reaching the exterior at grade, the building occupants could  
conceivably share a stairway, sidewalk, or similar pathway to the public way. The IRC does not  
regulate egress beyond the structure itself; thus, any exit discharge conditions would only be  
applicable to IBC structures.  
Townhouse design and construction is also regulated by the IRC. Section 202 defines a  
townhouse as a dwelling unit that is part of a grouping of three or more single-family dwelling  
units in the same structure. The units must each extend individually from the ground to the sky,  
with open space provided on at least two sides of each dwelling unit. The effect of such  
limitations maintains the concept of “multiple single-family dwellings.  
”  
The requirement for open space on a minimum of two sides of each townhouse unit allows for  
interpretation regarding the degree of openness. Although not specific in language, the provision  
intends that each townhouse be provided with a moderate degree of exterior wall, thus allowing  
for adequate fire department access to each individual unit. A townhouse condition occurs where  
the four established criteria are met. The presence of a lot line or property line between attached  
dwelling units, or the lack of such a line, has no bearing on its designation as a townhouse.  
Structures such as garages, carports, and storage sheds are also regulated by the IRC where  
they are considered accessory to the residential buildings previously mentioned. Such accessory  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbuildings are limited in height under the same limitations applied to dwellings, a maximum of  
three stories above grade plane. The maximum floor areas of dwellings and accessory structures  
constructed under the IRC are unlimited; however, it is possible that local zoning ordinances will  
provide some degree of regulation.  
Even though the IRC may use the IBC as a reference for certain design procedures, the intent  
is to use only the IRC for the design and construction of one- and two-family dwellings, multiple  
single-family dwellings \(townhouses\), and their accessory structures. This does not preclude the  
use of the IBC by a design professional for the design of the types of residential buildings  
specified. However, unless specifically directed to the IBC by provisions of the IRC, it is not the  
intent of the IRC to utilize the IBC for provisions not specifically addressed. For example, the  
maximum allowable floor area of a residence based on the building’s type of construction is not  
addressed in the IRC. Therefore, there is no limit to the floor area permitted in the dwelling unit.  
It would not be appropriate to use the IBC to limit the residence’s floor area based on  
construction type.  
101.2.1 Appendices. A number of subjects are addressed in Appendices A through O. The topics  
range from detailed information on the creation of a board of appeals to more general provisions  
for grading, excavation, and earthwork. Although the code clearly indicates that the appendices  
are not considered a part of the IBC unless they are specifically adopted by the jurisdiction, this  
does not mean they are of any less worth than those set forth in the body of the code. Although  
there are several reasons why a set of code requirements is positioned in the Appendix, the most  
common reasons are that the provisions are limited to a small geographic location or are of  
interest to only a small number of jurisdictions.  
Jurisdictions have the ability to adopt any or all of the appendices based on their own needs.  
However, just because an appendix has not been adopted does not lessen its value as a resource.  
In making decisions of interpretation of the code, as well as in evaluating alternate materials and  
methods, the provisions of an appendix may serve as a valuable tool in making an appropriate  
decision. Even in those cases where a specific appendix is not in force, the information it  
contains may help in administering the IBC.  
101.3 Intent. Various factors are regulated that contribute to the performance of a building in  
regard to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The IBC identifies several of these major  
factors as those addressing structural strength, egress capabilities, sanitation and other  
environmental issues, fire- and life-safety concerns, energy conservation, fire/explosion hazards,  
and other dangerous conditions. In addition, the safety of fire fighters and emergency personnel  
responding to an emergency situation is an important consideration. The primary goal of the IBC  
is to address any and all hazards that are attributed to the presence and use of a jurisdiction’s  
buildings and structures, and to safeguard the public from such hazards.  
The intent of the code is more inclusive than most people realize. A careful reading will note  
that in addition to providing for life safety and safeguarding property, the code also intends that  
its provisions consider the general welfare of the public. This latter item, general welfare, is not  
so often thought of as being part of the purpose of a building code. However, in the case of the  
IBC, safeguarding the public’s general welfare is a part of its intent, which is accomplished, for  
example, by provisions that ameliorate the conditions found in substandard or dangerous  
buildings. Moreover, upon the adoption of a modern building code such as the IBC, the general  
level of building safety and quality is raised. This in turn contributes to the public welfare by  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationincreasing the tax base and livability. Additionally, substandard conditions are reduced, and the  
subsequent reduction of unsanitary conditions contributes to safeguarding the public welfare. For  
example, the maintenance provisions of the International Property Maintenance Code® \(IPMC®\)  
and the continued enforcement of the IBC slow the development of substandard conditions. A  
rigorous enforcement of the IPMC will actually reduce the conditions that contribute to the  
deterioration of the existing building stock. Thus, public welfare is enhanced by the increased  
benefits that inure to the general public of the jurisdiction as a result of the code provisions.  
The concept of “minimum” requirements is the established basis for the technical provisions  
set forth in the IBC. The requirements are intended to identify the appropriate level of regulation  
to achieve a balanced approach to the design and construction of buildings. On the one hand, it is  
critical that an appropriate degree of safety be established in order to protect the general public.  
Conversely, it is also important that the economic impact of the regulations be considered, as  
well as a building’s efficiency of use. It is this balance of concerns that provides for the  
necessary degree of public health, safety, and welfare within appropriate economic limits. The  
establishment of multiple occupancy classifications with varying requirements for each is a basic  
example of this philosophy.  
101.4 Referenced codes. A number of other codes are promulgated by the International Code  
Council® \(ICC®\) in order to provide a full set of coordinated construction codes. Seven of those  
companion codes are identified in this section, as they are specifically referenced in one or more  
provisions of the IBC. The adoption of the IBC does not automatically include the full adoption  
of the referenced codes, but rather only those portions specifically referenced by the IBC.  
For example, Section 903.3.5 requires that water supplies for automatic sprinkler systems be  
protected against backflow in accordance with the International Plumbing Code® \(IPC®\). As a  
result, when the IBC is adopted, so are the backflow provisions of the IPC. The extent of the  
reference is backflow protection; therefore, that is the only portion of the IPC that is applicable.  
Broader references are also provided, such as many of the references to the International Fire  
Code® \(IFC®\). Section 307.2 requires that hazardous materials in any quantity conform to the  
requirements of the IFC. Although the entire IFC may not be adopted by the jurisdiction, the  
provisions applicable to hazardous materials are in force with the adoption of the IBC.  
The International Existing Building Code® \(IEBC®\) is referenced in its entirety for any  
building undergoing a repair, alteration, addition, relocation, or change of occupancy.  
Section 102 Applicability  
102.1 General. Where there is a conflict between two or more provisions found in the code as  
they relate to differences of materials, methods of construction, or other requirements, the most  
restrictive provision will govern. Typically, the code will identify how the varying requirements  
should be applied. For example, the occupant load along with the appropriate factor from Section  
1005.3.1 is used to calculate the total capacity required for egress stairways—often referred to as  
the calculated width. Section 1011.2 also addresses the minimum required width for a stairway  
based on the absolute width necessary for use of a stairway under any condition, deemed to be  
the component width. When determining the proper minimum width required by the code, the  
more restrictive, or wider, stairway width would be used. See Application Example 102-1.  
In addition, where a conflict occurs between a specific requirement and a general requirement,  
the more specific provision shall apply. Again, the IBC provisions typically clarify the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationappropriate requirement that is to be applied without the need to determine the appropriate  
general/specific relationship. As an example, Section 1011.5.2 limits the height of stair risers to 7  
inches \(178 mm\) as a general requirement for stairways. However, Section 1030.14.2.2 allows  
for a maximum riser height of 8 inches \(203 mm\) for stepped aisles serving assembly seating  
areas. Because the greater riser height is only permitted for a specific stair condition, rather than  
for all stairways in general, it is intended to apply where those special means of egress provisions  
established in Section 1030 are applicable.  
Application Example 102-1  
Occasionally it is difficult, during the comparison of two different code provisions, to  
determine which is the general requirement and which is the specific requirement. In some cases,  
both requirements are specific, but one is more specific than the other. It is important that the  
intent of this section be applied in reviewing the proper application of the code. Where it can be  
determined that one provision is more specific in its scope than the other provision, the more  
specific requirement shall apply, regardless of whether it is more or less restrictive in application.  
102.4 Referenced codes and standards. Differences between the code and the various standards  
it references are to be expected. Unlike the companion International Codes® where consistency  
between them can be provided, there is not necessarily a conscious effort to see that the standard  
and code publications are completely compatible with each other. In fact, such compatibility  
would be impossible to achieve due to a variety of factors. As a result, it is critical that the code  
indicate that its provisions are to be applied over those of a referenced standard where such  
differences exist. For example, the provisions of National Fire Protection Association \(NFPA\)  
13R addressing sprinkler systems in residential occupancies allow for the omission of sprinklers  
at specified exterior locations, including decks and balconies. However, the provisions of IBC  
Section 903.3.1.2.1 mandate sprinkler protection for such areas where specific conditions exist.  
In this case, the provisions of the IBC for sprinkler protection would apply regardless of the  
allowances contained in NFPA 13R.  
There are also times when the standard being referenced includes subject matter that falls  
within the scope of the IBC or the other International Codes. It is intended that the requirements  
of a referenced standard supplement the IBC provisions in those areas not already addressed by  
the code. In those areas where parallel or conflicting requirements occur, the IBC provisions are  
always to be applied. For example, IBC Section 415.9.3 mandates that “the construction and  
installation of dry cleaning plants shall be in accordance with the requirements of the IBC, the  
International Mechanical Code, the International Plumbing Code, and NFPA 32.  
” Although  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationNFPA 32 addresses construction and installation criteria for dry cleaning plants, only those  
portions of the standard that are not addressed within the IBC, IMC, and IPC are applicable.  
Section 103 Code Compliance Agency  
This section recognizes the creation of a jurisdictional enforcement agency charged with  
implementing, administering, and enforcing the IBC. The term building official, as used in the  
IBC, represents the individual appointed by the jurisdiction to head the code compliance agency.  
Although many jurisdictions utilize the title Building Official to recognize the individual in  
charge of this agency, there are many other titles that are used. These include Chief Building  
Inspector, Superintendent of Central Inspection, Director of Code Enforcement, and various  
other designations. Regardless of the title selected for use by the individual jurisdiction, the IBC  
views all of these as equivalent to the term building official.  
The building official, in turn, appoints personnel as necessary to carry out the duties and  
responsibilities of the code compliance agency. Such staff members \(deputies\), including  
inspectors, plan examiners, and other employees, are empowered by the building official to carry  
out those functions set forth by the jurisdiction. Where the IBC references the building official in  
any capacity, the code reference also includes any deputies who have been granted enforcement  
authority by the building official. Where an inspector or plan reviewer makes a decision of  
interpretation, they are assuming the role of building official in arriving at that decision. There is  
an expectation on behalf of the jurisdiction that such employees possess the knowledge and  
experience to take on this responsibility. The failure to grant appropriate authority will often  
result in both ineffective and inefficient results.  
For those jurisdictions desiring guidelines within the text of the code for the selection of  
agency personnel, Appendix A addresses minimum employee qualifications for various  
positions. Experience and certification criteria for building officials, chief inspectors, inspectors,  
and plans examiners are set forth in this Appendix chapter.  
Section 104 Duties and Powers of Building Official  
104.1 General. The IBC is designed to regulate in both a prescriptive and performance manner.  
An extensive number of provisions have been intentionally established to allow for jurisdictional  
interpretation based on the specifics of the situation. This section establishes the building  
official’s authority to render such interpretations of the IBC. In addition, the building official  
may adopt policies and procedures that will help clarify the application of the code. Although  
having no authority to provide variances or waivers to the code requirements, the building  
official is charged with interpreting and clarifying the provisions found in the IBC, provided that  
such decisions are in conformance with the intent and purpose of the code.  
The authority to interpret the intended application of the IBC is a powerful tool available to  
the building official. With such authority comes a great degree of responsibility. Such  
interpretations must be consistent with the intent and purpose of the code. It is therefore  
necessary that all reasonable efforts be made to determine the code’s intent in order to develop  
an appropriate interpretation. Various sources should be consulted to provide a broad  
background from which to make a decision. These could include discussions with peers, as well  
as information found in various educational texts and technical guides. However, it must be  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstressed that the ultimate responsibility for determining the appropriateness of an interpretation  
lies with the jurisdictional building official, and all opinions from others, both verbal and written,  
are just that, opinions. The building official must never relinquish their authority to others in the  
administration of these very important interpretive powers. See also the discussion on alternative  
materials, design, and methods of construction in Section 104.11.  
104.4 Inspections. Those inspections required under the provisions found in Section 110 are to  
be performed by the building official or by authorized representatives of the building official. It  
is also acceptable that outside firms or individuals be utilized for inspections, provided such  
firms or individuals have been approved by the building official. This option may allow for  
better use of available resources. Written reports shall be provided for each inspection that is  
made.  
104.5 Identification. For the benefit of all individuals involved, inspection personnel of the code  
compliance agency are mandated to carry proper identification. The display of an identification  
card or badge, an example of which is shown in Figure 104-1, signifies the function and  
authority of the individual performing the inspection.  
Figure 104-1 Personnel identification badge.  
104.6 Right of entry. This section has been compatible with Supreme Court decisions since the  
1960s regarding acts of inspection personnel seeking entry into buildings for the purpose of  
making inspections. Under present case law, an inspection may not be made of a property,  
whether it be a private residence or a business establishment, without first having secured  
permission from the owner or person in charge of the premises. If entry is refused by the person  
having control of the property, the building official must obtain an inspection warrant from a  
court having jurisdiction in order to secure entry. The important feature of the law regarding  
right of entry is that entry must be made only by permission of the person having control of the  
property. Lacking this permission, entry may be gained only through the use of an inspection  
warrant.  
If entry is again refused after an inspection warrant has been obtained, the jurisdiction has  
recourse through the courts to remedy this situation. One avenue is to obtain a civil injunction in  
which the court directs the person having control of the property to allow inspection.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAlternatively, the jurisdiction can initiate proceedings in criminal court for punishment of the  
person having control of the property. It cannot be repeated too strongly that criminal court  
proceedings should never be initiated against an owner or other person having control of the  
property if an inspection warrant has not been obtained. Because the consequences of not  
following proper procedures can be so devastating to a jurisdiction if a suit is brought against it,  
the jurisdiction’s legal officer should always be consulted in these matters.  
104.8 Liability. It is the intent of the IBC that the building official not become personally liable  
for any damage that occurs to persons or property as a result of the building official’s acts so  
long as they act in good faith and without malice or fraud. This protection is also extended to any  
member of the Board of Appeals, as well as any jurisdictional employee charged with  
enforcement of the IBC. Nevertheless, legal action is occasionally undertaken in an effort to hold  
civil officers personally liable for their acts. This section requires that the jurisdiction defend the  
building official or other protected party if a suit is brought against them. Furthermore, the code  
requires any judgment resulting from a suit to be assumed by the jurisdiction.  
Case law regarding tort liability of building officials is constantly in a state of flux, and past  
doctrines may not now be applicable. Therefore, the legal officer of the jurisdiction should  
always be consulted when there is any question about liability.  
104.10 Modifications. The provisions of this section allow the building official to make  
modifications to the requirements of the code under certain specified circumstances. The  
building official may modify requirements if it is determined that strict application of the code is  
impractical and, furthermore, that the modification is in conformity with the intent and purpose  
of the code. Without this provision in the IBC, the building official has very little discretionary  
enforcement authority and, therefore, would have to enforce the specific wording in the code, no  
matter how unreasonable the application would be.  
The code does not intend to allow the building official to issue a variance to the provisions of  
the code to permit, for example, the use of only a single exit where two are required. This is  
clearly not in conformity with the intent and purpose of the code, no matter how difficult it may  
be to meet the requirements. In fact, the code is very specific that any modification cannot reduce  
health, accessibility, structural, and fire- and life-safety requirements.  
Where the building official grants a modification under this section, the details of such an  
action shall be recorded. This document must then be entered into the files of the code  
compliance agency. By providing a written record of the action taken and maintaining a copy of  
that action in the agency files, the building official always has access to the decision-making  
process and final determination of his or her action should there be a need to review the decision.  
Although it is expected that a permanent record be available for future reference when a  
modification is accepted, there is perhaps an even more important reason for the recording and  
filing of details of the approving action. The willingness to document and archive the  
modification action indicates the confidence of the building official in the decision that was  
made. A reluctance to maintain a record of the action taken typically indicates a lack of  
commitment to the action taken.  
104.11 Alternative materials, design, and methods of construction and equipment. This  
section of the IBC may be one of the most important. It allows for the adoption of new  
technologies in materials and building construction that currently are not covered by the code.  
Furthermore, it gives the code even more of a performance character. The IBC thus encourages  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstate-of-the-art concepts in design, construction, and materials as long as they meet the  
performance intended by the code. When evaluating the alternative methods under consideration,  
the building official must review for equivalency in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire  
resistance, durability, and safety. It is expected that all alternatives, once presented to the  
building official for review and approval, be thoroughly evaluated by the code compliance  
agency for compliance with this section. If such compliance can be established, the alternatives  
are deemed to be acceptable.  
The provisions of this section, similar to those of Sections 104.1 and 104.10, reference the  
intent of the code. It is mandated that the building official, when evaluating a proposed  
alternative to the code, only approve its use where it can be determined that it complies with the  
intent of the specific code requirements. Thus, it is the responsibility of the building official to  
utilize those resources necessary to understand the intended result of the code provisions. Only  
then can the code be properly applied and enforced.  
Similar to the approach taken where modifications are requested under the criteria of Section  
104.10, the request for acceptance under this section should be made in writing to the building  
official. At a minimum, the submittal should include\: \(1\) the specific code section and  
requirement, \(2\) an analysis of the perceived intent of the provision under review, \(3\) the special  
reasons as to why strict compliance with the code provision is not possible, \(4\) the proposed  
alternative, \(5\) an explanation of how the alternative meets or exceeds the intended level of  
compliance, and \(6\) a request for acceptance of the alternative material, design, or method of  
construction. Where approval of the request is not granted, it is mandated that the building  
official state in writing the reasons for denial. Such an action provides for a clear understanding  
as to why the alternative was not accepted, thereby providing guidance for future submittals.  
104.11.1 Research reports. Whereas the provisions of Section 104.11 grant the building official  
broad authority in accepting alternative materials, designs, and methods of construction, the  
process of evaluating such alternatives is often a difficult and complicated task. Valid research  
reports, including those termed evaluation reports, can address and delineate a review of the  
appropriate testing procedures to support the alternative as code compliant. The use of a research  
report may be helpful in reducing additional testing or documentation that is necessary to  
indicate compliance. It is important that the building official evaluate not only the information  
contained within the research report, but also the technical expertise of the individual or firm  
issuing the report. It must be noted, however, that a research report is simply a resource to the  
building official to assist in the decision-making process. The research report itself does not  
grant approval, as acceptance is still under the sole authority of the building official.  
One of the most commonly utilized research reports is the ICC Evaluation Service \(ICC-ES\)  
Evaluation Report. ICC-ES is a nonprofit, limited liability company that does technical  
evaluations of building products, components, methods, and materials. If it is found that the  
subject of an evaluation complies with code requirements, then ICC-ES publishes a report to that  
effect and makes the report available to the public. However, ICC-ES Evaluation Reports are  
only advisory. The authority having jurisdiction is always the final decision maker with respect  
to acceptance of the product, material, or method in question.  
104.11.2 Tests. The provisions of this section provide the building official with discretionary  
authority to require tests to substantiate proof of compliance with code requirements. The  
application of these provisions should be restricted to those cases where evidence of compliance  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationis either nonexistent or involves actions considered to be impractical. Certainly, when the use of  
an alternative material, design, or method of construction is requested under the provision of  
Section 104.11, test information can be quite beneficial to the building official. There may also  
be insufficient evidence of compliance that can be substantiated through alternative tests.  
An example would be the placement of concrete where the quality-control measures \(i.e.,  
cylinder tests\) did not prove to be complying with minimum strength requirements. Testing of  
core samples or perhaps use of nondestructive test methods might be appropriate to demonstrate  
compliance.  
The provisions also specify that the tests be those that are specifically enumerated within the  
adopted construction regulations or, as an alternative, be those of other recognized national test  
standards. Where test standards do not exist, the building official has the authority to determine  
the test procedures necessary to demonstrate compliance. In addition to determining appropriate  
test methods or procedures, the building official is mandated to maintain records of such tests in  
accordance with local or state statutes.  
Section 105 Permits  
This section covers those requirements related to the activities of the code compliance agency  
with respect to the issuance of permits. The issuance of permits, plan review, and inspection of  
construction for which permits have been issued constitute the bulk of the agency’s duties. It is  
for this reason that the code goes into detail regarding the permit-issuance process. Additionally,  
the code provides detailed requirements for the inspection process in order to help ensure that the  
construction for which the inspections are made complies with the code in all respects.  
105.1 Required. Prior to obtaining a permit, the owner of the property under consideration, or  
the owner’s authorized agent, must apply to the building official for any necessary permits that  
are required by the jurisdiction. One or more permits may be required to cover the various types  
of work being accomplished. In addition to building permits that address new construction,  
alterations, additions, repairs, moving of structures, demolition, or change in occupancy, trade  
permits are required to erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert, or replace any  
electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system. It is evident that almost any work, other than  
cosmetic changes, must be done under the authority of a permit.  
Typically, a permit is required each time a distinct activity occurs that is regulated under the  
code. However, certain alterations to previously approved systems can be performed under an  
annual permit authorized by the building official. Electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing  
installations are eligible for such consideration when one or more qualified trade persons are  
employed by the person, firm, or corporation who owns or operates the building, structure, or  
premises where the work is to take place. In addition, the qualified individuals must regularly be  
present at the building or site.  
105.2 Work exempt from permit. It would seem that the IBC should require permits for any  
type of work that is covered by the scope of the code. However, this section provides limited  
applications for exempted work. This section not only exempts certain types of building  
construction from permits, but also addresses electrical, gas, mechanical, and plumbing work that  
is of such a minor nature that permits are not necessary.  
It is further the intent of the IBC that even though work may be exempted from a permit, such  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwork done on a building or structure must still comply with the provisions of the code. As  
indicated in Section 101.2, the scope of the IBC is virtually all-inclusive. This may seem to be a  
superfluous requirement where a permit is not required. However, this type of provision is  
necessary to provide that the owner, as well as any design professional or contractor involved, be  
responsible for the proper and safe construction of all work being done.  
A common example of exempted work is a small, one-story detached accessory structure such  
as a storage shed. Although the code does not require a permit for an accessory building not  
exceeding 120 square feet \(11 m2\) in floor area, all provisions in the code related to a Group U  
occupancy must still be followed regardless of size.  
105.3 Application for permit. In this section, the IBC directs that a permit must be applied for,  
and describes the information required on the permit application. The permit-issuance process, as  
envisioned by the IBC, is intended to provide records within the code compliance agency of all  
construction activities that take place within the jurisdiction and to provide orderly controls of  
the construction process. Thus, the application for permit is intended to describe in detail the  
work to be done. In this section, the building official is directed to review the application for  
permit. This review is not a discretionary procedure, but is mandated by the code.  
The code also charges the building official with the issuance of the permit when it has been  
determined that the information filed with the application shows compliance with the IBC and  
other laws and ordinances applicable to the building at its location in the jurisdiction. The  
building official may not withhold the issuance of a permit if these conditions are met. As an  
example, the building official would be in violation in withholding the issuance of a building  
permit for a swimming pool because an adjacent cabana was previously constructed without a  
permit.  
105.4 Validity of permit. The code intends that the issuance of a permit should not be construed  
as permitting a violation of the code or any other law or ordinance applicable to the building. In  
fact, the IBC authorizes the building official to require corrections if there were errors in the  
approved plans or permit application at the time the permit was issued. The building official is  
further authorized to require corrections of the actual construction if it is in violation of the code,  
although in accordance with the plans. Moreover, the building official is further authorized to  
invalidate the permit if it is found that the permit was issued in error or in violation of any  
regulation or provision of the code.  
Although it may be poor public relations to invalidate a permit or to require corrections of the  
plans after they have been approved, it is clearly the intent of the code that the approval of plans  
or the issuance of a permit may not be done in violation of the code or of other pertinent laws or  
ordinances. As the old saying goes,  
“Two wrongs do not make a right.  
”  
105.5 Expiration. The IBC anticipates that once a permit has been issued, construction will soon  
follow and proceed expeditiously until completion. However, this ideal procedure is not always  
the case and, therefore, the code makes provisions for those cases where work has not started, or  
alternatively where the work, after being started, has been suspended for a period of time. In  
these cases, the IBC allows a period of 180 days to transpire before the permit becomes void.  
The code then requires that a new permit be obtained. It is assumed by the code that the code  
compliance agency will have expended some effort in follow-up inspections of the work, etc.,  
and, therefore, the original permit fee may be retained in order to compensate the agency for the  
work. The allowance for full or partial refunds should be addressed by policy under the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationauthorization granted by Section 109.6. The building official has the authority to grant one or  
more extensions of time, provided the permit holder can demonstrate a justifiable cause as to  
why the permit should not be invalidated. The time period for such extensions cannot exceed 180  
days; however, additional extensions may be granted if approved by the building official.  
There are several reasons why it is important to establish a limitation on the validity of a  
permit, such as purging the agency files of inactive permits. Additionally, it keeps the project on  
track with the code edition in effect at the time of permit issuance.  
Section 107 Construction Documents  
Plans, specifications, and other construction documents, along with other applicable data, must  
be filed with the permit application. Such submittal documents are intended to graphically depict  
the construction work to be done. The IBC sets forth the necessary information that must be  
provided to the building official at the time of plans submittal, as well as procedures for deferred  
submittals.  
107.1 General. In this section, the IBC directs that at the time of application for a permit,  
construction documents and other essential data on the project be submitted. The code requires  
that plans, engineering calculations, and any other information necessary to describe the work to  
be done be filed along with the application for a permit. Where geotechnical investigations are  
required, a written report shall be submitted at the time of permit application. A statement of  
special inspections that may be required by Section 1704.2.3 is also to be submitted with the  
application for a permit. Based on the statutes of the jurisdiction, the plans, specifications, and  
other documents may need to be prepared by a registered design professional. Under special  
circumstances, the building official may also require that the submittal documents be prepared by  
a registered design professional even when not mandated by jurisdictional statute. The building  
official is permitted to waive the requirement for the filing of plans and other data, where not  
required by statute to be prepared by a registered design professional, provided the building  
official ensures that the work for which the permit is applied is of such a nature that plans or any  
other data are not necessary in order to indicate and obtain compliance with the code.  
107.3 Examination of documents. In this section, the building official is directed to review the  
plans, specifications, and other submittal documents filed with the permit. The building official  
is not at liberty to check only a portion of the plans. On this basis, the structural drawings, as  
well as the engineering calculations, must be checked in order for the building official to provide  
a full examination.  
107.3.4 Design professional in responsible charge. The building official has the authority to  
require the designation of a design professional to act in responsible charge of the work being  
performed. The function of such an individual is to review and coordinate submittal documents  
prepared by others and, if necessary, coordinate any deferred or phased submittal items. In some  
cases, the design of portions of the building has been completed and may be dependent on the  
manufacturer of proposed prefabricated elements, such as for truss drawings. Therefore, the code  
specifically allows deferring the submittal of portions of plans and specifications.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 108 Temporary Structures and Uses  
This section authorizes the erection of temporary buildings and structures such as those erected  
at construction sites. The regulation of temporary viewing stands and other miscellaneous,  
temporary structures would also fall under this section. Reference is made to Section 3103 for  
the special requirements applicable to temporary buildings. The following are key provisions for  
temporary buildings and structures\:  
1\. 2. 3. They are erected by special permit.  
They are erected for a limited period of time.  
They must conform to the requirements of the IBC for structural strength, fire safety,  
means of egress, accessibility, light, ventilation, and sanitation.  
Section 109 Fees  
Permits required by the jurisdiction are not valid until the appropriate fees have been paid. The  
IBC provides for each individual jurisdiction to establish its own schedules for permit fees. The  
fees collected by the code compliance agency are typically set at a level to adequately cover the  
cost to the agency for services rendered.  
109.3 Permit valuations. The code uses the concept of valuation to establish the permit fee. This  
concept is based on the proposition that the valuation of a project is related to the amount of  
work to be expended in the various aspects of administering the permit. Also, there should be  
some excess in the permit fee to cover agency overhead. Essentially, the valuation is considered  
as the cost of replacing the building. The valuation also includes any electrical, plumbing, and  
mechanical work, even though separate permits may be required for the mechanical, plumbing,  
and electrical trades.  
To provide some uniformity in the determination of valuation so that there is a consistent base  
for the assignment of fees, the IBC directs the building official to determine the value of the  
building. To assist in obtaining uniformity,  
“Building Valuation Data \(BVD\)” can be accessed  
on ICC’s website. Thus, building officials may utilize a common base in their determination of  
the value of buildings. However, ICC strongly recommends that all jurisdictions and other  
interested parties actively evaluate and assess the impact of the BVD table before utilizing it in  
their current code enforcement activities. As an option, any other appropriate method may also  
be used by the jurisdiction as the basis for determining the proper valuation of the work.  
109.4 Work commencing before permit issuance. When work requiring a permit is started  
without such a permit, the IBC allows the building official to assess an additional fee above and  
beyond the required permit fees. This fee is intended to compensate the code compliance agency  
for any additional time and effort necessary in evaluating the work initiated without a permit. It  
may often be necessary for the building official to cause an investigation to be made of the work  
already done. The intent of the investigation is to determine to what extent the work completed  
complies with the code, and to describe with as much detail as possible the work that has been  
completed.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation109.6 Refunds. This section authorizes the building official to establish a policy for partial or  
complete refunds of fees paid to the department. Although not specified in the code, there are a  
variety of reasons why some level of a fee refund would be appropriate. One instance would be  
where the permit fee is collected in error. Another reason for authorizing a refund of the fees  
paid would be that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant caused delays and the  
eventual expiration of the building permit. Typically, the building official will withhold from the  
refund any monies expended by the agency for related administrative activities that have taken  
place. It should be noted that the building official, when approving a fee refund, is authorizing  
the disbursement of public funds. Therefore, the building official must be sure that there is good  
cause for the refund to the applicant.  
Section 110 Inspections  
The inspection function is arguably the most critical aspect of code compliance agency  
operations. An important concept views that, as with the issuance of permits, inspections that  
presume to give authority to violations of the code are invalid. In general, the IBC charges the  
permit applicant with the responsibility of ensuring that the work to be inspected remain  
accessible and exposed until it is approved. Any expense incurred in the process of providing for  
an accessible and exposed inspection, such as the removal of gypsum board or insulation, is not  
to be borne by the building official or jurisdiction. Therefore, it is critical that work should not  
proceed beyond the point where an inspection is required.  
110.3 Required inspections. The code mandates a variety of inspections during the progress of  
construction. Several such inspections are common to almost all types of buildings, including\:  
• Footing and foundation inspection  
• Concrete slab and/or under-floor inspection  
• Frame inspection  
• Gypsum board, gypsum panel product, and/or lath inspection  
• Energy efficiency inspection  
• Final inspection  
These inspections are critical in ensuring the construction is compliant with the provisions of  
the code as in many cases such verification would be difficult to achieve.  
Fire-resistance-rated and/or smoke-resistant elements are often constructed with the  
inspection of penetration and joint protectives necessary. Where balconies and elevated surfaces  
are considered as weather-exposed and the structural framing is protected by an impervious  
moisture barrier, elements of the moisture barrier system must be inspected. The inspection of  
wood cover providing fire-resistance ratings in Type IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C buildings is also  
mandated. Special inspections as addressed in Section 1705 require special expertise to ensure  
compliance. Another type of inspection is required in flood hazard areas. After the lowest floor  
elevation is established, but prior to additional vertical construction, the required elevation  
certification shall be submitted to the building official.  
The code also gives the building official the authority to require and make other inspections  
where necessary to determine compliance with the code and other laws and regulations enforced  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationby the code compliance agency. There are times where unique concerns of the jurisdiction make  
it necessary to provide some degree of inspection. Where such review is necessary, the  
inspections should be handled in a manner consistent with those specifically identified in the  
IBC.  
In each case for the required inspections identified in Section 110.3, the IBC is very specific  
as to how far the construction must have progressed prior to a request for an inspection. If it is  
necessary to make a re-inspection because work has not progressed to the point where it is ready  
for inspection, the building official may charge an additional fee under the general provisions of  
Section 109. A re-inspection fee is not specifically mandated, however, and normally would not  
be assessed unless the person doing the work continually calls for inspections before the work is  
ready for inspection. Such actions would typically cause increased costs to the jurisdiction not  
covered by the original building permit.  
110.5 Inspection requests. In general, the IBC charges the individual holding the building  
permit with notifying the code compliance agency when it is time to make an inspection. The  
permit holder may also authorize one or more agents for this responsibility. The code places a  
duty upon the permit holder or their authorized agent to have the work to be inspected accessible  
and exposed, so it can be evaluated as to code compliance.  
110.6 Approval required. The code intends that no work shall be done beyond the point where  
an inspection is required until the work requiring inspection has been approved. Moreover, it is  
intended that work requiring inspection not be covered until it has been inspected and approved.  
Section 111 Certificate of Occupancy  
The tool that the building official utilizes to control the uses and occupancies of the various  
buildings and structures within the jurisdiction is the certificate of occupancy. The IBC makes it  
unlawful to use or occupy a building or structure unless a certificate of occupancy has been  
issued for that use. Furthermore, the code imposes the duty of issuing a certificate of occupancy  
upon the building official when they are satisfied that the building, or portion thereof, complies  
with the code for the intended use and occupancy.  
Prior to use or occupancy of the building, the building official shall perform a final inspection  
as addressed in Section 110.3.12. If no violations of the code and other laws enforced by the  
code compliance agency are found, the building official is required to issue a certificate of  
occupancy. Figure 111-1 illustrates the information that must be provided on the certificate of  
occupancy.  
Where a portion of a building is intended to be occupied prior to occupancy of the entire  
structure, the building official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy. This situation  
would occur where partial occupancy is requested prior to completion of all work authorized by  
the building permit. Prior to issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy, it is critical that  
the building official ascertain that those portions to be occupied provide the minimum levels of  
safety required by the code. In addition, the building official shall establish a definitive length of  
time for the temporary certificate of occupancy to be valid.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 111-1 Certificate of occupancy.  
In essence, the certificate of occupancy certifies that the described building, or portion  
thereof, complies with the requirements of the code for the intended use and occupancy, except  
as provided for existing buildings undergoing a change of occupancy as regulated by the  
International Existing Building Code \(IEBC\). However, any certificate of occupancy may be  
suspended or revoked by the building official under one of three conditions\: \(1\) where the  
certificate is issued in error, \(2\) where incorrect information is supplied to the building official,  
or \(3\) where it is determined that the building or a portion of the building is in violation of the  
code or any other ordinance or regulation of the jurisdiction. The most common reason for  
suspending or revoking a certificate of occupancy is that the building is being used for a purpose  
other than that intended when approval for occupancy was granted. When a permit is issued,  
plans reviewed, inspections made, and a certificate of occupancy given, there is an expectation  
that the building will be used for specific activities. As such, the hazards associated with such  
activities can be addressed. However, where an unanticipated use occurs, there is the potential  
that the necessary safeguards are not in place to address the related hazards. An unauthorized use  
can be intentional or unintentional; however, it is no less a concern until the use is discontinued  
or the necessary remedies are in place.  
A key distinction in the application of the IBC concerns the terms “use” and “occupancy.  
”  
Most buildings have multiple uses, but often contain only a single occupancy. For example, an  
office building may have business areas, small storage areas, and small assembly areas, as well  
as support areas such as restrooms and mechanical equipment rooms. Although multiple uses  
occur in the building, it only contains a single occupancy, Group B. It is anticipated that all of  
the hazards that are anticipated as part of the building’s function can be effectively addressed  
through classification as a single occupancy group.  
The definition’s reference to a change in purpose or level of activity is not intended to address  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationminor changes in use that are typical when new ownership or tenancy occurs. Rather, the need  
for a new certificate of occupancy only occurs where change results in an increase in hazard  
level. As an example, where a Group B business office building undergoes a change of use to a  
Group B ambulatory care facility, additional fire- and life-safety safeguards are necessary in  
order to address the increased hazard due to the possible presence of health-care recipients who  
will be temporarily incapable of self-preservation. Although both types of facilities are classified  
as Group B occupancies, there is a distinct difference in their uses, and, as such, a new certificate  
of occupancy must be issued to address the change. Conversely, the provisions are not intended  
to require a new certificate of occupancy where the change in purpose or activity creates little, if  
any, change in hazard level. For example, a change from a Group M grocery store to a Group M  
electronics store would not require issuance of a new certificate of occupancy. In an evaluation  
of whether a change of occupancy occurs, the relationship of the new use to that of the previous  
use must undergo an evaluation conducted in accordance with the definition of “change of  
occupancy” in Chapter 2.  
Section 112 Service Utilities  
The building official is authorized to control the connection release for any service utility where  
the connection occurs to a building or system regulated by the IBC. Such authority also includes  
the temporary connection of the service utility. Perhaps even more important, the building  
official is also granted authority for the disconnection of service utilities where it has been  
determined that an immediate hazard to life or property exists. As in all administrative functions,  
it is important that due process be followed.  
Section 113 Means of Appeals  
The IBC intends that the board of appeals have the authority to hear and decide appeals of orders  
and decisions of the building official relative to the application and interpretations of the code.  
However, the code specifically denies the authority of the board relative to waivers of code  
requirements. Based on the qualification level set forth by the code for board membership, it can  
be assumed that the board is intended as fundamentally a technical body. Any broader authority  
may place the board outside of its area of expertise, such as addressing internal administrative  
issues of the agency. It should be noted that the board’s role is to hear and decide on appeals of  
decisions made by the building official. Until the building official makes their determination, the  
issue is not subject to board review.  
The importance of a board of appeals should not be taken lightly. Its role is equivalent to that  
of the building official when it comes to technical questions placed before it, thus the need for  
highly qualified board members. The board is not merely advisory in its actions, but rather is  
granted the authority to overturn the decisions of the building official where the determination is  
within the scope as described by the code. An example would be an appeal requesting the use of  
an alternative method of construction previously denied by the building official. The alternative  
method would be permitted if found by the board to be equivalent to or better than that set forth  
in the code. Where the board of appeals is desired to take on a more expansive role, such as code  
adoption review or contractor licensing oversight, those duties should be specifically granted by  
the jurisdiction. More detailed information on the qualifications and duties of a board of appeals  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationis found in IBC Appendix B.  
Section 114 Violations  
The provisions of this section establish that violations of the code are considered unlawful and  
such violations shall be abated. Where necessary, a notice of violation may be served by the  
building official to the individual responsible for the work that is in violation of the code. Further  
action may be taken where there is a lack of compliance with the notice. The jurisdiction shall  
establish penalties based on the various specified violations.  
Section 115 Stop Work Order  
The stop work order is a tool authorized by the IBC to enable the building official to demand that  
work on a building or structure be temporarily suspended. Intended to be utilized only under rare  
circumstances, this order may be issued where the work being performed is dangerous, unsafe, or  
significantly contrary to the provisions of the code. A stop work order is often a building  
official’s final method in obtaining compliance on issues of extreme importance. All other  
reasonable avenues should be considered prior to the issuance of such an order.  
The stop work order shall be a written document indicating the reason or reasons for the work  
to be suspended. It shall also identify those conditions where compliance is necessary before the  
cited work is allowed to resume. All work addressed by the order shall immediately cease upon  
issuance. It is important that the stop work order be presented to the owner of the subject  
property, the agent of the owner, or the individual doing the work. Only after all issues have been  
satisfied may work continue. Because of the potential consequences involved with shutting down  
a construction project, it is critical that the appropriate procedures be followed. Although a stop  
work order can be issued at any time during the construction process, the most common  
application of the provision is where work has commenced before or without the issuance of a  
building permit. The order is given to notify those affected parties that all work be stopped until  
a valid permit is obtained. An example of a stop work order is shown in Figure 115-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 115-1 Stop work order.  
Section 116 Unsafe Structures and Equipment  
The provisions of this section are intended to define what constitutes an unsafe building and  
unsafe use of a building. Unsafe buildings and structures are considered public nuisances and  
require repair or abatement. The abatement procedures are indicated in this section, including the  
creation of a report on the nature of the unsafe condition. Written notice shall be provided and  
the method of service of such notice is specified in Section 116.4. Where restoration or repair of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe building is desired, the provisions of the IEBC for existing buildings are appropriate.  
KEY POINTS  
• The IBC provides minimum standards to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of the  
public.  
• Rendering interpretations of specific code provisions is the responsibility of the  
building official, to be based on the purpose and intent of the code.  
• Modifications to specific IBC provisions may be acceptable where strict application of  
the code is impractical.  
• Alternative designs, materials, and methods of construction to those detailed in the code  
are to be evaluated by the building official based on an equivalency to the prescribed  
regulations.  
• Tests may be mandated by the building official in order to verify compliance with the  
code.  
• The issuance of permits, plan review, and inspection of construction for which permits  
have been issued constitutes the bulk of the duties of the typical code compliance  
agency.  
• The code intends that the issuance of a permit should not be construed as allowing a  
violation of the code or any other local ordinance applicable to the building.  
• Submittal documents must be appropriately submitted to the building official for  
review, and approved prior to receiving a building permit.  
• The building official has the authority to require the designation of a registered design  
professional to review and coordinate submittal documents prepared by others.  
• A certificate of occupancy, granted by the building official, indicates that the structure  
is lawfully permitted to be occupied.  
• The board of appeals provides a mechanism for individuals to challenge the  
interpretation of the building official on technical issues in the IBC.

# DEFINITIONS  
Section 201 General  
Section 202 Definitions  
Key Points  
A number of definitions are applicable specifically to the International Building Code® \(IBC®\)  
and may not have an appropriate definition for code purposes in the dictionary. Therefore,  
over 700 words and terms are defined in this chapter to assist the user in the proper application  
of the requirements. Those words and terms specifically defined in the code are italicized  
where they occur throughout the text in order to identify the user that a specific definition can  
be found in this chapter. Although infrequent, the definitions of some terms are contained  
within the text of the requirement. For example, the definition of day care is implied in the  
description of Group E occupancies. Other frequently used and significant terms are undefined  
\(i.e., 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction\), and their meaning can be discerned only from  
their context. There are numerous definitions in this chapter, but only selected definitions are  
included in this commentary  
Section 201 General  
An important feature of this section is the requirement that ordinarily accepted meanings be used  
for definitions that are not provided in the code. Such meanings are based on the context in  
which the term or terms appear. The code defines terms that have specific intents and meanings  
insofar as the code is concerned, and leaves it up to the user to apply all undefined terms in the  
manner in which they are ordinarily used. Where there is any question as to the meaning or  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationapplication of a particular definition, the building official shall make the determination under the  
interpretive authority granted in Section 104.1 based on the context and intent of the term’s  
usage in the code.  
Section 202 Definitions  
ACCESSIBLE MEANS OF EGRESS. In concert with efforts to make buildings accessible and  
usable for persons with disabilities, it is necessary that safe egress for individuals with  
disabilities also be provided. Therefore, accessible egress paths of continuous and unobstructed  
travel are required. Generally consistent with the provisions of other exiting systems, an  
accessible means of egress shall begin at any accessible point within the building and continue  
until reaching the public way. The primary provisions regulating accessible means of egress are  
located in Section 1009.  
AISLE. Where furniture, fixtures, and equipment limit the potential travel paths within the  
means of egress system, aisles and aisle accessways are created. Typically, aisles accept the  
contribution of occupant travel from adjoining aisle accessways. At times, multiple aisles may  
converge into a main aisle, which then may lead to exit access doorways or exits. Aisles are  
common throughout most buildings and are considered portions of the exit access. Aisles in most  
applications are addressed in Section 1018. Those aisles, including stepped aisles, that are  
present in assembly seating areas are regulated by Section 1030.  
AISLE ACCESSWAY. The path of travel from an occupiable point in a building to an aisle is  
considered to be an aisle accessway. Often called a “row” in everyday language when adjacent to  
seats or fixtures, an aisle accessway is typically used by small numbers of people prior to  
converging with other persons at an aisle. An example of aisle accessways regulated by Section  
1018 is shown in Figure 202-1. Where aisle accessways occur in assembly seating areas, such as  
found in theaters and arenas, they must comply with the provisions of Section 1030.  
ALTERNATING TREAD DEVICE. By appearance more of a ladder than a stairway, an  
alternating tread device is shown in Figure 202-2. Typically, steps are supported by a center rail  
placed at a severe angle from the floor. The key difference between this device and other forms  
of stairways addressed in the IBC is that the user, by nature of the design of the device, can never  
have both feet on the same level at the same time. The use of an alternating tread device is  
selectively permitted in certain areas not occupiable by the public, some of which are identified  
in Section 1011.14.

AMBULATORY CARE FACILITY. Facilities where individuals are provided with medical  
care on less than a 24-hour basis are classified as Group B occupancies. However, two separate  
definitions highlight the fact that there are two unique types of persons that occupy such  
facilities. The important difference involves the self-preservation capabilities of the individuals.  
Where the occupants are capable of self-preservation \(the ability to respond to emergency  
situations without assistance from others\) throughout the period of time in which they are at the  
facility, the building is considered an “outpatient clinic” as defined in this chapter. If such self-  
preservation cannot be accomplished due to the application of sedation or similar procedures, or  
where the care recipients are already incapable of self-preservation upon arrival, then the facility  
is by definition an “ambulatory care facility.  
” The need for separate definitions is due to special  
provisions in Section 422 that specifically regulate those types of facilities where individuals are  
temporarily or permanently incapable of self-preservation. Ambulatory care facilities are more  
highly regulated than outpatient clinics in regard to smoke compartmentation, incidental uses,  
automatic sprinkler system protection, and fire alarm system requirements.  
ANNULAR SPACE. The open space created around the outside of a pipe, conduit, or similar  
penetrating item where it passes through a vertical or horizontal assembly is considered the  
annular space. The code addresses methods to maintain the integrity of a fire-resistance-rated  
assembly, including methods to protect any annular space around a penetration.  
APPROVED. Throughout the code, the term approved is used to describe a specific component,  
material, or method of construction, such as approved automatic flush bolts mentioned in Section  
1010.2.4, Item 4, or an approved barrier in interior exit stairways addressed in Section 1023.8.  
Where approved is used, it merely means that such a design, material, or method of construction  
is acceptable to the building official \(or other authority having jurisdiction\), based on the intent  
of the code. It would seem appropriate that the building official base their decision of approval  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationon the result of investigations or tests, if applicable, or by reason of accepted principles.  
AREA OF REFUGE. It is common for an area of refuge to be included as a portion of the  
accessible means of egress in a nonsprinklered multistory building. The intent of the refuge area  
is to provide a location where individuals unable to use stairways can gather to await assistance  
or instructions during an emergency evacuation of the building. The size and construction  
requirements for areas of refuge are provided in Section 1009.6.  
ATRIUM. The recognition of an atrium in the IBC as more than just a design feature is due to  
the openings between stories that pose a significant hazard under fire conditions. In order to  
address this unique approach to vertical openness, special provisions were established in the  
1980s to provide alternative protection through concepts applicable to both open courts and shaft  
enclosures. Requirements specific to atriums are set forth in Section 404.  
The definition of atrium is limited to addressing two conditions\: \(1\) an atrium is a vertical  
space enclosed at the top, and \(2\) an atrium typically connects three or more stories. Where no  
more than two stories are open to each other, there are multiple allowances in Section 712.1 that  
allow such openness without consideration or regulation as an atrium.  
It is important to note that there may be limited circumstances where an open two-story  
condition exists and one or more of the requirements of Section 712.1.9 cannot be met. In such  
situations, by definition, an atrium condition cannot be considered due to the “three-story”  
threshold. However, if a complying atrium can be considered as an acceptable approach to  
addressing a vertical opening of three or more stories, it should also be acceptable where the  
opening connects only two stories.  
ATTIC. Several provisions apply to the attic area of a building, such as those relating to  
ventilation of the attic space. In order to fully clarify the portion of a building defined as an attic,  
this chapter identifies an attic as the space between the ceiling framing at the top story and the  
underside of the roof deck, slab, or sheathing. An attic designation is appropriate only if the area  
is not considered occupiable. Where this area has a floor, it would typically be defined as a story.  
A common misuse of IBC terminology is the designation of a space as a habitable or occupiable  
attic. Such a designation is inappropriate insofar as once such a space is utilized for some degree  
of occupancy, it is no longer deemed an attic.  
BASEMENT. A basement is considered to be any story that does not meet the definition of  
“story above grade plane.  
” There are limited provisions in the code that are specifically  
applicable to basements. One such significant requirement is established in Section 903.2.11.1.3  
mandating the sprinklering of basements where adequate exterior openings are not provided. In  
short, the code regulates a below-ground story based on its qualification as a story above grade  
plane. See the commentary in this chapter on Story Above Grade Plane.  
BLEACHERS. Structures designed for seating purposes containing tiered or stepped seating  
two or more rows high are considered bleachers. The definition of “grandstand” is identical to  
that of bleachers, recognizing that the terms are interchangeable. Bleachers may, or may not, be  
provided with backrests. In addition, bleachers may be located either inside or outside a  
structure. The specific provisions for bleachers are found in ICC 300, Bleachers, Folding and  
Telescopic Seating, and Grandstands. Similar seating areas that are considered as building  
elements would not be defined as bleachers and are not regulated by ICC 300. A building  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationelement, also defined in Section 202, is deemed to be a fundamental component of the building’s  
construction as listed in Table 601.  
BUILDING AREA. The term building area describes that portion of the building’s floor area to  
be utilized in the determination of whether or not a structure complies with the provisions of  
Chapter 5 for allowable building size. It is not to be confused with the term floor area, which is  
the basis for occupant-load determination in Chapter 10 for means of egress evaluation, nor the  
term fire area as used in the application of automatic sprinkler requirements in Chapter 9.  
The definition of building area is the area included within the surrounding exterior walls of  
the building, and the definition further states that the floor area of a building or portion thereof  
not provided with surrounding exterior walls shall be the usable area under the horizontal  
projection of the roof or floor above. The intent of this latter provision is to address where a  
structure may not have exterior walls or may have one or more sides open without an enclosing  
exterior wall. Examples would include a canopy covering pump islands at a service station, or  
the covered drive-through area of a fast food restaurant. Where a column line establishes the  
outer perimeter of the usable space under the roof, it is also typically the extent of building area.  
Beyond the column line, the overhead cover is simply viewed as a projection. See Figure 202-3.  
If all of the area beneath the roof above can be considered usable space, then the building area is  
measured to the leading edge of the roof above. See Figure 202-4.  
BUILDING ELEMENT. Primary structural frame members, bearing walls, nonbearing walls  
and partitions, floor construction including secondary members, and roof construction including  
secondary members are considered to be building elements for the purposes of the IBC. Such  
elements are primarily regulated based on two criteria\: fire resistance and combustibility. In  
determining a building’s type of construction, the building elements are evaluated based on the  
criteria previously mentioned.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-3 Building area.  
Figure 202-4 Building area.  
BUILDING OFFICIAL. Regardless of title, the individual who is designated by the jurisdiction  
as the person who administers and enforces the IBC is considered by the code to be the building  
official. In addition, all other individuals who have been given a similar enforcement authority,  
such as plans examiners and inspectors, are also considered building officials to a limited degree  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationunder the IBC. A further discussion of the duties and responsibilities of the building official is  
found in the commentary on Section 104.  
CARE SUITE. Special means of egress provisions are provided in Section 407.4.4 for care  
suites in Group I-2 occupancies. The definition of “care suite” establishes the scope of such  
special provisions. The concept of suites recognizes those arrangements where staff must have  
more supervision of care recipients in specific treatment and sleeping rooms. Therefore, the  
general means of egress requirements are typically not appropriate under such conditions. The  
special allowances for care suites are not intended to apply to day rooms or business functions of  
the health-care facility. Intensive-care and critical-care units are typically configured as care  
suites.  
CEILING RADIATION DAMPER. Designed to protect air openings that occur in fire-  
resistance-rated roof/ceiling or floor/ceiling assemblies, ceiling radiation dampers are listed  
devices that automatically limit the radiative heat transfer from a room or space into the cavity  
above the ceiling. The damper, in conjunction with the fire-resistive ceiling membrane, protects  
the structural system within the floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assembly from failure that is due to  
excessive heat.  
CHANGE OF OCCUPANCY. Every building, or portion of a building, must be assigned an  
occupancy classification with respect to its use by placing it into one of the specific occupancy  
groups identified in Chapter 3. These groups are used throughout the code to address everything  
from allowable building size to required fire protection features. The occupancy classification  
process represents identifying a distinct hazard, or more typically a group of hazards, that must  
be specifically addressed throughout the applicable code requirements. For example, the  
classification of Group A recognizes those assembly-related concerns associated with theaters,  
night clubs, places of worship, and other facilities where large numbers of people congregate in a  
concentrated manner. Where there is a change in the use of the building that modifies the type or  
extent of the hazards created by the new use, a change of occupancy occurs.  
Where no change in occupancy classification occurs, a change of occupancy exists only in  
those buildings where \(1\) there is a change in a building’s purpose or level of activity, \(2\) that  
functional change is such that the current IBC requires a greater degree of regulation than  
presently exists in the current building, and \(3\) the greater degree of regulation required by the  
current IBC occurs only in the areas of accessibility, structural strength, fire protection, means of  
egress, ventilation, or sanitation. The intent is to limit the application of a change of occupancy  
where there is no change in classification to only those new uses that present a higher risk to the  
life safety or welfare of the occupants than was created by the previous use.  
It is generally accepted that where a change from one occupancy group to another group, such  
as from a Group B to a Group M, as well as a change of divisions within an individual group,  
such as from a Group F-2 to a Group F-1, constitutes a change of occupancy. However, due to  
the scope of the definition, there is a question as to how to address a building that undergoes a  
change in occupancy classification where no greater degree of safety, accessibility, structural  
strength, fire protection, means of egress, ventilation, or sanitation is required by the code. An  
example is the remodeling of a Group A-2 assembly space in a manner where it would be  
reclassified as Group B. Where the new use poses an equal or lesser hazard level, but such use is  
classified as a different occupancy, it would seem appropriate to also consider it as a change of  
occupancy even though no modifications would be required.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationCOMMON PATH OF EGRESS TRAVEL. It is important to limit the distance of egress travel  
that occurs where only a single path or single point of egress is available to the user of the means  
of egress. For this reason, such limited travel is regulated as a common path of egress travel.  
Very similar to the concept addressed in the limitations of dead-end conditions in corridors, the  
intent of regulations regarding a common path of egress travel is based on the lack of at least two  
separate and distinct paths of egress travel toward two or more remote exits. Every room, space,  
or area that only has access to one exit access doorway or exit must be regulated for common  
path limitations. Included as the initial part of the permitted travel distance, a common path of  
egress travel only occurs within the exit access portion of the means of egress. See Figure 202-5.  
Figure 202-5 Common path of egress travel.  
CORRIDOR. A corridor is considered a component of the exit access portion of the means of  
egress that provides an enclosed and directed route of egress travel along the path to an exit.  
Regulated by Section 1020, corridors may or may not be required to be fire-resistance rated, but  
in all cases, an enclosure of some sort is anticipated. The determination as to whether or not a  
design element is to be regulated as a corridor is to be made by the building official. Many  
factors may be considered prior to making this determination, which could possibly include  
length, degree of enclosure, length-to-width ratio, adjacent spaces, and other considerations.  
However, because of the reliance upon corridors as an important egress element, it is critical that  
they be appropriately regulated. A corridor’s primary purpose is for the movement of occupants,  
both as a part of the building’s circulation and its use as a means of egress. Although some  
spaces may have one or more of the characteristics of a corridor as previously mentioned \(length,  
degree of enclosure, length-to-width ratio, etc.\), their primary function is that of rooms, and they  
should not be considered corridors. A classic example can be found in many observation  
buildings in zoos, where a very long, narrow element is used as a means for occupants to view  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdisplays of wildlife. Although in plan view it may appear to be a corridor, it actually functions as  
a room and should be regulated as such. It should be noted that the placement of a few pieces of  
furniture or equipment within a corridor in an effort to consider the space a room rather than a  
corridor is not appropriate. It should be noted that corridors are never mandated by the IBC, but  
rather are utilized as design elements. Where provided, however, such components must comply  
with the code.  
COURT. Open and unobstructed to the sky above, an exterior area is considered a court where it  
is enclosed on at least three sides by exterior walls of the building or other enclosing elements,  
such as a screen wall. Regulations for courts, including those used for egress purposes, are found  
throughout the code. Examples of courts are shown in Figure 202-6. Although the IBC does not  
mandate a minimum depth for consideration as a court, it is expected that certain design and  
structural features of the building that create minor exterior wall offsets would not require  
designation as a court. The determination of the presence of a court under such conditions is  
subject to the building official’s discretion.  
COVERED MALL BUILDING. A covered mall building consists of various tenants and  
occupancies, as well as the common pedestrian areas that provide access to the tenant spaces.  
Although the most common tenants of covered mall buildings are retail stores, various other uses  
are also commonly found in such a structure. Restaurants, drinking establishments, entertainment  
and amusement facilities, passenger transportation terminals such as airports and bus stations,  
offices, and other similar uses are often located in a covered mall building. There are a limited  
number of access points to a covered mall building; therefore, the tenants share a few major  
entrances into the mall. Although an anchor building is not to be considered a part of the covered  
mall building, it is possible to design an exterior perimeter building as merely another of the  
tenants within the covered mall building. It has become increasingly popular to create large-scale  
projects resembling covered mall buildings without roofs over the pedestrian circulation areas.  
Various “tenant space” buildings and “anchor buildings” are situated around unroofed pedestrian  
ways \(open malls\) in a manner very similar to that for covered mall buildings. The inclusion of  
open mall buildings in the IBC recognizes that the same benefits should be available as for  
enclosed structures, provided the appropriate measures are taken. Where the mall area is open to  
the sky, equivalent or better life safety and property protection is provided.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-6 Definition of courts.  
When one thinks of a covered mall building, its use is typically associated with retail sales  
and related activities. However, the provisions of Section 402 may also lend themselves to other  
occupancies such as office uses and transportation facilities. Recently, more attention has been  
given to the application of the covered mall building concept to large educational buildings.  
Many of the characteristics of an exciting and efficient school environment are consistent with  
those of a covered mall building, including spacious areas open to each other, vertical interaction  
between floor levels, ease of supervision, and limited points of entry. Educational facilities even  
have their own anchor buildings such as the auditorium, gymnasium, media center, and other  
spaces. However, because the criteria of Section 402 are more traditional in their approach, some  
of the provisions cannot be directly applied to an educational occupancy. It will be necessary to  
utilize the alternate methods and design allowance in Section 104.11 to more specifically address  
those issues.  
DOOR, BALANCED. Balanced doors are a special type of double-pivoted door in which the  
pivot point is located some distance in from the door edge, thus creating a counter-balancing  
effect.  
DRAFTSTOP. Required by the code only in concealed areas of combustible construction,  
draftstops are utilized in large concealed spaces to limit air movement, which is accomplished  
through the subdivision of such spaces. Draftstops are to be constructed of those materials or  
construction identified by the IBC that effectively create smaller compartments within attics and  
similar areas.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationDWELLING UNIT AND DWELLING. A dwelling unit is considered a single unit that  
provides living facilities for one or more persons. Dwelling units include permanent provisions  
for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation, thus providing a complete independent living  
arrangement. A dwelling unit, while typically addressed in the IBC as a portion of a Group R-2  
occupancy, may also be classified as Group I-1, R-1, or R-3. A dwelling is a building that  
contains either one or two dwelling units. Dwellings are typically regulated under the provisions  
of the International Residential Code® \(IRC®\), as noted in the exception to IBC Section 101.2.  
EGRESS COURT. That portion of the exit discharge at ground level that extends from a  
required exit to the public way is considered an egress court. An egress court may be a yard, a  
court, or a combination of a yard and a court that extends from the end point of an exit, typically  
an exterior door at grade level, until it reaches a public way. An example is illustrated in Figure  
202-7.  
EMERGENCY ESCAPE AND RESCUE OPENING. Required in sleeping rooms and  
basements in limited residential occupancies, emergency escape and rescue openings are  
intended to allow for a secondary means of escape or rescue in the event of an emergency.  
Typically an operable window or door, such an exterior opening is regulated by Section 1031 for  
minimum size, maximum opening height from the floor, and operational constraints. Although  
the provisions are found in Chapter 10 of the code, the intent of the opening is for emergency  
escape or rescue access, and it is not intended to be considered an element of a complying means  
of egress.  
Figure 202-7 Egress court.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationEXIT. An exit is the first portion of egress travel where the code assumes that the occupant has  
obtained an adequate level of safety so that travel distance limitations are no longer a concern. In  
addition, an exit typically provides only single-direction egress travel. The adequate level of  
safety is provided by building elements that completely separate the means of egress from other  
interior spaces in the building. Inside the building, fire-resistance-rated construction and opening  
protectives are utilized to provide a protective path of egress travel between the exit access and  
exit discharge portions of the means of egress. Building elements that are considered exits  
include exterior exit doors at the level of exit discharge, interior exit stairways and ramps, exit  
passageways, exterior exit stairways, exterior exit ramps, and horizontal exits.  
EXIT ACCESS. The exit access is identified as the initial component of the means of egress  
system, the portion between any occupied point in a building and the exit. Leading to one or  
more of the defined exit components, the exit access makes up the vast majority of any  
building’s floor area. Because the exit access begins at any point that may potentially be  
occupied, it is probable that only those concealed areas, such as penthouses, attics, and under-  
floor spaces that are typically unoccupied, fall outside the scope of the means of egress.  
EXIT ACCESS DOORWAY. The term “exit access doorway” is commonly used in IBC  
Chapter 10 to establish a reference point within the exit access for applying various means of  
egress provisions, including those addressing arrangement, number, separation, opening  
protection, and exit sign placement. Although one would expect the term “doorway” to be  
limited to those situations where an actual door opening, either with or without a door, is present,  
the IBC definition expands this traditional meaning by including certain access points that do not  
necessarily include doorways, such as at unenclosed exit access stairs and ramps. In fact, any  
point at which the exit access is narrowed so as to create a single point of travel could potentially  
be considered as an exit access doorway, as shown in Figure 202-8 where a narrow, directed path  
of egress travel is provided.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-8 Exit access doorway.  
EXIT ACCESS STAIRWAY. Stairways intended to serve as required exit components within  
the means of egress are considered as interior exit stairways. All other stairways are regulated as  
exit access stairways. As expected, an exit access stairway is considered an exit access  
component of the egress system. Exit access stairways, like most other exit access components,  
are not intended to provide any type of fire-resistive protection for the building occupants as they  
travel through the means of egress. Thus, most exit access stairways are permitted to be  
unenclosed under the allowances of Section 1019.3. However, since stairways create vertical  
openings between stories, enclosure may be required under some conditions to restrict the  
vertical spread of fire, smoke, and gases. Exit access stairways may selectively serve as a portion  
of the required means of egress, while non-required stairways \(convenience stairs\) are also  
considered as exit access stairways.  
EXIT DISCHARGE. Exit discharge is the final portion of the three-part means of egress system  
and is that portion between the point where occupants leave an exit and the point where they  
reach a public way. For conceptual ease, all exterior egress travel at ground level is considered a  
part of the exit discharge. An egress court is the primary component of exit discharge. Regulated  
in Section 1028.2, limited interior exit discharge is also permitted under specified conditions.  
EXIT DISCHARGE, LEVEL OF. The story within a building where an exit terminates and the  
exit discharge begins creates a condition defined as the level of exit discharge. Because exit  
discharge occurs substantially at ground level, the level of exit discharge typically provides a  
horizontal path of travel toward the public way. At times, the code uses this term to define  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationanother floor level’s relationship to egress at grade level. For example, in most buildings, the  
first story above the level of exit discharge is typically the building’s second story above grade  
plane, as shown in Figure 202-9. Where a mezzanine or similar floor level change occurs within  
the first story above grade plane, it is not considered as located above the level of exit discharge.  
Rather, its location is viewed as within the level of exit discharge.  
Figure 202-9 Level of exit discharge.  
EXIT, HORIZONTAL. The horizontal exit is considered a component of the exit portion of the  
means of egress. The concept of a horizontal exit is to provide a refuge compartment adequately  
separated from fire, smoke, and gases generated in the area of a fire incident. As the occupants  
pass through the horizontal exit, they enter an area intended to afford safety from the fire and  
smoke of the area from which they departed. The concept of a horizontal exit is much different  
from the other exit elements set forth in the IBC, as its primary function is a refuge area rather  
than a path of egress travel.  
EXIT PASSAGEWAY. Much like an interior exit stairway or ramp in providing smoke and fire  
protection, an exit passageway is an exit component that is separated from the remainder of the  
building by fire-resistance-rated construction and opening protectives. The horizontal path of  
protected travel afforded by an exit passageway often extends to the exit discharge or the public  
way. An exit passageway is often utilized as the horizontal extension of egress travel connecting  
an interior exit stairway or ramp to the exterior of the building. Its function is to maintain a level  
of occupant protection equivalent to that of the interior exit stairway or ramp to which it is  
connected. An exit passageway is also to be used for protected horizontal travel where the  
continuity of an interior exit stairway or ramp enclosure must extend to another enclosure.  
Occasionally, an exit passageway is utilized by the designer as a means to provide compliance  
with travel distance, exit separation, or other means of egress provision.  
EXTERIOR EXIT STAIRWAY. To be classified as an exterior exit stairway, it must be open  
on at least one side. The open side must then adjoin an open area such as a yard, egress court, or  
public way. By preventing full enclosure of the stairway, an exterior exit stairway will be  
sufficiently open to the exterior to prevent the accumulation of smoke and toxic gases.  
Additional criteria for defining an exterior exit stairway used as a means of egress are found in  
Section 1027.3.  
F RATING. Through-penetration firestop systems and perimeter fire containment systems are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprovided with F ratings to indicate the time periods in which they limit the spread of fire through  
the penetration or void. Tested to the requirements of ASTM E814 or UL 1479, penetration  
firestop systems for fire-resistance-rated assemblies will typically have an F rating no less than  
the required rating of the assembly penetrated. Perimeter fire containment systems are generally  
required to be tested in accordance with ASTM E2307 requirements.  
FIRE AREA. Many of the provisions of Section 903 requiring the installation of automatic  
sprinkler systems utilize the fire area concept. A fire area is considered a compartment that will  
contain a fire such that the maximum fire size will be limited to the size of the compartment. An  
in-depth review of fire areas is found in the discussion of Section 901.7.  
FIRE BARRIER. Fire-resistance-rated walls are considered fire barriers if constructed under  
the provisions of Section 707. The purpose of such assemblies is to create a barrier that will  
restrict fire spread to and from other portions of the building. All openings within a fire barrier  
must be protected with a fire-protective assembly. Fire barriers are often utilized to separate  
incompatible uses within the building, to create fire areas, or to provide for egress through a  
protected exit system. Fire barriers may selectively be fire-resistance-rated at 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours.  
FIRE DAMPER. Regulated by test standard UL 555, fire dampers are devices located in ducts  
and air-transfer openings to restrict the passage of flames. Fire dampers close automatically upon  
the detection of heat, maintaining the integrity of the fire-resistance-rated assembly that is  
penetrated. The actuation of fire dampers creates some restriction to airflow from migrating  
throughout the duct system or through transfer openings, although not to the level of that  
required for a smoke damper.  
FIRE DOOR ASSEMBLY. Where openings occur in fire-resistance-rated assemblies, fire door  
assemblies are permitted as a method to protect the openings. Addressed in Section 716, fire  
door assemblies include not only the door but also the door frame, the door hardware, and any  
other components needed to provide the necessary fire-protective rating required for the specific  
application.  
FIRE PARTITION. A fire partition is a wall or similar vertical element that is utilized by the  
code to provide fire-resistive protection in limited applications. As a general rule, fire partitions  
are required to be of 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction and mandated for use in eight  
specified locations. The most common applications for fire partitions among those identified in  
Section 708 are for the construction of fire-resistance-rated corridors and for walls separating  
dwelling units in apartment buildings.  
FIRE-PROTECTION RATING. Opening protectives, such as fire door and fire window  
assemblies, are assigned a fire-protection rating in order to identify the time period in which the  
protective is expected to confine fire spread. The specific rating requirement, in either hours or  
minutes, varies based on the details of the fire-resistance-rated assembly in which the opening  
protective is located.  
FIRE-RATED GLAZING. Fire separation elements such as fire partitions, fire barriers and fire  
walls often include glazing in some forms, such as glazed wall assemblies, fire windows, and/or  
fire doors with vision panels. The definition of “fire-rated glazing” encompasses both types of  
such glazing addressed by the code, fire-resistance-rated glazing and fire-protection-rated  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationglazing. Fire-resistance-rated glazing, addressed in Sections 703.4 and 716.1.2.3, must be tested  
in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263 as a wall assembly. Fire-protection-rated glazing,  
established for use by Sections 716.2.5 and 716.3, is to be tested in accordance with NFPA 257  
or UL 9 as an opening protective. Both types of glazing are collectively referred to as fire-rated  
glazing.  
FIRE-RESISTANCE RATING. Identified by a specific time period, a fire-resistance rating is  
assigned to a tested component or assembly based on its ability to perform under fire conditions.  
A fire-resistance-rated component or assembly is intended to restrict the spread of fire from a  
specified area or provide the necessary protection for the continued performance of a structural  
member. This performance is based on fire resistance, defined as the property of materials or  
assemblies that prevents or retards the passage of excessive heat, hot gases, or flames.  
FIRE-RESISTANT JOINT SYSTEM. Where a linear opening is placed in or between adjacent  
fire-resistance-rated assemblies to allow independent movement of the assemblies, it is  
considered by the IBC as a joint. One or more joints may be provided to address movement  
caused by thermal, seismic, wind, or any other similar loading method. Designed to protect a  
potential breach in the integrity of a fire-resistance-rated horizontal or vertical assembly, a fire-  
resistant joint system is a tested assembly of specific materials designed to restrict the passage of  
fire through joints. The fire-resistance ratings required for the joint systems, as well as other  
requirements, are addressed in Section 715.  
FIRE SEPARATION DISTANCE. The fire separation distance describes the distance between  
the exterior surface of a building and one of three locations—the nearest interior lot line; the  
centerline of a street, alley, or other public way; or an imaginary line placed between two  
buildings on the same lot. The method of measurement is based on the distance as measured  
perpendicular to the face of the building. See Figure 202-10. The fire separation distance is  
important in the determination of exterior wall and opening protection based on a building’s  
location on the lot. See the discussion of Table 705.5 for a further analysis of this subject.  
FIRE WALL. Fully addressed in Section 706, one or more fire walls are building elements used  
to divide a single building into two or more separate buildings for the purpose of applying the  
allowable height, allowable area, type of construction, and control area requirements of the IBC.  
In addition, a fire wall is selectively identified in the code as a means to serve a variety of  
purposes where separate buildings are not created, including the use of horizontal exit separation  
as addressed in Section 1026.2. Starting at the foundation and continuing vertically to or through  
the roof, a fire wall is intended to fully restrict the spread of fire from one side of the wall to the  
other. Fire walls are higher level fire-resistance-rated elements than both fire barriers and fire  
partitions. Because the primary concept of fire walls is to create smaller buildings within one  
larger structure, with the code selectively regulating each small building individually rather than  
collectively, it is critical that a fire wall be capable of maintaining structural stability under fire  
conditions. If construction on either side of a fire wall should collapse, such a failure should not  
cause the fire wall to collapse for the prescribed time period of the rating of the wall.  
FIREBLOCKING. Fireblocking is mandated by the code to address the spread of fire through  
concealed spaces of combustible construction. Experience has shown that the greatest damage to  
conventional wood-frame buildings during a fire occurs when the fire travels unimpeded through  
concealed draft openings. Materials identified by the IBC as effective in resisting fire spread  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthrough concealed spaces include 2-inch \(51-mm\) nominal lumber, gypsum board, and glass-  
fiber batts.  
Figure 202-10 Fire separation distance.  
FLIGHT. The use of the term “flight” is specifically defined in order to establish its use within  
the code. The definition addresses two separate issues. First, a flight is made up of the treads and  
risers that occur between landings. As an example, a stairway connecting two stories that  
includes an intermediate landing consists of two flights. Second, the inclusion of winders within  
a stairway does not create multiple flights. Winders are simply treads within a flight and are  
often combined with rectangular treads within the same flight.  
FLOOR AREA, GROSS. As evidenced in Table 1004.5, the determination of the occupant load  
in the design of the means of egress system for most building uses is typically based on the gross  
floor area where fixed seating is not provided. This term describes the total floor area included  
within the surrounding exterior walls of a building, and the definition further states that the floor  
area of the building or portion thereof not provided with surrounding exterior walls shall be the  
usable area under the horizontal projection of the roof or floor above. The intent of this latter  
provision is to cover where a structure may not have exterior walls or may have one or more  
sides open without an enclosing exterior wall. Where buildings are composed of both enclosed  
and unenclosed areas, the gross floor area is typically determined as illustrated in Figure 202-11.  
Projections, such as eave overhangs, extending beyond an exterior wall or column line that are  
not intended to create usable space below are not to be considered in the determination of gross  
floor area. Areas often considered accessory-type spaces, such as closets, corridors, elevator  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationshafts, and stairways, must also be considered a part of the gross floor area, as are those areas,  
occupied by furniture, fixtures, and equipment.  
Figure 202-11 Gross floor area.  
FLOOR AREA, NET. The net floor area is considered the portion of the gross floor area that is  
typically occupied. Normally unoccupied accessory areas such as corridors, stairways, closets,  
toilet rooms, equipment rooms, and similar spaces are not to be included in the calculation of net  
floor area. In addition, the measurements are based on clear floor space, allowing for the  
deduction of building construction features such as interior walls and columns, as well as  
elevator shafts and plumbing chases. The use of net floor area in the calculation of design  
occupant load is typically permitted only in assembly and educational uses as set forth in Table  
1004.5\. It is important to note that in calculating net floor area, as well as gross floor area, the  
floor space occupied by furniture, fixtures, and equipment is not to be excluded in the  
calculation. Within an individual room or space, the floor area utilized for aisles and aisle  
accessways should also be included when calculating the net floor area. The floor-area-per-  
occupant factor established in Table 1004.5 includes any such anticipated furnishings and  
circulation paths in the establishment of an appropriate density estimate.  
FLOOR FIRE DOOR ASSEMBLY. Although a fire door is typically viewed as an element  
protecting an opening in a vertical building element such as a wall, it is possible that such doors  
can be effective if installed horizontally for the protection of an opening in a fire-resistance-rated  
floor. The floor fire door assembly, like other fire door assemblies, includes the door, frame,  
hardware, and other accessories that make up the assembly, and provides a specified level of fire  
protection for the opening.  
FOLDING AND TELESCOPING SEATING. Folding and telescoping seats are structures that  
provide tiered seating, which can be reduced in size and moved without dismantling. Utilized  
quite often in school gymnasiums, such seating presents the same concerns and risks as  
permanently installed bleacher seating when occupied. Such seating is regulated by ICC 300,  
Standard for Bleachers, Folding and Telescopic Seating, and Grandstands.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationGRADE PLANE. The code indicates that the grade plane is a reference plane representing the  
average of the finished ground level adjoining the building at its exterior walls. Under conditions  
where the finished ground level slopes significantly away from the exterior walls, that reference  
plane is established by the lowest points of elevation of the finished surface of the ground within  
an area between the building and lot line, or where the lot line is more than 6 feet \(1,829 mm\)  
from the building, between the building and a line 6 feet \(1,829 mm\) from the building. Where  
the slope away from the building is minimal \(typically provided only to drain water away from  
the exterior wall\), the elevation at the exterior wall provides an adequate reference point.  
The method for calculating grade plane can vary based on the site conditions. Where the slope  
is generally consistent as it passes across the building site, it may only require the averaging of a  
few points along the exterior wall of a rectangular-shaped building, as illustrated in Figure 202-  
12\. Where the slope is inconsistent or retaining walls are utilized, or where the building footprint  
is complex, the determination of grade plane can be more complicated. In such cases, a more  
exacting method for calculating the grade plane must be utilized. In addition, where fire walls are  
present, the elevation points should be taken at the intersections of the fire wall and the exterior  
walls.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-12 Grade plane calculation.  
This definition is extremely important in determining a building’s number of stories above  
grade plane as well as its height in feet. In some cases, the finished surface of the ground may be  
artificially raised with imported fill to create a higher grade plane around a building so as to  
decrease the number of stories above grade plane or height in feet. The code does not prohibit  
this practice, provided the building meets the code definition and restriction for height or number  
of stories above grade plane. See Figure 202-13.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-13 Use of built-up soil to raise finished grade.  
It is important to note that for the vast majority of buildings, it is not necessary to precisely  
calculate the grade plane. In such buildings, a general approximation of grade plane is sufficient  
to appropriately apply the code. A detailed calculation is only necessary in those limited  
situations where it is not obvious how the building is to be viewed in relationship to the  
surrounding ground level.  
GRANDSTAND. The definition of grandstand is also applicable to bleachers. Further  
information is provided in the discussion of the definition of bleachers. Grandstands are to be  
regulated by ICC 300, Standard for Bleachers, Folding and Telescopic Seating, and  
Grandstands.  
GUARD. A component or system of components whose function is the minimization of falls  
from an elevated area is considered a guard. Placed adjacent to the elevation change, a guard  
must be of adequate height, strength, and configuration to prevent someone from falling over or  
passing through the guard. Outside of the code, this element is more commonly referred to as a  
guardrail.  
HABITABLE SPACE. An area within a building, typically a residential occupancy, used for  
living, sleeping, eating, or cooking purposes would be considered habitable space. Those areas  
not considered to meet this definition include bathrooms, closets, hallways, laundry rooms,  
storage rooms, and utility spaces. Obviously, habitable spaces as defined in this section are those  
areas usually occupied, and as such are more highly regulated than their support areas. Although  
typical, it is not necessary that a room or area be finished in order to be considered habitable  
space. It is not uncommon for a dwelling unit to have a large basement that is not completely  
finished-out. Nevertheless, the basement may be used as living space, particularly for children  
who use it as a playroom. Such a basement would be considered habitable space, as the  
definition is simply based on the use of the room or area.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationHANDRAIL. Typically used in conjunction with a ramp or stairway, a handrail is intended to  
provide support for the user along the travel path. A handrail may also be used as a guide to  
direct the user in a specified direction.  
HEIGHT, BUILDING. Once the elevation of the grade plane has been calculated, it is possible  
to determine the building’s height. This height is measured vertically from the grade plane to the  
average height of the highest roof surface. Examples of this measurement are shown in Figure  
202-14.  
Figure 202-14 Height of building.  
Where the building is stepped or terraced, it is logical that its height is the maximum height of  
any segment of the building. It may be appropriate under certain circumstances that the number  
of stories in a building be determined in the same manner. Because of the varying requirements  
of the code that are related to the number of stories, such as means of egress, type of  
construction, and fire resistance of shaft enclosures, each case should be judged individually  
based on the characteristics of the site and construction. In addition to those factors better related  
to the number of stories, other items to consider are fire department access, location of exterior  
exit doors, routes of exit travel, and types of separation between segments.  
Figure 202-15 illustrates one example in which the height of the building and number of  
stories are determined for a stepped or terraced building. In the case of a stepped or terraced  
building, the language total perimeter is used to define the situation separating the first story  
above grade plane from a basement and is intended to include the entire perimeter of the segment  
of the building. Therefore, in the cross section of Figure 202-16, the total perimeter of the down-  
slope segment would be bounded by the retaining wall, the down-slope exterior wall, and the  
east and west exterior walls. In the case illustrated, the building has three stories above grade  
plane and no basement for the down-slope segment. The measurement for the maximum height  
of the building would be based on the maximum height of the down-slope segment.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-15 Terraced building.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-16 Three-story building.  
Similar to an unnecessarily detailed calculation of grade plane, there is seldom a need to  
precisely calculate the height of a building. Typically, a general determination of building height  
is adequate to ensure compliance with the code. For example, it is not necessary to go into great  
detail evaluating the average roof elevation of a built-up roof that has a low degree of slope for  
drainage purposes. The need for a more exacting determination of roof height is directly related  
to any uncertainty that may occur in reviewing for code compliance.  
HIGH-RISE BUILDING. A high-rise building has long been defined as a building having one  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationor more floor levels used for human occupancy located more than 75 feet \(22,860 mm\) above the  
lowest level of fire department vehicle access, as illustrated in Figure 202-17. Most moderately  
large and larger cities have apparatus that can fight fires up to about 75 feet \(22,860 mm\); thus,  
the fire can be fought from the exterior. Any fires above this height will require that they be  
fought internally. Also, in some circles, 75 feet \(22,860 mm\) is considered to be about the  
maximum height for a building that could be completely evacuated within a reasonable period of  
time. Thus, the fire department’s capability plus the time for evacuation of the occupants  
constitute the criteria used by the IBC for defining a high-rise building.  
Figure 202-17 Definition of high-rise building.  
The determining measurement is to be taken from the lowest point at which the fire  
department will locate their fire apparatus to the highest floor level that is viewed as occupiable.  
This would include a mezzanine floor level that may occur within the highest story, as well as an  
occupied roof \(such as a tennis court, swimming pool, or sun deck on the roof of a condominium  
building\).  
HORIZONTAL ASSEMBLY. A horizontal assembly is for the most part the horizontal  
equivalent of a fire barrier. It is utilized to restrict vertical fire spread through an established  
degree of fire resistance as mandated through various provisions in the IBC. The specifics for  
horizontal assemblies, which include both floor and roof assemblies, are found in Section 711.  
INTERIOR EXIT STAIRWAY. One of several exit components established in the code, an  
interior exit stairway provides a fire-resistance-rated enclosure for vertical egress in buildings.  
Section 1023 identifies the requirements for an interior exit stairway, including its construction  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand termination; permissible openings, penetrations, and ventilation; and necessary signage. One  
or more interior exit stairways are typically required in multistory buildings in order to satisfy  
the various means of egress requirements in Chapter 10.  
L RATING. An L rating is used in the evaluation of air leakage at penetrations and joints in  
smoke barriers. The IBC requires that penetrations and joints in those walls and floors that are  
intended to provide smoke separations be provided with a complying L rating as indicated in  
Sections 714.5.4 and 715.8.  
MASS TIMBER. Mass timber consists of Type IV structural elements that are primarily of  
solid, built-up, panelized, or engineered wood products that meet minimum Type IV cross-  
section dimensions. Mass timber represents both the large wood building elements historically  
recognized as heavy timber \(Type IV-HT\) construction and the three newly established  
construction types \(Types IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C\).  
MEANS OF EGRESS. The means of egress describes the entire travel path a person encounters  
under exiting conditions, beginning from any occupiable point in a building and not ending until  
the public way is reached. Often encompassing both horizontal and vertical travel, the means of  
egress should be direct, obvious, continuous, undiminished, and unobstructed. It includes all  
elements of the exiting system that might intervene between the most remote occupiable portion  
of the building and the eventual place of safety—typically the public way. Therefore, the means  
of egress includes all intervening components such as aisle accessways, aisles, doors, corridors,  
stairways, and egress courts, as well as any other component that might be in the path of travel,  
as depicted in Figure 202-18. There are three distinct and separate portions of a means of egress  
—the exit access, the exit, and the exit discharge.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-18 Means of egress.  
MEMBRANE PENETRATION. Similar to a through penetration in its performance  
requirements, a membrane penetration is an opening through only one membrane of a wall,  
floor/ceiling, or roof/ceiling assembly. An example of a very common membrane penetration is  
an electrical box.  
MEMBRANE-PENETRATION FIRESTOP. Where a penetrating item such as a pipe or  
conduit passes through a single membrane of a fire-resistance-rated wall, floor/ceiling, or  
roof/ceiling assembly, a membrane-penetration firestop may be required in order to adequately  
protect the penetration. Such a firestop consists of a device or construction that would effectively  
resist the passage of flame and heat through the opening in the membrane created by the  
penetrating item. A fire-resistance rating is assigned to a membrane-penetration firestop to  
indicate the time period for which the firestop is listed.  
MERCHANDISE PAD. Typically found in a mercantile use, a merchandise pad is created  
where racks, displays, shelving units, and similar fixtures are grouped into a specific area. Aisle  
accessways are provided within the merchandise pad to allow for customer circulation and are  
utilized as exit access elements. Such aisle accessways connect to the aisles that partially or  
entirely surround the merchandise pad. An example is shown in Figure 202-19.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-19 Merchandise pad.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-20 Building with two stories above grade plane and one basement level.  
MEZZANINE. A mezzanine is merely a code term for an intermediate floor level placed within  
a room between the floor and ceiling of a story. Typically limited in floor area to 33⅓ percent of  
the area of the room or space into which it is located, a mezzanine is regulated under the  
provisions of Section 505. A floor level fully complying with the provisions of Section 505 is  
permitted to be considered a mezzanine in order to utilize those special allowances applicable to  
such a condition. The use of the mezzanine provisions is a design option, as an elevated floor  
level complying with the scoping provisions of Section 505 is always permitted to be considered  
as an additional story rather than a mezzanine.  
OCCUPANT LOAD. Viewed as the basis for the design of the means of egress system, the  
occupant load is the number of persons considered for means of egress purposes both within and  
from any space, area, room, or building. Variations in code requirements are often caused based  
on the anticipated occupant load served by the specific building egress element. Although the  
establishment of an occupant load is critical in the application of many means of egress  
provisions located in Chapter 10, it is also often necessary when addressing minimum  
requirements for fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, and plumbing fixture counts. Section  
1004 establishes the appropriate methods for the determination of occupant loads.  
OCCUPIABLE SPACE. A number of provisions in the code apply only to those spaces, rooms,  
or areas typically occupied during the course of a building’s use. This definition clarifies that an  
occupiable space is intended for human occupancy, and as such is provided with means of  
egress, as well as light and ventilation facilities. Occasionally the code refers to the term  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationnormally occupied space. For example, Section 1023.4 limits openings in interior exit stairways  
to those necessary for exit access from normally occupied spaces. Although not defined in the  
code, these spaces are generally occupied for extended periods of time during the building’s use.  
There is an expectation that a fire or other hazardous condition would be quickly identified and  
addressed, rather than go unnoticed for an extended time. Examples of those spaces that would  
not be considered normally occupied include storage rooms, mechanical equipment rooms, and  
toilet rooms.  
PANIC HARDWARE. The term panic hardware describes an unlatching device that will  
operate even during panic situations, so that the force of individuals against the egress door will  
cause the door to unlatch without manual manipulation of the device.  
PENTHOUSE. Regulated by Section 1511.2, and further defined by Section 1511.2.2,  
penthouses are structures placed on the roofs of buildings to shelter various types of machinery  
and equipment, as well as stairway and vertical shaft openings. The definition clarifies that a  
penthouse is intended to be unoccupied. Rooftop structures, such as tanks, towers, spires, and  
domes, are not considered penthouses, but are regulated to some degree by other provisions in  
Section 1511.  
PLATFORM. The distinctions between the definitions of a stage and a platform are very  
important because of the requirements applicable to each element. A platform differs from a  
stage due to the lack of overhead hanging curtains, drops, scenery, and other effects that a stage  
contains. The amount of fire loading associated with a platform is typically much less than for a  
stage. Thus, the fire-severity potential is much lower. In order to be regulated as a platform, a  
raised performance area cannot have overhanging curtains; however, horizontal sliding curtains  
are permitted.  
PRIMARY STRUCTURAL FRAME. Any structural member or component that is essential to  
the vertical stability of the building under gravity loads is to be classified and protected as part of  
the primary structural frame. For the primary structural frame, the following components qualify\:  
• Columns  
• Beams and girder trusses—directly supported by columns  
• Roof and floor panels and slabs—monolithic concrete and timber construction  
• Braced frames and moment frames—transfer gravity loads to the foundation  
• Bearing walls—support gravity loads and transfer them to the foundation  
PRIVATE GARAGE. There are fundamentally two types of parking garages regulated by the  
IBC, private garages and public garages. There is no specific definition in the code for public  
garage, but Section 406.4 indicates that a public garage is any vehicle parking garage that does  
conform to the requirements for a private garage. Such public parking garages are further  
classified as either open parking garages or enclosed parking garages based upon specific  
characteristics.  
Private garages are limited to those facilities that comply with not only the definition criteria  
in this chapter, but also the limitations set forth in Section 406.3. A private garage, in addition to  
its restriction on floor area in Section 406.3.1, is also regulated as to its use. Motor vehicles  
stored in a private garage are limited to only those vehicles used by the owner and/or tenants of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe building or buildings on the same premises as the garage. In addition, the repair and/or  
serving of vehicles for business purposes cannot occur within a private garage.  
Although most private garages are associated with residential occupancies, there is no limit as  
to what occupancy classifications can be served by a private garage. For example, a small  
parking facility serving only those tenants in an office building could be considered as a private  
garage provided the requirements of Section 406.3 are met.  
PUBLIC WAY. The code defines a public way essentially as a street, alley, or any parcel of  
land that is permanently appropriated to the public for public use. Therefore, the public’s right to  
use such a parcel of land is guaranteed. The building occupants, having reached a public way, are  
literally free to go wherever they might choose. They are certainly free to go so far as to escape  
any fire threats in any building that they might have been occupying. There is an expectation that  
the public way be a continuation of the egress path, providing for continued exit travel away  
from the building until the necessary safety level has been achieved.  
RAMP. Where the slope of a travel path exceeds 1 unit vertical to 20 units horizontal \(1\:20\), it is  
considered a ramp. Where the travel path has a slope of 5 percent or less \(less than or equal to  
1\:20\), it is considered merely a walking surface.  
REPAIR GARAGE. Where a building, or portion of a building, is used for painting operations,  
body and fender work, engine overhauling, or other major repair of motor vehicles, it is  
considered to be a repair garage. Other activities included in the scope of those occurring in  
repair garages include service and maintenance work such as tire replacement, oil changes, and  
brake work. The designation as a repair garage is important in the occupancy classification of  
such activities as Group S-1.  
Where the work being performed falls outside of the scope of service or repair, such as  
vehicle detailing, window tinting, or the installation of audio or security components, its  
consideration as a repair garage may not be appropriate. The activities may be considered more  
of a business or sales use rather than that of repair or maintenance.  
SCISSOR STAIRWAY. A unique design element, the scissor stair allows for two independent  
paths of travel within a single interior exit stairway. A scissor stair is considered a single means  
of egress because the exit paths are not isolated from each other with the required level of fire  
resistance.  
SECONDARY STRUCTURAL MEMBERS. Secondary structural members are components  
that are built into an assembly that supports a portion of a floor or a roof, or only their own self-  
weight. The following members are considered as secondary\:  
• Roof trusses connected to a girder truss  
• Roof purlins and subpurlins connected to beams  
• Floor joists and trusses  
• Nonbearing walls  
• Bracing in the roof, floor, or walls that is specifically designed to resist wind or seismic  
loads and is redundant for gravity systems.  
SELF-CLOSING. In order to eliminate a portion of the human element in maintaining the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationintegrity of fire-resistance-rated wall assemblies, doors in such assemblies are typically required  
to be provided with self-closing devices that will ensure closing of the doors after having been  
opened. Occasionally, automatic-closing fire doors are installed in specific locations on account  
due to the nature of the situation. Under such conditions, the automatic-closing fire assemblies  
are to be regulated by NFPA 80.  
SHAFT. A shaft is considered the enclosed space that extends through one or more stories of a  
building. Its function is to connect vertical openings in successive floors that have been created  
to accommodate elevators, dumbwaiters, mechanical equipment, or similar devices, as well as  
for the transmission of natural light or ventilation air.  
SHAFT ENCLOSURE. A shaft enclosure is the building element defined by the boundaries of  
a shaft, which typically includes its surrounding walls and other forms of construction. Regulated  
by Section 713, it is required to be of fire-resistance-rated construction. A shaft enclosure is the  
most traditional application listed in Section 712.1 for addressing vertical openings in buildings.  
SLEEPING UNIT. The single required characteristic of a sleeping unit is that it is used as the  
primary location for sleeping purposes. The room or space that has sleeping facilities may also  
provide for eating and living activities. It could have a bathroom or a kitchen but not both, as this  
would qualify it as a dwelling unit. Guestrooms of Group R-1 hotels and motels would typically  
be considered sleeping units. Sleeping units are also commonly found in congregate living  
facilities, such as dormitories, sorority houses, and fraternity houses, and are regulated as Group  
R-2 occupancies.  
Group R occupancies are not the only types of uses where sleeping units are located. Several  
of the varied uses classified as Group I occupancies also contain resident or patient sleeping  
units. The proper designation of these spaces as sleeping units is important in the application of  
Section 420 mandating the separation of sleeping units in Group R and I-1 occupancies, as well  
as addressing the appropriate accessibility provisions of Chapter 11.  
SMOKE BARRIER. Required under various circumstances identified by the code, smoke  
barriers are either vertical or horizontal membranes, or a combination of both, intended to restrict  
the movement of smoke. Walls, floors, and ceiling assemblies may be considered smoke barriers  
where they are designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of Section 709.  
Smoke barriers are typically required where it is anticipated that building occupants will not be  
able to evacuate the building quickly under emergency conditions. Refuge areas created through  
the use of smoke barriers allow occupants to be isolated from fire and smoke conditions within  
the building until such time other action is required.  
SMOKE COMPARTMENT. Where smoke barriers totally enclose a portion of a building, the  
enclosed area is considered a smoke compartment. By completely isolating the compartment  
from the remainder of the building by interior walls, floors, and similar elements, smoke can be  
either contained within the originating area or prevented from entering other areas of the  
building. The use of smoke compartments is predominant in Group I-2 and I-3 occupancies.  
SMOKE DAMPER. Test standard UL 555S states that leakage-rated dampers \(smoke dampers  
in the terminology of the IBC\) are intended to restrict the spread of smoke in heating, ventilating,  
and air-conditioning \(HVAC\) systems that are designed to automatically shut down in the event  
of a fire, or to control the movement of smoke within a building when the HVAC system is  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationoperational in engineered smoke-control systems. The IBC simply identifies smoke dampers as  
listed devices designed to resist the passage of air and smoke through ducts and air-transfer  
openings. Smoke dampers must operate automatically unless manual control is desired from a  
remote command station.  
SMOKE-PROTECTED ASSEMBLY SEATING. Where the means of egress for assembly  
seating areas is designed to be relatively free of the accumulation of smoke, the seating is  
considered to be smoke protected. Protection may be achieved in one of the two ways, either  
through the design of a passive system or through ventilation by mechanical means. In order to  
qualify as smoke protected, the seating area and its exiting system must comply with the  
provisions of Section 1030.6.2, which addresses the methods of smoke control, the minimum  
roof height, and the possible installation of sprinklers in adjacent enclosed spaces. Exterior  
seating facilities such as stadiums or amphitheaters are commonly considered as open-air  
assembly seating due to the natural ventilation that is available. Where smoke-protected or open-  
air assembly seating is provided, selected means of egress requirements are modified recognizing  
the reduced potential for smoke accumulation in the seating area.  
STAIR. Where one or more risers are provided to address a change in elevation, a stair is  
created. A stair may simply be a slight change in height from one floor level to another,  
commonly referred to as a step, or may be a series of treads and risers connecting one floor level  
or landing to another. Also described in the code as a flight of stairs, a stair does not include the  
landings and floor levels that interrupt stairway travel.  
STAIRWAY. Where one or more flights of stairs occur, including any intermediate landings  
that connect the stair flights, a stairway is created. The term stairway describes the entire vertical  
travel element that is made up of stairs, landings, and platforms.  
STAIRWAY, SPIRAL. A spiral stairway is a stairway configuration where the treads radiate  
from a central pole. The treads are uniform in shape, with a tread length that varies significantly  
from the inside of the tread to the outside. The dimensional characteristics of a spiral stairway  
cause it to be limited in its application.  
STORY. Although seemingly quite obvious, the definition of a story is that portion of a building  
from a floor surface to the floor surface or roof above. In the case of the topmost story, the height  
of a story is measured from the floor surface to the top of the ceiling joists, or to the top of the  
roof rafters where a ceiling is not present. The critical part of the definition of a story involves  
the definition of story above grade plane.  
It is not uncommon for a roof level to be used for purposes other than weather protection or  
mechanical equipment. A roof patio, garden, or sports area is sometimes provided in order to  
utilize as much of the building as possible. Although an occupied roof does not meet the  
definition of “story,  
” there are certain provisions in the IBC that would be applicable due to the  
fact occupants can be present. For example, an occupied roof must be provided with a complying  
means of egress designed for the anticipated occupant load of the roof level. Full compliance  
with applicable accessibility requirements must also be provided. Required fire alarm system  
protection should be extended to such occupied roofs. However, the roof level would not be  
considered part of the building area for allowable area purposes. In addition, its consideration in  
the evaluation of a building’s allowable number of stories varies based upon the provisions of  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSection 503.1.4. A careful analysis should be made when determining which provisions are  
applicable to an occupied roof.  
Although stories are typically identified as above-ground floor levels, basements are also  
considered as stories. For example, a building with four stories above grade plane and one level  
of basement would be considered as a five-story building. The provisions specific to stories are  
typically addressing concerns within a building, while those related more toward stories above  
grade plane and basements are focused on exterior issues.  
STORY ABOVE GRADE PLANE. Throughout the code, the number of qualifying stories in a  
building is a contributing factor to the proper application of the provisions. As an example, a  
building’s allowable types of construction are based partly on the limits on height in stories  
placed on various occupancy groups. In this case, the code is limiting construction type based on  
the number of stories above grade plane. The code defines a story above grade plane as any story  
having its finished floor surface entirely above grade plane. However, floor levels partially below  
the grade at the building’s exterior may also fall under this terminology. The critical part of the  
definition involves whether or not a floor level located partially below grade is to be considered a  
story above grade plane. There are two additional criteria that are important to the determination  
if a given floor level is to be considered a story above grade plane\:  
1\. If the finished floor level above the level under consideration is more than 6 feet \(1,829  
mm\) above the grade plane as defined in Section 202, the level under consideration is a  
story above grade plane, or  
2\. If the finished floor level above the level under consideration is more than 12 feet \(3,658  
mm\) above the finished ground level at any point, the floor level under consideration shall  
be considered a story above grade plane.  
Where either one of these two conditions exists, the level under consideration is also  
considered a story above grade plane.  
Conversely, if the finished floor level above the level under consideration is 6 feet \(1,829  
mm\) or less above the grade plane, and does not exceed 12 feet \(3,658 mm\) at any point, the  
floor level under consideration is not considered a story above grade plane. By definition, it is  
regulated as a basement. Figures 202-20 and 202-21 illustrate the definitions of “story,  
”  
“basement,  
” and “story above grade plane.  
”  
Although the criteria for establishing the first story above grade plane in Item 2 indicates that  
such a condition occurs where the 12-foot \(3,658-mm\) limitation is exceeded, the application of  
this provision is not that simple. It is not the intent of the code to classify a story that is  
completely below grade except for a small entrance ramp or loading dock as a story above grade  
plane, provided there is no adverse effect on fire department access and staging. An analysis of  
the impact of such limited elevation differences is necessary to more appropriately apply the  
code’s intended result.  
T RATING. The T rating is defined as the time required for a specific temperature rise on the  
unexposed side of a penetration firestop system. More specifically, the penetration firestop  
system as well as the penetrating item must provide for a maximum increase in temperature of  
325°F \(163°C\) above its initial temperature for the time period reflected in the fire-resistance  
rating. The establishment of the rating of the through-penetration firestop is determined by tests  
in accordance with ASTM E814 or UL 1479. A more detailed discussion of the subject is found  
in Chapter 7.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTECHNICAL PRODUCTION AREA. Many auditoriums, arenas and performance halls, as  
well as other types of entertainment and sport venues, are provided with elevated technical  
support areas used for lighting, sound, scenery, and other performance effects. The code  
regulates these as technical production areas. The areas may or may not be associated with a  
stage, but are typically an integral part of the production. These spaces are generally limited in  
floor area, and access is always restricted to authorized personnel. The term “technical  
production areas” is intended to encompass all technical support areas, regardless of their  
traditional name. Special requirements for these types of areas are addressed in Section 410.  
THROUGH PENETRATION. A through penetration is considered an opening that passes  
through an entire assembly, accommodating various penetrating items such as cables, conduit,  
and piping. Where membrane construction is provided, such as gypsum board applied to both  
sides of a stud wall, a through penetration would pass entirely through both membranes and the  
cavity of the wall.  
THROUGH-PENETRATION FIRESTOP SYSTEM. In order to adequately protect the  
penetration of a fire-resistance-rated assembly by conduit, tubing, piping, and similar items, a  
through-penetration firestop system is sometimes required. Such a system may selectively  
include various materials or products that have been designed and tested to resist the spread of  
fire through the penetration. Through-penetration firestop systems are fire-resistance rated based  
on the criteria of ASTM E814 or UL 1479, and are provided with an hourly rating for both fire  
spread \(F rating\) and temperature rise \(T rating\).  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-21 Multistory building.  
WALKWAY, PEDESTRIAN. Described as a walkway used exclusively as a pedestrian  
trafficway, a pedestrian walkway provides a connection between buildings. A pedestrian  
walkway may be located at grade, as well as above ground level \(bridge\) or below grade  
\(tunnel\). The provisions addressing pedestrian walkways are optional in nature and utilized  
primarily to allow for the consideration of the connected buildings as separate structures.  
Regulations for pedestrian walkways and tunnels are found in Section 3104. An example of a  
pedestrian walkway is shown in Figure 202-22.  
WINDER. A winder, or winder tread, is a type of tread that is used to provide for a gradual  
change in direction of stairway travel. Although the total directional change created by winders is  
typically 90 degrees \(1.57 rad\), other configurations are also acceptable. Owing to a reduced  
level of safe stairway travel, winders may typically only be used as a required means of egress  
stairway when located within a dwelling unit.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 202-22 Pedestrian walkway.  
YARD. Used throughout the code to describe an open space at the exterior of a building, a yard  
must be unobstructed from the ground to the sky and located on the same lot on which the  
building is situated. A court, which is bounded on three or more sides by the exterior walls of the  
building, is not considered a yard. Both a yard and a court are expected to provide adequate  
openness and natural ventilation so that the accumulation of smoke and toxic gases will not  
occur.  
It is not intended that exterior areas devoted to parking, landscaping, or signage be prohibited  
to qualify as a yard, provided access to and from the building is available and maintained for  
both the occupants and fire department personnel. It is also important to recognize that the code  
provisions sometimes require a yard and at other times an open space, as well as references to  
fire separation distance. Although the differences may appear to be subtle, each term is applied  
somewhat differently.

Key Points  
This chapter of the code is simply an extension of Chapter 2 in that there are no technical  
requirements provided but rather descriptions of various uses and their assignment into  
specific classifications. These “occupancy” classifications are used as the basis for many of  
the provisions established elsewhere in the code. Potential uses are assigned an occupancy  
classification based on the specific occupant and content hazards that are anticipated to exist.  
Uses having similar hazard characteristics are all grouped into the same occupancy  
classification. Such characteristics may include the number, density, mobility, and awareness  
of the probable building occupants, as well as the combustibility, quantity, and environment of  
the building’s contents. Proper occupancy classification is a major factor in achieving the  
code’s intended purpose of establishing “minimum requirements to provide a reasonable level  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationof safety, health, and general welfare” as set forth in Section 101.3  
Section 302 Occupancy Classification and Use  
# Designation  
302.1 Occupancy classification. Every structure, or portion of a structure, must be classified  
with respect to its use by placing it into one of the 26 specific occupancy groups identified in the  
code. These groups are used throughout the International Building Code® \(IBC®\) to address  
everything from building size to fire-protection features. The occupancy groups are organized  
into 10 categories of a more general nature, representing the following types of uses\: assembly,  
business, educational, factory/industrial, high hazard, institutional, mercantile, residential,  
storage, and utility/miscellaneous.  
The provisions of Section 302.1 provide direction to\:  
1\. Classify all buildings into one or more of the 26 groups identified in the IBC.  
The occupancy classification is typically established by the design professional during the  
code analysis phase. Most of the time, the designer’s determination is consistent with that of the  
building department. However, where there is disagreement as to the proper classification of the  
various uses within the building, it is the building official’s responsibility to make the final  
decision. This authority is granted in Section 104.1 dealing with the interpretive powers of the  
building official. Although the IBC lists in some detail the uses allowed within a specific  
occupancy classification, the building official will at times also be called upon to judge whether  
or not a selected classification is appropriate under specific conditions. Assigning occupancy  
classification often depends not only on the use, but also on the extent and intensity of that use.  
The use may be so incidental to the overall occupancy that its effect on fire and life safety is  
negligible. As an example, the administrative office area in an elementary school performs a  
business-type function, but such a use is so incidental to the general operation and activities of  
the school that assigning it to a separate occupancy group would quite probably be unproductive.  
Therefore, the building official’s judgment will often be relied upon to classify occupancies that  
could potentially fall into more than one group.  
Several of the occupancy groups are further subdivided to more precisely recognize the  
difference in hazards that need to be addressed. Within the Group I-2 institutional group,  
Condition 1 occupancies consist primarily of nursing homes, while Condition 2 represents  
hospitals and similar facilities. Condition 1 and 2 classifications are assigned to Group I-1 and R-  
4 occupancies to better apply the necessary custodial care requirements based on whether or not  
the occupants require limited verbal or physical assistance. Along with other specific variations  
in application, it is apparent that there are, in fact, even more occupancy classifications than the  
26 initially established. It is intended that appropriate code requirements can be more accurately  
applied where even slight differences in hazard levels can be identified.  
Occupied roofs are to be assigned one or more occupancy classifications in a manner  
consistent with the classification of uses inside the building, based upon the fire and life safety  
hazards posed by the rooftop activities. The IBC is considered as an “occupancy-based” code,  
where the primary difference in requirements between buildings is due to the varying uses that  
are anticipated. As such, it is critical that an occupancy classification be assigned to any occupied  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationportion of a building in order that the appropriate fire and life safety criteria are applied. For  
example, where a rooftop contains a restaurant having dining seating for 50 or more persons, the  
occupied roof would be classified as a Group A-2 occupancy in order to address those hazards  
associated with such an assembly use.  
2\. Address any room or space within the building that will be occupied at different times for  
different purposes.  
Although an uncommon occurrence, a building space may at times be used for an activity that  
is considerably different from its typical use. It is important that the hazards associated with  
those different uses also be addressed. The code is basically asking that such a space be assigned  
multiple occupancy classifications, with the requirements of each assigned occupancy group to  
be applied. For practical purposes, the classification of the space should probably be based on the  
more restrictive of the occupancies involved. This would account for most of the requirements  
that would be in place. Any additional requirements that would be applicable because of the  
other occupancy classification would then be layered on top of the other provisions. Another  
method would be to establish the occupancy classification of the major use, which has the  
greatest occurrence, with a layering of the other occupancy requirements on top. Whatever the  
procedure, it is important that all anticipated uses, and the hazards these uses pose to the  
building’s occupants, be taken into account.  
A common example of a space used for various functions is a high school gymnasium. The  
space takes on various occupancy classifications based on the varied activities that occur,  
including Group E \(physical education classroom\), Group A-3 \(community activities\), Group A-  
4 \(spectator gymnasium\), and Group M \(weekend craft shows\). The classification of the space,  
which will result in the necessary safeguards being put in place, requires a comprehensive review  
of the anticipated activities and the hazards involved. A seasonal change in occupancy is another  
occurrence that must be considered. The creation of a haunted house for Halloween activities in  
a space typically used for other purposes is not uncommon. Regardless of the occupancy  
classification assigned, it is important that all of the anticipated uses be identified in order to  
apply the necessary code requirements.  
3\. Regulate buildings having two or more distinct occupancy classifications under the  
provisions of Section 508.  
Many buildings cannot simply be classified under a single designation. A hotel, considered a  
Group R-1 occupancy, typically includes assembly spaces classified as Group A. In addition,  
Group M and B occupancies may be present. Each distinct occupancy will be regulated based on  
the specific hazards that the individual uses create. The relationship between one occupancy and  
another is also very important. Where multiple occupancy conditions exist, the provisions of  
Section 508 are applicable.  
There are two basic approaches to assigning occupancy classifications where buildings have  
multiple uses. One approach is to evaluate the building as individual areas, assigning  
classifications specific to the use that is under evaluation. Once this process is complete, a re-  
evaluation should occur to determine which classifications can be revised to reflect that of the  
major use. The other option is to initially classify the building as a single occupancy. Then each  
anticipated use that cannot be adequately addressed under the major classification will be  
assigned its own classification. Whatever approach is used, the goal is to make sure that the code  
provisions that are intended to address the anticipated uses of the space, and their potential  
hazards, are put in place.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThere is an expectation that small support and circulation elements be included within the  
occupancy classification of the area in which they are located. This would include toilet rooms,  
storage closets, mechanical equipment rooms, and corridors. These spaces do not take on a  
unique classification unless they pose a unique hazard that can only be addressed with a different  
classification. A small reception area/office space of 360 square feet \(33.45 m2\) would most  
probably not be considered a Group B occupancy where it is a portion of a Group R-1 hotel. On  
the other hand, a 7,200-square-foot \(669-m2\) office/accounting/reservations center could hardly  
be considered as merely an extension of the Group R-1 classification. At some point, the use of a  
space and its relationship to other spaces in the building provide for a need to assign a separate  
classification.  
4\. Classify a use into the group that the occupancy most nearly resembles, based on life and  
fire hazard, when the use is not described specifically in the code.  
The code intends to divide the many uses possible in buildings and structures into 10 separate  
groupings where each group by itself represents similar hazards. The perils contemplated by the  
occupancy groupings are of the fire- and life-safety types and are broadly divided into two  
general categories\: those related to people and those related to property. The people-related  
hazards are divided further by activity, number of occupants, their ages, their capability of self-  
preservation, and the individual’s control over the conditions to which they subjected. The  
property-related hazards are divided further by the quantity of combustible, flammable, or  
explosive materials and whether such materials are in use or in storage.  
The uses to which a building may be put are obviously manifold, and as a result the building  
official will, on more than one occasion, either find or be presented with a use that will not  
conveniently fit into one of the occupancy classifications outlined in the code. As indicated  
previously in this commentary, under these circumstances, the IBC directs the building official to  
place the use in that classification delineated in the code that it most nearly resembles based on  
its life and fire risk. This requirement gives the building official broad authority to use judgment  
in the determination of the hazard of the affected group and, as a result of this evaluation,  
determine the occupancy classification that the hazards of the use most nearly resemble.  
Occasionally, there may be a question as to which classification is to be assigned to a specific  
use. The owner of a building and the building official may have a difference of opinion as to the  
proper occupancy classification, or the building official may face a use that appears to fit into  
one of the code-described groups, but after further analysis it is determined that the hazards  
representative of the code-defined group are not present in the use proposed. In such situations,  
the building official should use their authority to place the use in the occupancy classification  
that it most nearly resembles based on its life- and fire-hazard characteristics. It must be  
remembered that the purpose of occupancy classification is solely to have the ability to properly  
regulate for the hazards associated with the building’s expected use\(s\).  
Section 303 Assembly Group A  
The first item to be considered in this section is the description of an assembly occupancy as “the  
use of a building or structure, or portion thereof, for the gathering of persons for purposes such  
as civic, social or religious functions, recreation, food or drink consumption, or awaiting  
transportation.  
” The description of an assembly occupancy is further defined by the numerous  
examples of Group A uses listed in Section 303.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe concerns unique to assembly uses are based primarily on two factors\: the sizable  
occupant loads and the concentration of those occupant loads. Both conditions must exist to  
warrant a Group A classification. For example, a Group M big-box store has the potential for a  
large occupant load; however, the anticipated density of occupants within the store is not as  
concentrated as those densities are regulated under the Group A provisions. In order to be  
classified as a Group A occupancy, it is expected that the occupants are concentrated in a manner  
that will cause some inefficiency in egress under emergency conditions. Classification as an  
assembly use, and subsequently a Group A occupancy, requires that the occupants be present in a  
density that poses unique hazards due to the high concentration of people.  
Assembly uses are further divided based on other factors unique to the activities that take  
place. A review of the uses specifically listed as Group A occupancies indicates that although  
some are general in nature, such as libraries and arenas, others are specific to a room or area  
within a building \(courtroom, lecture hall, and waiting areas in transportation terminals\). This  
concept of identifying uses is not limited to Group A occupancies, but rather is consistent  
throughout all of the occupancy group descriptions. It is critical that the building official  
thoroughly evaluate the uses that are anticipated and assign occupancy classifications based on  
the hazards that have been identified.  
303.1.1 Small buildings and tenant spaces. Classification of a small assembly building or  
tenant space housing limited occupants as a Group A occupancy is considered unnecessary due  
to the limited hazards that are expected to be present. An assembly use with an occupant load of  
fewer than 50 persons and not accessory to another use, such as a small free-standing chapel or a  
café located in a strip shopping center, is to be classified as Group B. As a result, a Group A  
occupancy classification is typically only assigned to a stand-alone assembly use containing at  
least 50 occupants.  
Where a Group B café or similar establishment has an associated kitchen, the kitchen is also  
to be classified as a portion of the Group B occupancy. This approach is consistent with the  
classification of commercial kitchens associated with Group A-2 dining facilities as indicated in  
Section 303.3.  
In the calculation of occupant load for a café or similar establishment with customer seating,  
only the occupant load of the seating area should be considered when determining the occupancy  
classification. For example, a café with 48 occupants in the dining area and four occupants in the  
kitchen area would be classified as a Group B occupancy. This methodology is based upon the  
recognition that less than 50 occupants are in an assembly condition.  
303.1.2 Small assembly spaces. Where the area used for assembly purposes is accessory to  
another occupancy in the building and contains an occupant load of fewer than 50 persons, the  
room or space can merely be considered an extension of the other occupancy. As an example, a  
break room with an occupant load of 30 in a large manufacturing facility could simply be  
considered a portion of the Group F occupancy. See Figure 303-1. As an option to the designer, a  
Group B classification can be assigned to the break room.  
These two classification options are also available where the occupant load exceeds 49 but the  
floor area does not exceed 749 square feet \(70 m2\). For example, a 715-square-foot \(66.4 m2\)  
casino gaming area in a Group M retail sales establishment could be classified as Group B or a  
portion of the Group M even though the occupant load of the gaming area would be 65.  
Another example as shown in Figure 303-2 illustrates how a small accessory assembly space  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwith an occupant load of 50 or more need not be classified as a Group A occupancy. In the  
example, a small 480-square-foot \(44-m2\) chapel, having an occupant load of 68 and located  
within an assisted living facility classified as a Group I-1 occupancy, can simply be classified as  
an extension of the Group I-1 classification. As a design alternative, a classification of Group B  
is also permitted to be assigned to the chapel.  
Figure 303-1 Accessory space classification.  
Figure 303-2 Group I-1 classification.  
303.1.3 Associated with Group E occupancies. The classification of those assembly areas  
associated with a Group E occupancy as part of the Group E is permitted; however, the  
application of the Group E classification for the entire educational facility is based on the  
assembly areas being subsidiary to the school function. This would seem to indicate that the  
users of the associated assembly spaces are limited to students, teachers, relatives of students,  
administrators, and others directly involved in educational activities. A typical example of an  
associated assembly space is a library or media center that is used almost exclusively by students  
of the school. On the other hand, gymnasiums and auditoriums located in high school buildings  
are often used for community functions and other outside activities such as sports tournaments,  
craft shows, and community theater productions that have no relationship to normal educational  
uses. In such cases, a classification of Group A is often viewed as more appropriate based on  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthese unrelated uses. It is up to the building official to identify the various activities intended for  
these assembly spaces and apply the proper occupancy classification based upon the potential  
hazards due to such activities. See the discussion of Section 302.1 regarding rooms or spaces  
intended to be occupied at different times for different purposes. Even in those situations where a  
Group E classification is appropriate for associated assembly uses, it is important that the  
assembly accessibility provisions of Chapter 11 be applied. In addition, the assembly means of  
egress provisions set forth in Section 1030 should also be used in designing the means of egress  
system for the assembly areas, regardless of occupancy classification.  
303.1.4 Accessory to places of religious worship. Small and moderately sized educational  
rooms and auditoriums accessory to places of religious worship are permitted to be classified as  
a portion of the major occupancy rather than individually. This would result in their  
classification as part of the overall Group A-3 occupancy. The allowance is simply a design  
option that can be used to eliminate or reduce any potential mixed occupancy conditions. If the  
designer wishes to classify such spaces individually, such as using a Group E occupancy  
classification for any religious educational rooms, such a classification is also permissible.  
303.2 Assembly Group A-1. A factor involving human behavior in theaters classified as Group  
A-1 assembly rooms is the fact that in many cases the occupants are not familiar with their  
surroundings and the lighting level is usually low. Thus, when an emergency arises, the  
occupants may perceive the danger to be greater than presented, and panic may occur because of  
the fear of not being able to reach an exit for escape. In addition, the concentration of occupants  
in such uses is quite dense. The presence of a stage and its distinctive hazards that occur in some  
Group A-1 occupancies cause unique concerns, addressed by the special provisions of Section  
410\. Although not required for classification as a Group A-1, the presence of fixed seating is  
common in such occupancies. Similar multipurpose spaces where seating is not permanent are  
typically classified as Group A-3 occupancies due to the potential for other types of assembly  
activities.  
303.3 Assembly Group A-2. Group A-2 occupancies include uses primarily intended for the  
consumption of food or drink, and include dining rooms, cafeterias, restaurants, cafes,  
nightclubs, taverns, and bars. The fire record in occupancies of this type is not very good, based  
in part on the delay in occupant response to a fire or other emergency incident. Because of the  
common presence of loose tables and chairs, aisles are often difficult to maintain, resulting in  
obstructions to egress travel. Overcrowding conditions, low-lighting levels, and the consumption  
of alcoholic beverages also increase the risks associated with many of these types of  
occupancies. The gaming floor areas of casinos are also classified as Group A-2 based in great  
part due to the congestion and distractions often encountered.  
Included in the uses classified as Group A-2 occupancies are those commercial kitchens  
directly associated with Group A-2 restaurants, cafeterias, and similar dining facilities. Although  
a commercial kitchen does not pose the same types of hazards as an assembly use, the allowance  
for a similar classification has traditionally been viewed as appropriate.  
Where the primary function of an assembly space or building is not food or drink  
consumption, but drinking and dining activities do occur and so it is not always appropriate to  
assign a Group A-2 classification. For example, an arena or stadium used for sports events and  
concerts typically contains eating and drinking as a part of the available activities. And yet, such  
buildings would be classified as Group A-4 and A-5 occupancies, respectively, due to their  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprimary usage being sporting events with spectator seating. Classification as a Group A-2  
occupancy should be limited to those situations where the primary use and expected hazards are  
related to food and drink consumption.  
303.4 Assembly Group A-3. Occupancies classified as Group A-3 have varying degrees of  
occupant density, numerous types and numbers of furnishings and equipment, and fire loading  
that can vary from low to high. The hazards for uses in this category are similar to most of those  
found in Group A-1 and A-2 occupancies. Where a use does not conveniently fit into one of the  
other four Group A classifications, a Group A-3 designation is typically appropriate. The  
classification of an assembly occupancy as a Group A-3 is also common where varying assembly  
uses are likely to occur at different times within the same space. For example, a meeting room at  
a hotel is typically used at differing times for various functions, including seminar presentations,  
dining activities, trade shows, and wedding receptions. Although these functions may have  
different Group A designations when viewed individually, as a group they pose a hazard level  
that can be appropriately addressed with the Group A-3 classification. Therefore, most  
multipurpose rooms are simply classified as Group A-3 occupancies.  
The mere presence of recreational activities does not necessarily warrant the classification of  
a building or space as a Group A-3 occupancy. Rather, it is the concentration of occupants  
participating or viewing the activity that should be used to determine the appropriate  
classification. The example illustrated in Figure 303-3 is based on a golf instruction academy  
with various “stations” at which students work on their skills individually or with an instructor.  
Support facilities such as restrooms, locker rooms, merchandise sales, and a snack bar are also  
provided. Although the occupant load of the building exceeds 49, there is little or no  
concentration of the occupants in a single area. Therefore, classification as Group A occupancy  
would not be warranted. A more appropriate classification of Group B would better describe the  
hazards and conditions found within a use of this type.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 303-3 Group B Golf Institute Academy.  
303.5 Assembly Group A-4. The combination of spectator seating and sporting events creates a  
condition within a building that warrants a specific occupancy classification within the Group A  
classification. A Group A-4 facility contains those occupant-related hazards found in other  
assembly occupancies, namely high occupant loads in concentrated areas, along with large areas  
having limited occupants and little, if any, fire loading conditions. The focus of the Group A-4  
designation is that there is a significant number of spectators present in a relatively concentrated  
environment.  
303.6 Assembly Group A-5. Uses classified as Group A-5 are similar in nature to Group A-4  
occupancies, with the controlling difference being that Group A-5 occupancies are structures  
related to outdoor activities. Therefore, the fire hazard for Group A-5 occupancies is typically  
less than that for those classified as Group A-4 occupancies, and significantly lower than the  
other assembly Group A occupancies. The controlling expectation recognizes there will be little  
to no smoke accumulation under fire conditions in the assembly areas of a Group A-5  
occupancy. However, there still exist the hazards of crowding a large number of occupants  
within a relatively small space. The hazard of panic is assumed to be a large portion of the  
overall concern for Group A-5 structures. Generally, associated spaces such as concession  
stands, locker rooms, storage areas, press boxes, and toilet rooms are included as a portion of the  
Group A-5 classification. However, where uses within the building create conditions more  
hazardous than anticipated by the Group A-5 designation, such uses must be classified according  
to their individual characteristics. For example, an enclosed 400-seat restaurant within an open-  
air sports stadium should be appropriately classified as a Group A-2 occupancy. With all things  
considered, the primary consideration in classifying a use as Group A-5 is the lack of smoke  
accumulation. Where there is doubt as to the openness of the assembly seating area, an analysis  
must be undertaken to determine whether a Group A-5 classification is appropriate.  
Section 304 Business Group B  
The most common use classified as a Group B occupancy is an office building, or a portion of a  
building containing office tenants or office suites. Those areas of such business occupancies  
where records and accounts are stored are also considered part of the Group B classification.  
Examples of uses involving office, professional, or service-type transactions are listed in the  
code. Group B occupancies are among the least regulated uses in the IBC due to the limited  
hazards presented. Low to moderate occupant loads and fire loading, along with the typical  
presence of ambulatory occupants, create environments that do not require a significant amount  
of fire- and life-safety regulation.  
Airport traffic control towers are considered Group B occupancies and are regulated under the  
special-use provisions of Section 412.2. Car wash structures and motor vehicle showrooms are  
also considered business occupancies. Since a car wash facility or vehicle showroom contains a  
limited number of vehicles that are present in a very controlled condition, it is anticipated that the  
fire risk is limited, and classification as a Group B occupancy is appropriate.  
Medical offices, including both outpatient clinics and ambulatory care facilities, are classified  
as Group B occupancies. By definition, an outpatient clinic is not expected to serve patients who  
will be temporarily rendered incapable of self-preservation due to their treatment. On the other  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationhand, an ambulatory care facility is expected to have one or more individuals present who are  
temporarily rendered incapable of self-preservation due to the application of nerve blocks,  
sedation, or anesthesia. Such facilities may also include individuals who are already incapable of  
self-preservation upon arrival. Although both types of facilities would be classified as Group B  
occupancies, the unique concerns applicable to ambulatory care facilities are further addressed in  
the special provisions of Section 422. Several fire- and life-safety requirements applicable to  
ambulatory care facilities are not mandated for other types of Group B occupancies.  
Educational occupancies above the 12th grade, including college classrooms and training  
rooms for adult education, are considered Group B occupancies. This designation is not specified  
as incumbent on the number of students \(occupants\) in the room; however, a lecture hall is  
specifically listed in Section 303.4 as a Group A-3 occupancy. Therefore, it should be assumed  
that a college classroom having an occupant load of 50 or more is to be classified as Group A-3  
rather than Group B. The hazards associated with a large classroom are consistent with those for  
other assembly spaces and should be regulated accordingly. Recognition of educational  
occupancies serving students above the 12th grade is deemed necessary so as to differentiate  
from educational uses serving lower grade levels classified as Group E. Where the Group B  
higher education facilities include laboratories used for testing, analysis, research, teaching, or  
development activities, such laboratories would be considered as an extension of the Group B  
classification if in compliance with Section 428.  
Food processing establishments and commercial kitchens of limited size are considered as  
Group B occupancies in those cases where they do not serve dining facilities. Small catering  
operations, bakeries, and similar facilities are viewed as limited in hazard level where they do not  
exceed 2,500 square feet \(232 m2\) in floor area. More commonly, the Group B classification is  
applied to small retail food and beverage uses where cooking activities occur and the public is  
present for a limited time period, but no dining area is provided, such as a pizza carry-out  
business. These small, quick-transaction food sales tenants do not pose concerns to the degree of  
restaurants or large food processing operations; therefore, a classification of Group B is  
considered appropriate where the floor area is limited in size.  
Where not exceeding the maximum quantities of hazardous materials allowed by the code in  
Section 307, testing and research laboratories may be considered Group B occupancies. Where  
the allowable quantities are exceeded, such laboratories would be classified as Group H. A  
review of Section 428 is necessary for laboratories located in university and college buildings.  
The Group B classification of training and skill development programs outside of a school or  
academic program includes uses such as tutoring programs and instrumental music training.  
Where the occupant load and concentration of occupants is such that an assembly use is created,  
a classification of Group A is typically required where an occupant load of 50 or more is  
established. Although it is specified that there are no occupant age criteria associated with  
classification as a Group B occupancy, it may be necessary to apply a higher level classification  
where the hazards anticipated based on the specific use fall outside of those typically  
encountered within a Group B occupancy. For example, skill development activities conducted  
for infants or toddlers should more appropriately be considered as a Group E or I-4 occupancy if  
the potential hazard level is consistent with that of a day-care facility. As with any occupancy  
designation, the intent of the classification is to be able to correctly apply the appropriate  
minimum standards of health, safety, and public welfare.  
Classification of a space or building as Group B is also addressed in Sections 303.1.1 and  
303.1.2\. Assembly buildings and tenant spaces with occupant loads of less than 50 are to be  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconsidered as Group B occupancies. In addition, those assembly spaces accessory to other  
occupancies may also be considered as Group B where the occupant load does not exceed 50 or  
the floor area is less than 750 square feet \(70 m2\). Although the use of such buildings and spaces  
is assembly in nature, the reduced hazard due to the limited occupant load or floor area allows  
for a classification as Group B.  
Section 305 Educational Group E  
The Group E classification is assigned to schools, including primary, middle, and high schools,  
as well as day-care facilities. All Group E occupancies have three features in common\: they are  
limited to the education, supervision, or personal care of persons at an educational level no  
higher than the 12th grade; the occupants are only in the facility for a limited time each day; and  
there are at least six persons being educated, supervised, or cared for at the same time.  
305.1Educational Group E. The classification of school classrooms as Group E occupancies is  
typically a straightforward decision. It is also common to classify the administrative offices  
within a school building as an extension of the Group E function. Even the media center and  
lunchroom are generally viewed as just additional areas of the Group E occupancy, but what  
about other assembly spaces such as the gymnasium and auditorium? There is a unique feature  
involved in educational occupancies—the use of school buildings for assembly purposes outside  
the scope of the educational use. For example, many school auditoriums are used for community  
theater and other productions to which the public at large is invited. Also, the school gymnasium  
in many cases is used for neighborhood recreation activities or sporting events where all ages of  
occupants are present. It is not uncommon for school auditoriums and gymnasiums to be rented  
out to groups for special functions. When these additional uses are anticipated, there is adequate  
reason that they be classified as Group A occupancies. Therefore, on account of these  
multipurpose uses in many school buildings, it is necessary that the code requirements applicable  
to all expected uses be enforced in order to satisfy the safety requirements for each use. See the  
additional discussion of Section 303.1.3 on multipurpose areas within educational facilities.  
305.1.1 Accessory to places of religious worship. It is common in buildings of religious  
worship that support spaces are provided in addition to the main worship hall. Such spaces  
typically include rooms for educational activities for persons of all ages, including children. Such  
educational areas are permitted to be classified as an extension of the Group A-3 worship hall  
rather than Group E, thus eliminating a mixed-occupancy condition. The limitation of the  
provision to rooms and auditoriums with occupant loads of less than 100 has limited, if any,  
application, as larger assembly spaces would typically be considered Group A-3 occupancies as  
well. This allowance is also addressed in Section 303.1.4.  
305.2 Group E day-care facilities. Day-care facilities considered as Group E occupancies are  
limited to those facilities where children are provided with educational, supervision, or personal  
care services for periods of less than 24 hours per day. It is anticipated that the children will be  
able to egress efficiently with limited assistance from staff. Facilities that provide custodial care  
services in a day-care environment are more appropriately assigned a Group I-4 classification. In  
addition, full-time care facilities cannot be considered Group E occupancies. The number of  
children housed in a day-care operation classified as Group E is not limited; however, where the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationnumber of children is five or fewer, the use is to be classified as part of the primary occupancy.  
The provisions of Section 305.2 only address care facilities for children over the age of 2½  
years. However, the Group E classification is also applicable to facilities that provide  
infant/toddler care \(2½ years of age or younger\) where the conditions established in Section  
308.5.1 are met. In such cases, the rooms housing the infants and/or toddlers must be located on  
the level of exit discharge, and each of such rooms must have an exit door directly to the exterior  
of the building. See Figure 305-1.  
Figure 305-1 Group E classification.  
305.2.1 Within places of religious worship. It is common for child care to be available at places  
of religious worship during worship services and other activities. Nurseries,  
“cry rooms,  
” and  
other child care spaces are often occupied during the same limited time period as the other  
activities within the worship facility. The occupancy classification of such spaces is permitted to  
be consistent with that of the main occupancy so that a mixed-occupancy condition need not be  
created. Although this allowance is limited to only those child care facilities where the children  
are older than 2½ years of age, a similar allowance for facilities caring for younger children and  
adults is found in Section 308.5.2.  
305.2.2 Five or fewer children. Where five or fewer children are receiving day care within a  
building housing another use that can be considered the primary occupancy, the day-care  
operation is simply to be considered a portion of that occupancy. For example, a small day-care  
activity within an office environment would be classified as a portion of the Group B office use.  
Where there is no use in the building other than a day-care facility serving five or fewer children,  
it is assumed that a Group R-3 classification is to be applied. One of the listed Group R-3  
occupancies in Section 310.4 is “care facilities that provide accommodations for five or fewer  
persons receiving care.  
”  
305.2.3 Five or fewer children in a dwelling unit. Where care is being provided to no more  
than five children and such care occurs within a dwelling unit, the occupancy classification of the  
dwelling unit is not to be modified due to the presence of the child care activities. For example,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationchild care for five or fewer children in a dwelling unit complying with the scope of the  
International Residential Code® \(IRC®\) is permitted with no additional requirements applicable  
to the day-care operation. An occupancy classification of Group R-2 would continue to be  
appropriate for such child care activities in a dwelling unit classified as a Group R-2 occupancy.  
Although the code text specifically calls out classification as a Group R-3 occupancy, it would be  
more appropriate to maintain the same classification as the other dwelling units within the  
building. It is intended that the presence of a child care use in a dwelling unit where the number  
of children receiving care does not exceed five will have no effect on the occupancy  
classification determination or the applicable code that is to be enforced.  
Section 306 Factory Group F  
Although the potential hazard and fire severity of the multiple uses in the Group F occupancy  
classification is quite varied, these uses share common elements. The occupants are adults who  
are awake and generally have enough familiarity with the premises to be able to exit the building  
with reasonable efficiency. Public occupancy is usually quite limited, if at all, and most  
occupants are aware of the potential hazards the use creates. Group F occupancies are generally  
regarded as factory and industrial uses. The degree of hazard between the uses is very broad, and  
therefore the occupancy is divided into two categories.  
Many manufacturing and industrial uses contain some degree of hazardous material as a  
necessary part of the manufacturing process. However, where the amount of hazardous material  
does not exceed the maximum allowable quantities set forth in Table 307.1\(1\) or 307.1\(2\), a  
classification as Group H is not appropriate. Because of the similarity between the different types  
of uses in Group F-1 occupancies and those in Group H occupancies, care must be exercised  
when determining the appropriate classification, and operators of Group F-1 occupancies should  
be apprised of the limitations on the quantities of hazardous materials that are allowed.  
Some of the activities specifically listed as Group F occupancies also occur in a limited sense  
as accessory functions, and as such are not to be classified as Group F. For example, food  
processing is identified as a Group F-1 occupancy, but this is not to say that a kitchen serving a  
restaurant or cafe should be classified as such. Kitchens are considered to be classified as a  
portion of the major occupancy that they serve, typically either a Group A or a Group B  
occupancy. The food processing operations designated as Group F-1 occupancies primarily  
include factories that produce canned or packaged items in bulk, as well as commercial kitchens  
that support catering operations or similar activities. Smaller facilities, those under 2,500 square  
feet \(232 m2\), are to be classified as Group B as addressed in the discussion of Section 304.1.  
The hazard from uses in Group F-2 occupancies is very low; in fact, the activities are deemed  
as among the lowest hazard groups in the code. It is assumed that the fabrication or  
manufacturing of noncombustible materials will pose little, if any, fire risk to the building or its  
occupants. Foundries would be considered Group F-2 occupancies, as would facilities used for  
steel fabrication or assembly. Manufacturing operations producing ceramic, glass, or gypsum  
products are also included in this classification. Although very high temperatures are critical to  
the processes and operations of these types of uses, such heat is controlled and not a concern due  
to any combustibles or other fire loading that may be present.  
Section 307 High-Hazard Group H  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationHigh-hazard Group H occupancies are characterized by an unusually high degree of explosion,  
fire, or health hazard as compared to typical commercial and industrial uses. The identification of  
hazardous occupancies is provided in this section.  
There is one common feature about Group H occupancies—they are designated as Group H  
based on excessive quantities of hazardous materials contained therein. Where the quantities of  
hazardous material stored or used in a building exceed those set forth in Section 307, a Group H  
classification is warranted. On the other hand, where such quantities are not exceeded, a Group H  
classification is not appropriate.  
Because of the technical nature of the operations and materials found in Group H  
occupancies, a number of specific terms are defined by the IBC in Chapter 2. The definitions are  
intended to assist the code user in applying the provisions of this chapter, as well as other  
portions of the code relating to high-hazard uses.  
Group H-1 occupancies are those buildings containing high-explosion hazard materials.  
Materials that have the potential for detonation must be housed in buildings regulated in a very  
special manner, and designed and constructed unlike any other occupancies described in the  
code. Examples of detonable materials include explosives and Class 4 oxidizers.  
Group H-2 generally includes those occupancies that contain materials with hazards of  
accelerated burning or moderate explosion potential, including materials with deflagration  
hazards. Common occupancies included in this category are those operations where flammable  
or combustible liquids are being used, mixed, or dispensed. The potential for a hazardous  
incident is increased because of the materials’ exposure to the surrounding area. Occupancies  
containing combustible dusts may also be considered as Group H-2, as dusts in suspension, or  
capable of being put into suspension, in the atmosphere are a deflagration hazard. In the  
determination of occupancy classification for a facility where combustible dusts are anticipated,  
a technical report and opinion must be provided to the building official that provides all  
necessary information for a qualified decision as to the potential hazards due to the combustible  
dusts.  
Buildings containing materials that present high-fire or heat-release hazards are classified as  
Group H-3 occupancies. Where flammable or combustible liquids are present in such  
occupancies, they must be stored in normally closed containers or used in low-pressure systems.  
Because of the enclosed nature of these liquids, the hazard level is not nearly as severe as it is for  
Group H-2 occupancies. Other hazardous materials such as organic peroxides and oxidizers,  
based on their hazard classification, may also be used or stored in Group H-3 occupancies.  
Group H-4 occupancies are those containing health-hazard materials such as corrosives and  
toxics. Section 202 defines “Health hazards” as those “chemicals for which there is statistical  
significant evidence that acute or chronic health effects are capable of occurring in exposed  
persons.  
” Quite often, a material considered a health hazard also possesses the characteristics of  
a physical hazard. It is important that all hazards of materials be addressed.  
Occupancies classified as Group H-5 are those uses containing semiconductor fabrication  
activities, including the ancillary research and development areas. The Group H-5 category was  
created in order to address the explosive and highly toxic materials used in semiconductor  
fabrication by providing specific requirements for the particular operations conducted, while at  
the same time providing a level that allows reasonable transaction of the fabrication process.  
A more complete commentary on hazardous materials is provided under the discussion of  
Section 414.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation307.1 High-Hazard Group H. The concept of maximum allowable quantities of hazardous  
materials as the basis for occupancy classification is further extended through the use of control  
areas as regulated by Section 414.2.  
Maximum allowable quantities. Occupancy classifications of buildings containing hazardous  
materials are based on the maximum allowable quantities concept. Tables 307.1\(1\) and 307.1\(2\),  
together with their appropriate footnotes, identify the maximum amounts of hazardous materials  
that may be stored or used in a control area before the area must be designated as a Group H  
occupancy. The maximum quantities of hazardous materials permitted in non–Group H  
occupancies vary for different states of materials \(solid, liquid, or gas\) and for different situations  
\(storage or use\). The allowable quantities are also varied based on protection that is provided,  
such as automatic sprinkler systems and storage cabinets.  
Control areas. Areas in a building that contain hazardous materials in amounts that do not  
exceed the maximum allowable quantities and that are properly separated from other areas  
containing hazardous materials are called control areas. Any combination of hazardous  
materials, up to the maximum allowable quantities, is permitted in a control area. A control area  
may be an entire building or only a portion of the building. It can be part of a story, an entire  
story, or even include multiple stories. A control area is classified, based on it use, as other than  
Group H as its sole purpose is to avoid a Group H classification.  
The control-area method is based on the concept of fire-resistance-rated compartmentation. It  
regulates quantities of hazardous materials per compartment \(control area\), rather than per  
building. The limit for the entire building, using control areas, is then established by limiting the  
total number of control areas allowed per story and the quantities of hazardous materials that are  
located in each control area. The control-area concept was introduced in an effort to regulate  
buildings of different sizes in a consistent manner. It is based on a premise that the storage and  
use of limited quantities of hazardous materials \(not exceeding maximum allowable quantities\)  
in areas that are separated from each other by fire-resistance-rated separations do not  
substantially increase the risk to the occupants or change the character of the building to that of a  
hazardous occupancy, subject to a limitation on the number of control areas. The fire-resistive  
separations are relied on to minimize the risk of having multiple control areas involved  
simultaneously during an emergency.  
There is no special occupancy designation for a control area. For example, a control area in a  
manufacturing occupancy is merely part of the Group F occupancy. Further discussion of control  
areas is addressed in the commentary of Section 414.2. In addition, the use of laboratory suites in  
college and university laboratory settings as discussed in Section 428 is based on the control area  
concept.  
Increased quantities. Given this basic understanding of maximum allowable quantities and  
control areas, the various options in the code for increasing the quantities of hazardous materials  
within a building are as follows\:  
1\. Buildings are generally allowed to have up to the basic maximum allowable quantities of  
hazardous materials without restriction with respect to separations or protection. In this  
case, the entire building is designated as a control area. The boundaries of the control area  
are the boundaries of the building \(i.e., exterior walls, roof, and foundation\). See Figure  
307-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 307-1 Control area boundaries for one control area  
2\. Using the footnotes to Tables 307.1\(1\) and 307.1\(2\), the maximum allowable quantities  
can often be increased by providing automatic sprinkler protection throughout the  
building and/or by using approved storage cabinets, safety cans, or other code-approved  
enclosures to protect the hazardous materials. It is important that the increases identified  
in the footnotes only be used where applicable.  
3\. Four other options are available to further increase the quantities of hazardous materials in  
any building\:  
3.1\. Provide additional control areas as limited by Table 414.2.2,  
3.2\. Provide one or more fire walls in conformance with Section 706,  
3.3 Apply the allowances for unlimited quantities in Section 307.1.1, or  
3.4 Construct the building as required for a Group H occupancy.  
Assuming additional control areas are used, each additional control area must be separated  
from all other control areas by minimum 1-hour fire barriers, or 2-hour fire barriers if required by  
Section 414.2.4. Vertical isolation of control areas must be accomplished by floors having a  
minimum 2-hour fire-resistance rating. Under limited conditions, the floor construction of the  
control area separation may be reduced to 1 hour. Its application is limited to fully sprinklered  
two- or three-story buildings of Type IIA, IIIA, IV, or VA construction. In all cases, construction  
supporting such floors shall have an equivalent fire-resistance rating. A designated percentage of  
the maximum allowable quantities of hazardous materials is allowed in each control area per  
Table 414.2.2. See Figure 307-2.  
The permitted number of control areas decreases vertically through the building, as does the  
quantities of hazardous materials per control area. As hazardous materials are located higher and  
higher above ground level, they become more difficult to address under emergency conditions.  
As with many other conditions regulated by the code, a key factor is the ability of the fire  
department to access the incident area. The higher the hazardous materials are located in the  
building, the more restrictive the provisions become, owing to the limitations on fire department  
access and operations.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 307-2 Multistory areas.  
The number of control areas permitted within a single structure may also be increased by  
dividing the structure into two or more buildings with fire walls. The limits on control areas can  
be applied independently to each portion of a structure separated by fire walls complying with  
Section 706. As a result, an increased amount of hazardous materials may now be present  
without classification as a Group H occupancy where fire walls divide a structure into separate  
buildings.  
Storage and use. One other fundamental concept involved in applying the maximum allowable  
quantities is situation of material. The maximum allowable quantities in the code are based on  
three potential situations\: storage, use-closed, and use-open.  
Though not defined by the code, the term storage is generally considered to include materials  
that are idle and not immediately available for entering a process. The term not immediately  
available can be thought of as requiring direct human intervention to allow a material to enter a  
process or, alternatively, as using approved supervised valving systems that separate stored  
material from a process. In the case of liquids and gases, storage is generally considered to be  
limited to materials in closed vessels \(not open to the atmosphere\). For example, materials kept  
in closed containers such as drums or cans are in storage because deliberate action \(opening the  
drum or can\) would be required to use the material. However, when a container or tank is  
connected to a process, the question arises whether the material in the container or tank is in  
storage or in use.  
In general, the quantity of material that would be considered to be in use is the quantity that  
could normally be expected to be involved in a process, or that could reasonably be expected to  
be released or involved in an incident as a result of a process-related emergency. Consider, for  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationexample, a process having hazardous materials that are piped from an underground storage tank  
outside of a building to a dispensing outlet within a building. Because the tank is connected to a  
process within the building, it could be argued that the contents of the tank are available for use  
in the building \(see definition of “Use” \(Material\) in Section 202\) and that the amount should be  
counted toward the maximum allowable quantities. However, if an approved, reliable  
arrangement of valving is provided between the supply and the point where the material is  
dispensed, it would be reasonable to conclude that the quantity on the supply side of such  
valving that is outside of the building would be unlikely to impact incidents occurring within the  
building and, therefore, need not be counted toward the maximum allowable quantities. This  
reliable arrangement of valving can be considered an interruption of the connection between the  
confined material \(storage\) and the point where material is placed into action or made available  
for service. See Figure 307-3.  
Figure 307-3 Example of storage versus use.  
The difference between use-closed and use-open is basically whether the hazardous material  
in question is exposed to the atmosphere during a process, with the exception that gases are  
defined as always being in closed systems when used insofar as they would be immediately  
dispersed \(unless immediately consumed\) if exposed to the atmosphere without some means of  
containment.  
Table 307.1\(1\)—Maximum Allowable Quantity per Control Area of Hazardous Materials  
Posing a Physical Hazard. This table sets forth maximum allowable quantities for physical  
hazard materials. All three situations \(storage, use-closed, and use-open\) are considered. For the  
specific case of gases, maximum allowable amounts are all listed under storage and use-closed  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbecause the definition of “Use” includes all gases.  
With two exceptions, any combination of materials or situations listed in this table is allowed  
in each control area. These two exceptions are \(1\) as provided by Footnote h, the aggregate of  
IA, IB, and IC flammable liquids, and \(2\) as provided by Footnote b, which requires that  
aggregate quantities of materials in both use and storage must not exceed the allowable quantity  
for storage.  
Specific footnotes to the table provide the following information\:  
Footnote a. This footnote references Section 414.2 for the use of control areas. For additional  
information, see the discussion of control areas in Sections 307.1 and 414.2.  
Footnote b. This footnote requires quantities of materials that are in use to be counted as both  
storage and use when comparing quantities to those permitted. For example, a single control area  
in a manufacturing facility would be permitted up to 30 gallons \(116.25 L\) of a Class II  
combustible liquid in use and a maximum of 120 gallons \(454.2 L\) in storage without being  
considered a Group H occupancy. However, a total of 150 gallons \(567.75 L\) would be  
prohibited. The total of both use and storage is limited to 120 gallons \(454.2 L\), with no more  
than 30 gallons \(116.25 L\) permitted in use.  
Footnote c. This footnote exempts small size containers of certain consumer products that are  
considered to present minimal hazards based on the types of materials and the container sizes.  
Footnote d. This footnote allows certain materials to have exempt amounts doubled when  
stored or used in sprinklered buildings. Compounding with the increases provided by Footnote e  
is allowed when both footnotes are applicable. Materials and situations referencing both  
Footnotes d and e can receive four times the listed maximum allowable quantity when both  
footnotes are applied. See Application Example 307-1.  
Application Example 307-1  
Footnote e. This footnote allows exempt amounts for certain materials in storage to be  
doubled when approved storage cabinets, gas cabinets, safety cans, etc., as applicable, are  
employed. Also, see Footnote d and Application Example 307-1.  
Footnote f. This footnote allows certain materials to be stored or used in unlimited quantities  
in sprinklered buildings. When the building is fully sprinklered, it has the effect of classifying  
the building as other than a Group H occupancy. Application of this footnote is limited to the  
storage or use of Class IIIB combustible liquids or Class I oxidizers. An unlimited quantity of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationeach of these materials is permitted in a fully sprinklered building without requiring a  
designation of Group H.  
Footnote g. This footnote limits storage and use of certain materials to sprinklered buildings.  
Where the quantity does not exceed the maximum allowable, the building is required to be  
sprinklered throughout if a non-Group H classification is desired.  
Footnote h. Where flammable liquids are concerned, the maximum allowable quantities are  
regulated both individually and cumulatively. To be considered an occupancy other than Group  
H, the control area must not contain more than the maximum allowable quantities for each type  
of flammable liquid \(Classes IA, IB, and IC\), as well as the combination of such limits  
established by Table 307.1\(1\).  
Footnote i. Where in compliance with the requirements of International Fire Code® \(IFC®\)  
Section 603.3.2, the storage of fuel oil inside a building is not regulated for maximum allowable  
quantities \(MAQs\) by Table 307.1\(1\). The quantity of combustible liquid stored in tanks  
complying with Section 603.3.2 need not be counted toward the MAQs established in the table.  
Footnote k. Substantial increases in the maximum allowable quantities are permitted for  
Class 3 oxidizers used for maintenance and sanitation purposes. A common application of the  
increased quantities occurs in health-care facilities.  
Footnote l. If the net weight of the pyrotechnic composition of fireworks is known, that  
weight is used in applying the limitations of the table. Otherwise, 25 percent of the gross weight  
of the fireworks is to be used, including the packaging materials.  
Footnote o. Cotton is almost exclusively pressed and stored as densely packed baled cotton  
meeting the weight and dimension requirements of ISO 8115. In this form, the fibers are not  
easily ignitable, and the regulation by this table as a hazardous material is deemed unnecessary.  
Footnote p. This note further clarifies the application of Item 3 in Section 307.1.1. Where  
liquid or gaseous fuel is used in the operation of machinery or equipment, including vehicles, the  
quantities are not to be included in the determination of maximum allowable quantities.  
Additional allowances are provided for specific piping systems and appliances, as well as for  
dispensed alcohol-based hand rubs.  
Footnote q. The listing of combustible dusts in Table 307.1\(1\) is unique in that it is the only  
material listed where a maximum allowable quantity has not been established in order to  
determine occupancy classification. The classification of Group H-2 is to be based solely on a  
determination by a qualified person, firm, or corporation, along with concurrence of the building  
official. Reference is made to Section 414.1.3 where the general information that is required to  
make such a determination is set forth.  
Table 307.1\(2\)—Maximum Allowable Quantity per Control Area of Hazardous Materials  
Posing a Health Hazard. This table is similar in nature to Table 307.1\(1\), except that the  
maximum allowable quantities listed in Table 307.1\(2\) are for health hazard materials. For  
discussions of specific footnotes, see the above discussion of Table 307.1\(1\).  
307.1.1 Uses other than Group H. Prior to an analysis of MAQs and control areas in the  
determination of occupancy classification where hazardous materials are present, it would be  
wise to review the 19 varied conditions that are specified under which a Group H classification is  
not required in spite of the fact that the quantities of materials may exceed the amounts set forth  
in Table 307.1\(1\) or 307.1\(2\). Where one of these items applies to a building in which hazardous  
materials are used, handled, or stored, the building’s classification is to be determined based  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationupon which occupancy group it most nearly resembles. For example, the retail sales of  
flammable and combustible liquids will trigger a Group M classification provided such liquids  
are handled and displayed in compliance with the IFC. Such compliance with the IFC is also  
referenced for the installation of stationary storage battery systems and fuel cell power systems;  
aerosol product storage; black powder, smokeless propellant, and small arms primers storage;  
capacitor energy storage systems; and Group B college and university laboratory uses. It is  
important that the code user review all of the items listed in this section in order to properly  
classify those buildings, or portions of buildings, where hazardous materials are present.  
The application of flammable finishes is not considered a Group H condition provided the  
requirements of Section 416 are applied, as well as all applicable provisions of IFC Chapter 24.  
Detailed requirements set forth in the IFC for spray booths, spraying spaces, and spray rooms, as  
well as for spaces where dipping operations and powder coating occur, provide a degree of safety  
that allows for spray finishing and similar activities to be considered as non–Group H facilities.  
Where flammable or combustible liquids or gases are contained within a closed piping system  
and utilized solely for operational functions, such as where hydraulic fluid is utilized within  
heavy equipment and machinery, the amount of such fluids is not considered in the classification  
process. Refrigeration systems do not contribute to Group H consideration due to their regulation  
under the International Mechanical Code®  
. The use and/or storage of hazardous materials for  
agricultural purposes does not create a Group H occupancy designation provided the materials  
are limited to storage and use as needed on the premises.  
Distilling, brewing, and the storage of alcohol beverages, regardless of alcohol content and  
the quantity of liquid, are not considered as Group H occupancies where in compliance with the  
IFC. This allowance in large part takes into consideration the automatic sprinkler requirements  
for the manufacture of distilled spirits, or the bulk storage of distilled spirits or wine. Where the  
alcoholic beverages being manufactured or stored exceed 16-percent alcohol content, regardless  
of the liquid quantity, a sprinkler system shall be provided throughout the fire area containing the  
Group F-1 or S-1 occupancy. Due to the fire protection afforded by an automatic sprinkler  
system, along with other safeguards established in the IFC, the manufacture and storage of  
alcoholic beverages in any quantity is not to be considered as a Group H occupancy.  
Manufacturing activities are classified as Group F-1 or Group F-2 based on the alcohol content,  
while storage occupancy provisions address the concerns associated with classification as Group  
S-1 or Group S-2.  
Additional allowances are also provided within the provisions such that it is not appropriate,  
due to the safeguards and limitations imposed, that a Group H classification be assigned.  
307.8 Multiple hazards. As previously noted, most hazardous materials possess the  
characteristics of more than one hazard. This section requires that all hazards of materials must  
be addressed. For example, if a material possesses the hazard characteristics of a Class 2 oxidizer  
and a corrosive, the material would be regulated under the provisions for both Group H-3 and H-  
4 occupancies. The more restrictive provisions of each occupancy must be satisfied.  
Section 308 Institutional Group I  
Group I occupancies are institutional uses and in the IBC are considered to be basically of two  
broad types. The first are those facilities where individuals are under supervision and care  
because of physical limitations of health or age. The second category includes those facilities in  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwhich the personal liberties of the occupants are restricted.  
In both types, the occupants either are restricted in their movements or require supervision in  
an emergency, such as a fire, to escape the hazard by proceeding along an exit route to safety.  
There is actually a third category in which the occupants enjoy mobility and are reasonably free  
of constraints but do require a measure of professional care and are asleep for a portion of the  
day.  
As Group I occupancies are people-related occupancies, the primary hazard is from the  
occupants’ lack of free mobility needed to extricate themselves from a hazardous situation. On  
the other hand, the hazard from combustible contents is typically very low and, as a result, the  
occupancy requirements for Group I occupancies are essentially based on the limited free  
mobility of the occupants. Also, the occupants of most Group I occupancies are usually  
institutionalized for 24 hours or longer and therefore are asleep at some point during their stay.  
Thus, the protection requirements of the code are more comprehensive than in almost any other  
people-related occupancy. It should be noted that institutional occupancies described as Groups  
I-1, I-2, and I-4 may be classified as Group R-3 where care is provided for five or fewer persons.  
As an option for such small institutional uses, the structure need only comply with the IRC. The  
code typically recognizes that such small occupant loads in educational or institutional  
environments can be adequately addressed for fire and life safety through the provisions for  
dwelling units.  
Although the Group I-3 classification is only applicable where six or more individuals are  
restrained or secured, there is no indication as to the proper classification where five or fewer  
persons are involved. Where the intended detention or restraint occurs as an ancillary use within  
some other occupancy, classification would be based on that of the major occupancy. For  
example, up to five individuals could be restricted in areas such as interrogation rooms for  
alleged shoplifters in a covered mall building, jewelry viewing rooms for customers of a retail  
store, and time-out rooms in a school, without classifying that portion of the building a Group I-3  
occupancy. Further discussion on allowances for locking devices for such spaces can be found in  
the commentary on Section 1010.2.4, Item 1.  
308.2 Institutional Group I-1. The occupants housed in buildings classified as Group I-1  
occupancies live in a supervised environment where custodial care services are provided, such as  
assistance with cooking, bathing, and other daily tasks. Types of uses included in this category  
are halfway houses, alcohol and drug rehabilitation facilities, assisted living facilities, social  
rehabilitation facilities, and group homes. It is possible that a listed use may rather be considered  
a Group I-2 or I-3 occupancy if the residents are incapable of self-preservation because of injury,  
illness, or incarceration. For example, an alcohol treatment center may provide lockdown for a  
number of persons under care. Where this number exceeds five, a Group I-3 classification would  
be more appropriate than a Group I-1.  
The naming, classification, and regulation of these uses by individual state licensing agencies  
may not exactly correlate with the IBC list of uses. The actual “condition” of such uses also  
varies between states. It is for these reasons that the Group I-1 list of uses is included under the  
general occupancy classification and not under the specific condition. The Group I-1  
classification should correlate how the specific state licensing regulations relate to the code’s  
occupancy, care type, number of persons receiving care, and condition of evacuation capability.  
A similar review and analysis is warranted for Group R-4 occupancies where the only differing  
factor from Group I-1 is the number of persons receiving care.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe specific classification is based on the number of residents. In this case, a Group I-1 is the  
proper classification where more than 16 occupants are receiving custodial care. The threshold of  
17 or more is based on the number of supervised individuals who reside in the facility and does  
not include associated staff members. Where the number of residents is between 6 and 16  
inclusive, a Group R-4 classification is appropriate. Those supervised residential facilities that  
provide custodial care services for five or fewer occupants can be either considered a Group R-3  
occupancy or designed and constructed under the provisions of the IRC.  
The care uses recognized as Group I-1 occupancies are further divided into two  
classifications, Condition 1 and Condition 2. Condition 1 includes those facilities where the care  
recipients are capable of self-preservation and no assistance is required for building evacuation  
or relocation under emergency conditions. Condition 2 recognizes a higher degree of hazard in  
that the persons receiving care require some limited amount of verbal or physical assistance in  
order to evacuate or relocate in response to an emergency situation. Provisions related to number  
of stories, smoke barriers, sprinkler systems, and smoke detection are more stringent in  
Condition 2 occupancies as opposed to those applicable to Condition 1 facilities. It is anticipated  
that most assisted living, memory care, and residential board and care facilities will appropriately  
be classified as Condition 2 facilities.  
Group I-1 custodial care recipients and their conditions are different from those in Group I-2  
facilities, establishing different emergency preparedness concepts per the IFC. Group I-2 medical  
care recipients typically have higher acuity levels than Group I-1 custodial care recipients.  
Individuals in custodial care still participate in fire drills with or without assistance from others,  
versus medical care which implements defend-in-place strategies during emergencies. Group I-1,  
Condition 2 implements essentially a staged evacuation concept by utilizing smoke  
compartments per the IFC.  
“Limited verbal or physical assistance” with evacuation assumes differences in abilities  
between medical care and custodial care recipients, with assumed limits placed on custodial care.  
Such custodial care recipients are conscious and not on life support systems, therefore bed  
movement is not required under emergency egress situations as is typically required in Group I-2  
facilities. A custodial care recipient requiring assistance with emergency evacuation may require  
help getting out of bed into a wheelchair or walker, but then can proceed with or without  
assistance from others during evacuation. Custodial care recipients receiving assistance during  
evacuation also assumes varying mental limitations requiring verbal assistance, such as a person  
with mental disabilities, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease.  
308.3 Institutional Group I-2. The primary feature that distinguishes the Group I-2 occupancy  
from the others is that it is a medical care facility in which the patients are, in general,  
nonambulatory and incapable of self-preservation. This classification includes hospitals,  
detoxification facilities, psychiatric hospitals, and nursing homes. The nursing homes included in  
this category are deemed to provide intermediate care or skilled nursing care. Foster care  
facilities for the full-time care of infants \(under the age of 2½ years\) are included in this  
classification, as the code assumes that the very young require the same protection as is provided  
for those individuals whose capability of self-preservation is severely restricted. Where care is  
provided for a limited time period, such as at an outpatient health-care clinic or ambulatory care  
facility, a classification of Group I-2 is not appropriate. In such cases, a Group B classification is  
warranted, even in those cases where some of the patients are incapable of self-preservation.  
Due to the diversification of how medical care is provided in the five characteristic uses as  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationestablished in the code, the Group I-2 classification is divided into two basic categories\:  
Condition 1, long-term care \(nursing homes\), and Condition 2, short-term care \(hospitals\).  
Changes in how care is delivered have recently included a general increase in the ratio of floor  
area per patient in hospitals due to the increase in diagnostic equipment and the movement  
toward single-occupant patient rooms, as well as the trend to provide more residential-type  
arrangements in nursing homes, such as group suite living and cooking facilities. Although most  
applicable code requirements apply equally to both medical care conditions classified as Group I-  
2, the division of uses does allow for varying provisions based upon the type of care being  
provided. An example of differences in the requirements is addressed in the discussion of  
Section 407.5.1 regarding smoke compartments.  
308.4 Institutional Group I-3. The uses of Group I-3 occupancies encompass jails, prisons,  
reformatories, detention centers, and other buildings where the personal liberties of the residents  
are similarly restricted. For guidance on the classification of detention facilities having occupant  
loads of five or less, see the general discussion of Section 308. The classification of Group I-3  
buildings shall also include one of five occupancy conditions. Several provisions specific to  
Group I-3 occupancies vary based on which condition is anticipated, such as the manner of  
subdividing resident housing areas. The conditions are described as follows\:  
1\. The highest level of freedom assigned to a Group I-3 occupancy is considered Condition  
1\. Free movement is permitted throughout the sleeping areas and the common areas,  
including access to the exterior for egress purposes. A facility classified as Condition 1 is  
permitted to be constructed as a Group R occupancy, most likely a Group R-2. There may  
also be cases where it is more appropriate to classify the use as some occupancy other  
than Group R. For example, an industrial building included within a Condition 1 facility  
would most probably be classified as a Group F-1 occupancy.  
2\. Condition 2 buildings permit free movement between smoke compartments; however,  
access to the exterior for egress purposes is restricted because of locked exits.  
3\. Access between smoke compartments is not permitted in Condition 3 occupancies, except  
for the remote-controlled release of locked doors for necessary egress travel. Movement  
within each individual smoke compartment is permitted, including access to individual  
sleeping rooms and group activity spaces.  
4\. Condition 4 buildings restrict the movement of occupants to their own space, with no  
freedom to travel to other sleeping areas or common areas. Movement to other sleeping  
rooms, activity spaces, and other compartments is controlled through a remote release  
system.  
5\. The lack of freedom provided in Condition 5 facilities is consistent with that of Condition  
4\. However, staff-controlled manual release is necessary to permit movement throughout  
other portions of the building.  
308.5 Institutional Group I-4, day-care facilities. Where custodial care is provided for persons  
for periods less than 24 hours at a time, an occupancy classification of Group I-4 is appropriate.  
The code further restricts this category by limiting the care to individuals other than parents,  
guardians, or relatives. This occupancy classification is appropriate for day-care facilities with  
children no older than 2½ years of age, as well as older persons who are deemed to require  
assistance if evacuation or relocation is necessary due to an emergency situation. The need for  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsupervision and custodial care services is the primary factor that contributes to this type of use  
being classified as an institutional occupancy.  
Day-care facilities for children above the age of 30 months are considered educational  
occupancies \(Group E\). Where certain conditions are met, such a facility caring for  
infants/toddlers \(30 months or less in age\) may also be classified as Group E. See the discussion  
on Section 305.2. Where the care activities are for adults who can physically respond to an  
emergency situation without physical or verbal assistance, an institutional classification is not  
appropriate. Rather, the facility would more likely be classified as Group B.  
Section 309 Mercantile Group M  
The mercantile uses listed in this section are mostly self-explanatory. For the most part,  
occupants of this type of use are ambulatory individuals, with any young children supervised by  
parents or other adults. Although the occupancies may contain a variety of combustible goods,  
the possibility of ignition is limited. High-hazard materials may be present in small quantities,  
but not enough of the material is present to be considered a Group H occupancy. For the  
limitations on hazardous materials in a Group M occupancy, see the discussion on Section 414.  
As a sales operation, a service station whose primary function is the fueling of motor vehicles  
is considered a Group M occupancy. The Group M designation applies to any building or kiosk  
used to support the function of vehicle fueling. This classification would also apply to a canopy  
constructed over the pump islands. By assigning the structures associated with the fueling of  
motor vehicles a classification the same as that for other sales operations, such as convenience  
stores, there is no question as to the proper application of the code. Through the design and  
construction of a motor-vehicle service station in conformance with Section 406.7 and the IFC,  
there is no distinct uncontrolled hazard that would cause separate and unique occupancies to be  
assigned. Conversely, where service or repair activities are involved, a Group S-1 classification  
is warranted. This would include operations such as the exchange of parts, such as tire and  
muffler shops, as well as service-oriented activities \(oil change and lubrication work\).  
Section 310 Residential Group R  
Group R occupancies are residential occupancies and are characterized by\:  
1\. 2. 3. Use by people for living and sleeping purposes.  
Relatively low potential fire severity.  
The worst fire record of all structure fires.  
The basic premise of the provisions in this section is that the occupants of residential  
buildings will be spending about one-third of the day asleep and that the potential for a fire  
getting out of control before the occupants are awake is quite probable. Furthermore, once  
awakened, the occupants will be somewhat confused and disoriented, particularly in hotels.  
310.1 Residential Group R. The four unique residential classifications are based on occupant  
load and density as well as the permanency of the occupants. Therefore, hotels, motels, and  
similar uses in which the occupants are essentially transient in nature are distinct in classification  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfrom apartment houses. The reason for this distinction is the occupants’ lack of familiarity with  
their surroundings. This in turn leads to confusion and disorientation when a fire occurs while the  
occupants are asleep. Because of this key difference, hotels and motels are considered Group R-1  
occupancies, whereas apartment houses are designated as Group R-2. The uses classified as  
Group R-3 and R-4 include both transient- and nontransient-type facilities housing limited  
numbers of occupants.  
310.2 Residential Group R-1. In addition to hotels and motels for transient guests, the Group R-  
1 classification also includes boarding houses and congregate living facilities where the number  
of transient occupants exceeds 10 persons. Such facilities are permitted to be classified as Group  
R-3 rather than Group R-1 where the occupant load does not exceed 10; however, they are not  
permitted to be constructed in accordance with the IRC. Consider a transient lodging operation  
consisting of a large number of single-family cabins containing living, cooking, sleeping, and  
sanitation facilities. The cabins could be classified in whole as a Group R-1 occupancy, or more  
probably, each individual cabin would be considered as a Group R-3 structure, provided the  
occupant load of the cabin does not exceed 10 persons. However, it would not be appropriate to  
apply the provisions of the IRC to this type of transient use.  
310.3 Residential Group R-2. Included in the Group R-2 occupancy classification along with  
apartment buildings are dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, convents, and monasteries.  
These types of uses are considered congregate living facilities. By definition, they contain one or  
more sleeping units where the residents share bathroom and/or kitchen facilities. Another type of  
nontransient congregate living facility is a boarding house. Common in residential areas adjacent  
to college and university campuses, boarding houses are also often located in urban areas of  
cities. An occupancy classification of Group R-2 is only appropriate for congregate living  
facilities where the occupant load of the facility is 17 or more persons. A lesser number will  
result in a Group R-3 classification. On the other hand, apartment buildings containing three or  
more dwelling units are always considered Group R-2 occupancies regardless of the building’s  
occupant load. The Group R-2 classification is also appropriate for live/work units as regulated  
by Section 508.5. Live/work units include those dwelling units or sleeping units where a  
significant portion of the space includes a nonresidential use operated by the tenant.  
310.4 Residential Group R-3. Group R-3 occupancies are generally limited to small congregate  
living facilities and lodging houses with limited occupant loads. Other Group R-3 occupancies  
include mixed-occupancy buildings containing only one or two dwelling units, as well as those  
small facilities used for various types of care. It is expected that the occupant load of a Group R-  
3 occupancy will be quite low. Typically, dwellings would not be classified as Group R-3  
occupancies, as they will be regulated by the IRC. Only where the dwelling falls outside the  
scope of the IRC will the Group R-3 classification for such structures be appropriate. For  
example, a four-story-above-grade-plane dwelling would be regulated as an R-3 occupancy, as  
would a single dwelling unit located above a small retail store. As previously indicated, boarding  
houses and congregate living facilities, both transient and nontransient in nature, may be  
classified as Group R-3 where the occupant load is relatively low.  
Where the use of a single-family dwelling classified as a Group R-3 occupancy consists of  
care activities, the IRC may be used, provided the building falls under the scoping provisions of  
the IRC. It should be noted that Group R-3 uses permitted to be constructed under the provisions  
of the IRC are required either to be protected by an NFPA 13D automatic sprinkler system or to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcomply with the IRC residential sprinkler system provisions of Section P2904.  
Where a structure is used as a lodging house having no more than five guest rooms and no  
more than 10 occupants, such as a small bed-and-breakfast facility, it is initially considered as a  
Group R-3 occupancy. However, where the lodging house is also owner-occupied, the provisions  
of the IRC may be applied for its design, construction, and use. This allowance recognizes the  
single-family dwellings with limited guests create little, if any, additional hazard beyond those  
structures regulated under the IRC. In both cases, where either the number of guest rooms in a  
lodging house exceeds five or the total number of occupants exceeds 10, a classification of  
Group R-1 is appropriate.  
310.5 Residential Group R-4. Assisted living facilities, halfway houses \(Figure 310-1\), and  
other 24-hour custodial care facilities are to be classified as Group R-4 occupancies, provided the  
number of residents under custodial care does not exceed 16. Where the number of residents is  
five or less, the use is considered a Group R-3 occupancy. The list of Group R-4 uses is fully  
consistent with those designated as Group I-1 \(more than 16 persons receiving care\), as the only  
difference between the two classifications is the number of persons who receive custodial care.  
Two conditions of use are established in a manner consistent with that for Group I-1  
occupancies. The discussion of Section 308.2 addresses these conditions in significant detail.  
The Group R-4 classification applied to supervised custodial care facilities differentiates them  
from Group R-3 care facilities based solely on the number of persons receiving care. For the  
most part, there is no difference between the hazards that are anticipated at such facilities.  
Therefore, the code mandates that those uses classified as Group R-4 comply with the  
requirements for Group R-3 occupancies except for those requirements specific to Group R-4  
occupancies.  
Figure 310-1 Group R-4 halfway house.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAs an example, assume an assisted living facility has accommodations for up to 12 persons  
who receive custodial care. The facility would be classified as a Group R-4 occupancy since the  
number of care recipients is more than 5 but less than 17. However, most of the applicable code  
requirements would be based on a Group R-3 classification. Stair riser heights would be limited  
to 7¾ inches with minimum tread runs of 10 inches required, as set forth in Exception 3 to  
Section 1011.5.2. A reduction in the required 42-inch height of guards would be permitted per  
Section 1015.3, Exceptions 1 through 3. Unless the code specifically identifies a requirement as  
applicable to a Group R-4 occupancy, the provisions for Group R-3 shall be met.  
There are, however, a number of provisions specifically established for Group R-4  
occupancies. Using the example in the preceding paragraph, Table 506.2 is to be used as the  
basis for allowable building areas based on the Group R-4 classification, with an allowable area  
factor of 7,000 square feet \(650.3 m2\) if the building is of Type VB construction and provided  
with an NFPA 13R sprinkler system. Smoke alarms are generally required under the provisions  
of Section 907.2.11.2, and an Accessible unit would be mandated per Section 1108.6.4.  
Section 311 Storage Group S  
In general, the Group S designation includes storage occupancies that are not highly hazardous  
as well as uses related to the storage, servicing, or repair of motor vehicles. Such storage uses are  
classified into two divisions based on the hazard level involved. Group S-1 describes those  
buildings used for moderate-hazard storage purposes, whereas low-hazard uses make up the  
Group S-2 classification.  
Before addressing the two different types of storage uses, consideration should be given to the  
classification of borderline uses. An exclusionary rule is used to assist in determining those  
moderate-hazard storage uses that are to be classified as Group S-1. For example, a Group S-1  
occupancy is used for storage uses not classified as a Group S-2 or H occupancy. The building  
official will often be called upon to decide which classification is most appropriate when a use  
can fall within the two Group S occupancy classifications. As guidance in making this decision,  
it is usually more appropriate to choose the most restrictive occupancy, which is the Group S-1.  
Classifying the use into the more restrictive category would allow the building to be protected at  
a higher level and address the worst-case situations that might occur. By classifying the use into  
the least restrictive category, it would typically reduce the required controls, causing a potential  
problem where the building operator chooses to store combustible materials within the building.  
311.1.1 Accessory storage spaces. The classification approach to storage rooms is similar to that  
of other support areas within a building. Where the hazard level within the storage area is such  
that the provisions for the general building use do not adequately address the risks posed by the  
storage use, the storage room is to be classified as a Group S occupancy. There has been a  
historic consensus that small storage areas pose only a limited concern above that anticipated due  
to the major use of the building, thus allowing such small storage spaces to be included as part of  
the major classification.  
However, the classification of larger storage rooms has historically been one of the most  
elusive issues in the IBC. Assigning a Group S occupancy classification to a warehouse, or other  
significant storage area, has never been questioned. However, where the room or space poses  
little, if any, hazard above that created by the occupancy to which the storage use is accessory, it  
is not necessary that a Group S classification be applied. The current approach to classifying a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstorage area is formally addressed such that storage rooms or spaces that are accessory to other  
uses are to be classified as part of the occupancy to which they are accessory, regardless of the  
size of the storage area.  
The classification of storage spaces does not vary based upon the size of the storage space.  
There is no square footage or percentage threshold, such as 100 square feet or 10 percent, over  
which the Group S classification will be applied. Where the storage use is considered as  
accessory to the other uses in the building, it is to be classified in accordance with those other  
uses. The key point is the hazard level that storage brings to the building. It is assumed that  
accessory storage uses pose little additional hazard above the occupancies which they serve.  
Where storage activities pose a significantly higher hazard than the other uses in the building,  
they would typically not be considered accessory and therefore classified as a Group S  
occupancy.  
311.2 Moderate-hazard storage, Group S-1. Group S-1 occupancies are typically used for the  
storage of combustible commodities. A complete list of all products allowed in this use would be  
very lengthy; however, many of the more common storage items are identified by the code. In  
general, buildings classified in this manner would be used for the storage of commodities that are  
manufactured within buildings classified as Group F-1 occupancies. Commodities that constitute  
a high physical or health hazard, and exceed the maximum allowable quantities set forth in  
Section 307, would be stored in the appropriate Group H occupancy. Repair garages for motor  
vehicles are considered Group S-1 occupancies. See the discussion in Section 202 regarding the  
definition of a repair garage.  
311.3 Low-hazard storage, Group S-2. Group S-2 occupancies include the storage of  
noncombustible commodities, as well as open or enclosed parking garages. Buildings in which  
noncombustible goods are packaged in film or paper wrappings or cardboard cartons, or stored  
on wooden pallets are still considered Group S-2 occupancies. This also includes any products  
that have minor amounts of plastics, such as knobs, handles, or similar trim items. It is important,  
however, that the commodities being stored are essentially noncombustible, insofar as the  
provisions that regulate Group S-2 occupancies are based on an anticipated minimal fire load.  
The classification of a warehouse or similar storage building as a Group S-2 occupancy is  
incumbent upon the expectation that combustible materials will not be stored within the building.  
This expectation is almost always difficult to achieve due to the transient nature of the materials  
being stored. It is not uncommon for the types of materials being stored to vary significantly  
from one month to the next, particularly for those storage activities not directly related to a  
specific manufacturing function. Therefore, the most common type of Group S-2 storage  
condition would be an extension of a Group S-2 manufacturing operation, where the types of  
materials being stored are consistent with those being manufactured or produced.  
Section 312 Utility and Miscellaneous Group U  
This section covers those utility occupancies that are not normally occupied by people, such as  
sheds and other accessory buildings, carports, small garages, fences, tanks and towers, and  
agricultural buildings. The fire load in these structures and uses varies considerably but is usually  
not excessive. Because they are normally not occupied, the concern for fire load is not very  
great, and as a group these uses constitute a low hazard. It is also important to note that a Group  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationU occupancy is not expected to have any public use.  
Group U occupancies can generally be divided into two areas. The first includes those  
buildings that are accessory to other major-use structures. Although these accessory-use  
buildings will at times be occupied, the time period for occupancy is typically limited to short  
intervals. The second type of Group U occupancy is those miscellaneous structures that cannot  
be properly classified into any other listed occupancy. The structures are not intended to be  
occupied, but must be classified in order to regulate any hazards they may pose to property or  
adjoining structures and persons.  
The uses classified as Group U have been deemed to pose little, if any, risk to persons who  
may be present. Where hazards exist that are not typical of those represented by a Group U  
classification, it is important that another occupancy classification be assigned. For example, an  
agricultural building used as an arena for horse shows or livestock auctions should typically be  
regulated as a Group A assembly occupancy rather than a Group U agricultural structure.  
A greenhouse best illustrates the approach established in Section 312.1 for classifying  
structures as Group U occupancies only where they cannot be appropriately classified as any  
other occupancy. Where greenhouses are used for assembly, sales, education, or other activities  
that are more extensive in scope than addressed in the definition, their classification as Group U  
is not appropriate. Only where the characteristics and hazards do not cause classification as some  
other occupancy should a greenhouse be considered as a Group U occupancy.  
If the jurisdiction has adopted Appendix C, then it will govern the design and construction of  
agricultural buildings that come under its purview; however, many urban jurisdictions do not  
adopt this appendix chapter. In this case, should an occasional agricultural building be  
constructed, it would be regulated by Section 312.  
KEY POINTS  
• Proper occupancy classification is a critical decision in determining code compliance.  
• Uses are classified by the code into categories of like hazards, based on the risk to  
occupants of the building as well as the probability of property loss.  
• Group A occupancies, typically include rooms and buildings with an occupant load of  
50 or more, used for the gathering together of persons for civic, social, or religious  
functions; recreation, food, or drink consumption; or similar activities.  
• The hazards unique to Group A occupancies are based primarily on the sizable  
occupant loads and the concentration of occupants into very small areas.  
• Business uses, such as offices, are classified as Group B occupancies and are  
considered moderate-hazard occupancies.  
• Group E occupancies are limited to schools for students through 12th grade and most  
day-care operations.  
• Manufacturing occupancies, classified as Group F, are classified based on whether the  
materials being produced are combustible or noncombustible.  
• Group H occupancies are heavily regulated because of the quantities of hazardous  
materials present in use or storage.  
• Where amounts of hazardous materials are limited in control areas to below the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmaximum allowable quantities, the occupancy need not be considered a Group H.  
• Both physical hazards and health hazards are addressed under the requirements for  
Group H occupancies.  
• Institutional occupancies, classified as Group I, are facilities where individuals are  
under supervision and care because of physical limitations of health or age, or that  
house individuals whose personal liberties are restricted.  
• Group M occupancies include both sales rooms and motor fuel–dispensing facilities.  
• Residential Group R occupancies are partially regulated based on occupant load or  
number of units, as well as the occupants’ familiarity with their surroundings.  
• Group S occupancies for storage are viewed in a manner consistent with Group F  
manufacturing uses.  
• Group U occupancies are utilitarian in nature and are seldom, if ever, occupied.

Key Points  
This chapter provides specific detailed regulations for those types of buildings, features and  
uses that have very unique characteristics and hazards. The uses in this chapter, though  
encompassing only a very small fraction of the uses commonly encountered, require special  
consideration. Some of the provisions address conditions that could occur in various  
occupancy classifications such as covered and open mall buildings, high-rise buildings, and  
underground buildings. Concerns associated with motor-vehicle-related uses, hazardous  
occupancies, and institutional uses are specifically addressed. Special elements within a  
building, such as stages, platforms, motion picture projection rooms, and atriums, are also  
regulated by this chapter. In addition, a variety of special concerns regarding hazardous  
materials, processes, and activities are addressed through specific requirements.  
In all cases it should be remembered that the provisions found in this chapter deal in a more  
detailed manner with uses and occupancies also addressed elsewhere in the code. Some of the  
provisions in this chapter may be more restrictive than the general requirements of the code,  
whereas others may be less restrictive. The general rules found in other areas of the  
International Building Code® \(IBC®\) will govern unless modifications from this chapter are  
applicable  
Section 402 Covered Mall and Open Mall Buildings  
Provisions for covered mall and open mall buildings included in the IBC set forth specific code  
requirements for a specific building type. Provisions in this section only apply to covered and  
open mall buildings having a height of not more than three levels at any one point and not more  
than three stories above grade plane. Furthermore, the provisions are only those that are  
considered to be unique to covered and open mall buildings. For those features that are not  
unique, the general provisions of the code apply. Covered and open mall buildings that comply  
in all respects with other provisions of the code are not required to comply with these provisions.  
It should be noted that foyers and lobbies of office buildings, hotels, and apartment buildings are  
not required to comply with the special provisions for covered or open mall buildings. An  
example of an open mall and associated buildings is shown in Figure 402-1.  
402.1.1 Open mall building perimeter line. It is necessary that a perimeter line for an open  
mall building be established in order to apply various requirements in Section 402. The line  
creates the boundary of the tenant spaces, service areas, pedestrian paths, and similar spaces that  
make up the open mall building, but does not include any anchor buildings or parking garages.  
An example is shown in Figure 402-2.  
402.2 Open space. The special provisions of Section 402 are applicable only where the entire  
building, including the anchor buildings and attached parking structures, are surrounded by  
permanent open space at least 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) in width See Figure 402-3. The allowance  
provided in the exception to Section 402.2 for reduced open space surrounding covered mall  
buildings, including their associated parking garages and anchor stores, is consistent with that for  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationother unlimited area buildings as permitted by Section 507 since a covered mall building  
contains similar characteristics of those buildings. The reduction in required open space is not  
permitted where the covered mall building or anchor stores include Group E, H, I, or R  
occupancies. Where a building is considered an open mall building, the required permanent open  
space is regulated based on the open mall building perimeter line as described in Section 402.1.1.  
Figure 402-1 Open mall.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 402-2 Open mall building perimeter line.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 402-3 Covered mall building.  
402.4 Construction. Where covered and open mall buildings no more than three stories above  
grade plane are constructed of other than Type V construction, they may be of unlimited area.  
Associated anchor buildings of Type I, II, III, or IV construction may also have unlimited floor  
area provided they are no more than three stories in height above grade plane. For those anchor  
buildings exceeding three stories, the general height and area limitations of Chapter 5 are  
applicable, including appropriate increases for frontage and the presence of an automatic  
sprinkler system. In all cases, the minimum type of construction required for any open or  
enclosed parking garage is that mandated by Section 406.  
Tenant spaces must be separated from each other by fire partitions complying with Section  
708\. In addition to protecting one tenant from the activities of a neighbor, the tenant separation  
requirements for malls are also intended to assist in the goal of restricting fire to the area of  
origin. There is no requirement, however, for the separation of tenant spaces from the mall itself.  
As a general rule, an anchor building is viewed as a separate building from the covered mall  
building. Therefore, a fire wall must be used to provide the necessary fire-resistive separation.  
However, only a fire barrier is required where the anchor building is no more than three stories in  
height and its use is consistent with one of those identified in the definition of “covered mall  
building” in Section 202. Although some type of 2-hour fire-resistance-rated separation is  
mandated between an anchor building and the mall, openings in such a separation typically need  
no fire-protection rating. Anchor buildings, other than those containing Group R-1 sleeping  
units, constructed of Type I or II noncombustible construction may have unprotected openings  
into the mall.  
Under the concept of covered and open mall buildings, there is no requirement for a fire  
separation between tenant spaces and the mall. Similarly, the food court needs no separation  
between adjacent tenant spaces and the mall. The hazards presented by an attached parking  
garage, however, must be addressed through the separation provided by a minimum 2-hour fire-  
resistance-rated fire barrier.  
402.5 Automatic sprinkler system. An automatic fire-sprinkler system is the primary means of  
fire protection for a covered mall building. The system is required throughout all portions of the  
covered mall building other than open parking garages. Additionally, the code requires a  
standpipe system in accordance with Section 905. Because of the reliance placed on the sprinkler  
system, this section requires the following additional safeguards\:  
1\. The code requires that the sprinkler system be complete and operative throughout all of  
the covered mall building before occupancy of any of the tenant spaces. In those areas that  
are unoccupied, an alternative protection method may be approved by the building  
official.  
2\. The mall, anchor buildings, and tenant spaces shall be protected by separate sprinkler  
systems, except that the code will permit tenant spaces to be supplied by the same system  
as the mall, provided they can be independently controlled.  
Sprinkler protection is also required for open mall buildings. This protection must extend to  
beneath any exterior circulation balconies located adjacent to the open mall.  
402.6.2 Kiosks. Kiosks and similar structures, both temporary and permanent in nature, are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationregulated for construction materials and fire protection owing to their presence in an established  
egress path. Such structures shall be noncombustible or constructed of fire-retardant-treated  
wood, complying foam plastics, or complying aluminum composite materials. Active fire  
protection is provided by required fire suppression and detection devices. Kiosks are also limited  
in size, and their relationship to other kiosks is regulated. Multiple kiosks can be grouped  
together, provided their total area does not exceed 300 square feet \(28 m2\). At that point, a  
separation of at least 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) is required from another kiosk or grouping of kiosks.  
402.8 Means of egress. One of the significant areas in which the provisions for covered mall and  
open mall buildings differ from the general provisions applied to the majority of buildings is the  
means of egress. Issues such as occupant load determination and travel distance are modified  
specifically in this section owing to the unique features of a covered or open mall building. It is  
important to remember that where this section conflicts with the general requirements of the code  
in Chapter 10, the provisions of this section are applicable.  
402.8.1 Mall width. With its added life-safety systems, the mall may be considered a corridor  
without meeting the means of egress size requirements of Section 1005.1 when the mall  
complies with the conditions of this section as depicted in Figure 402-4. In this case, the code  
requires that the minimum mall width be 20 feet \(6,096 mm\), and this typical cross section  
shows that the minimum required width may be divided so that a clear width of 10 feet \(3,048  
mm\) is provided separately on each side of any kiosks, vending machines, benches, displays,  
etc., contained in the mall. In addition, food court seating in the mall would have to be located so  
as not to encroach upon any required mall width. Understandably, the mall width shall also  
accommodate the occupant load immediately tributary thereto.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 402-4 Mall width requirements.  
402.8.2 Determination of occupant load. The determination of the occupant load and minimum  
required number of exits can be divided into two areas\:  
1\. Tenant spaces.  
2\. The covered or open mall building.  
The maximum occupant load of any individual tenant space is determined in a manner  
consistent with its use as regulated by Chapter 10. Means of egress requirements for individual  
tenant spaces are to be based on the occupant load as typically determined. Figure 402-5 depicts  
the method for determination of the occupant load in a tenant space having a retail area, a storage  
room, an office, and a bathroom. Although the total tenant space contains 1,500 square feet  
\(139.3 m2\) of floor area, each individual use has a designated occupant load based on the  
appropriate factor from Table 1004.5. In this example, the occupant load would be calculated at  
23.  
Not only must the occupant load be determined for each individual tenant space, but the  
occupant load for the entire covered or open mall building must also be determined. It is highly  
unlikely that all tenant spaces will be fully occupied at the same time in a covered or open mall  
building. However, the mall will itself have a significant occupant load independent of the tenant  
spaces. Therefore, a different method is used to determine the number of occupants from which  
to base the means of egress from the mall itself. This occupant load is to be determined based on  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe gross leasable area of the covered or open mall building, excluding any anchor buildings and  
those tenant spaces having an independent means of egress, with the occupant-load factor  
determined by the following formula\:  
Figure 402-5 Occupant load and means of egress from tenant space.  
Occupant-load factor = \(0.00007\) \(gross leasable area\) + 25  
As a result, the net effect is that the total occupant load computed for the covered or open mall  
building will be something less than the summation of the occupant loads determined for each  
individual tenant space.  
The occupant-load factor used for egress purposes shall not exceed 50, nor is it ever required  
to be less than 30. Where there is a food court provided within the covered or open mall building,  
the occupant load of the food court is to be added to the occupant load of the covered or open  
mall building as previously calculated in order to determine the total occupant load.  
In utilizing several examples, assume a building contains 600,000 square feet \(55,740 m2\) of  
gross leasable area. The occupant-load factor, when calculated, would be 67. However, a factor  
of 50 would be used in determining an occupant load of 12,000. Should a food court be present  
that seats 600 occupants, the occupant load of 12,000 would be increased accordingly. Where a  
covered mall building contains 100,000 square feet \(9,290 m2\) of gross leasable area, the  
occupant-load factor would be 32. A factor of 32 would then be used to calculate the occupant  
load of the covered mall building, which would be 3,125 occupants. As the provision is applied  
to a smaller covered mall building, an occupant-load factor of 30 will be used when the gross  
leasable area of the covered mall building is less than 71,500 \(6,642.3 m2\) square feet. As a final  
note, because anchor buildings are not considered a part of a covered mall building, their  
occupant load shall not be included in computing the total number of occupants for the mall.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation402.8.3 Number of means of egress. Figure 402-5 also depicts the requirements of Section  
402.8.3 for the determination of the number of means of egress from the tenant space. Based on  
the occupant load of 23, the provisions of Chapter 10 would require only one means of egress  
from this tenant space. Therefore, the number of means of egress complies with the code.  
However, if the distance, x, exceeds 75 feet \(22,860 mm\), two means of egress would be  
required even though the occupant load is less than 50.  
402.8.4 Arrangements of means of egress. The provisions of this section are unique to the  
covered mall building and are depicted in Figure 402-6. The limitations described in this section  
encompass a high number and density of occupants, and this section prevents those occupants  
from having to traverse long portions of the mall to reach a means of egress. The provisions also  
prevent the overcrowding of the mall, such as if a large number of patrons from these uses were  
to be discharged into the mall at the same time and some distance from a means of egress. An  
open mall building is addressed a bit differently in that assembly occupancies located within the  
perimeter line are permitted to have their main exit open at any point into the open mall.  
Figure 402-6 Arrangement of exits.  
In securing the intent of Section 402, the provisions of Section 402.8.4.1 establish the  
requirement that means of egress for anchor buildings shall be provided independently from the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmall exit system. Furthermore, the mall shall not egress through the anchor buildings. Moreover,  
the termination of a mall at an anchor building where no other means of egress has been  
provided except through the anchor buildings shall be considered to be a dead end, which is  
limited in accordance with the exception to Section 402.8.6.  
402.8.5 Distance to exits. Figure 402-7 depicts the multifaceted provisions of this section as it  
relates to a covered mall building as follows\:  
1\. The first case is illustrated for travel within the tenant space and includes the provisions  
applicable to tenant spaces A and B. For tenant space A, the diagram depicts the  
application of the code for a tenant space with a closed front with only a swinging exit  
door to the mall. The entrance to the mall would be the point at which occupants from the  
tenant space pass through the egress door from the tenant space to the mall.  
Tenant space B represents the condition for an open storefront using a security grille  
instead of a standard egress door. The entrance to the mall in this case is the point at  
which occupants of the tenant space pass by an imaginary plane that is common to both  
the tenant space and the pedestrian mall. The location of the assumed required clear exit  
width along the open front of tenant space B may be placed at any point along the front,  
and its location would depend only on that which would render the least-restrictive  
application of the provisions.  
For either tenant space A or B, the code permits the travel distance within the tenant  
space to the entrance to the mall to be a maximum of 200 feet \(60,960 mm\).  
2\. After the occupants exit from a tenant space into the mall, the code permits another 200  
feet \(60,960 mm\) of exit access travel distance to one of the exit elements described in  
Section 202. This travel limitation also applies to all other locations in the mall where  
occupants may be located when an exiting condition occurs.  
It can be seen from this discussion, plus the perusal of Figure 402-7, that the travel  
distances permitted for a covered mall building are generally more liberal than those  
permitted by Section 1017.2. This liberalized and increased travel distance is based on the  
rationale that travel within a mall will be within an area where special fire protection  
features are provided.  
3\. Another limitation of these provisions regarding travel distance within covered mall  
buildings is also illustrated by Figure 402-7. In this instance, if the path of travel is  
through a secondary means of egress door from tenant space B to an exit \(in this case an  
exit passageway\), travel distance is not limited once the exit is reached.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 402-7 Travel distance.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation4\. In the case of exiting via the corridor as depicted for tenant space A, the total travel  
distance is limited to 200 feet \(60,960 mm\). This limitation is based on the consideration  
that a corridor does not offer as much protection as either an exit \(such as an exit  
passageway\) or the mall.  
For an open mall building, travel from an individual tenant space to the mall is  
addressed in the same manner as for a covered mall building. Once the open mall is  
reached, travel to the perimeter line is then regulated.  
402.8.6 Access to exits. This section uses the same approach as does Chapter 10 of requiring that  
the means of egress be arranged so that the occupants may go in either direction to a separate  
exit. However, in this section the dead end is measured in a manner similar to that of Exception 3  
of Section 1020.5. Figure 402-8 shows the manner in which dead-end conditions are regulated.  
Figure 402-8 Dead-end mall criteria.  
Regardless of the occupant load served, the minimum width of an exit passageway or corridor  
from a mall is to be 66 inches \(1,676 mm\). The exit passageway shown in Figure 402-9 must be  
at least 66 inches \(1,676 mm\) wide. The main entrances shown in the same figure are not subject  
to this requirement insofar as the required capacity of Section 1005.3 will most often require a  
greater exit width.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 402-9 Exit passageway width and capacity.  
Another exiting provision that is unique to a covered or open mall building regards exit  
passageway enclosures. Section 402.8.7 allows mechanical and electrical equipment rooms,  
building service areas, and service elevators to open directly into exit passageways, provided the  
minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated separation is maintained.  
402.8.8 Security grilles and doors. Quite often, mall tenants wish to have the dividing plane  
between the mall and the tenant space completely open during business hours. Horizontal sliding  
or vertical security grilles or doors are usually placed across this opening. This section permits  
their use, provided they do not detract from safe exiting from the tenant space into the mall. To  
secure that intent, the code requires four limitations outlined in this section.  
Section 403 High-Rise Buildings  
This section encompasses special life-safety requirements for high-rise buildings. The  
comparatively good fire record notwithstanding, particularly in office buildings, fires in high-rise  
buildings have prompted government at all levels to develop special regulations concerning life  
safety in high-rise buildings. The potential for disaster that is due to the large number of  
occupants in high-rise buildings has resulted in the provisions included in this section.  
The high-rise building is characterized by several features\:  
1\. It is impractical, if not impossible, to completely evacuate the building within a  
reasonable period of time.  
2\. Prompt rescue will be difficult, and the probability of fighting a fire in upper stories from  
the exterior will be low.  
3\. High-rise buildings are occupied by large numbers of people, and in certain occupancies  
the occupants may be asleep during an emergency.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation4\. A potential exists for stack effect. The stack effect can result in the distribution of smoke  
and other products of combustion throughout the height of a high-rise building during a  
fire.  
The provisions in this section are designed to account for the features described above.  
403.1 Applicability. Although a high-rise building can be defined in accordance with the special  
features just described, the IBC elects to define a high-rise building in Section 202 as one having  
one or more floors used for human occupancy located more than 75 feet \(22,860 mm\) above the  
lowest level of fire department vehicle access.  
This section identifies those types of buildings and structures to which the provisions for  
high-rise buildings do not apply due to their unique characteristics. It is inappropriate and  
unnecessary for the special safeguards established to address the typical high-rise condition to  
apply to these exempted structures. Included in this group of structures are aircraft-traffic control  
towers, open parking garages, portions of buildings containing Group A-5 occupancies, special  
industrial occupancies, and buildings housing specific Group H-1, H-2, and H-3 occupancies.  
403.2 Construction. Primarily because a sprinklered high-rise building is provided with an  
increased level of fire protection supervision and control, the IBC permits certain modifications  
of the code requirements, which are sometimes referred to as trade-offs. The trade-offs for  
construction type are considered to be justified on the basis that the sprinkler system, although a  
mechanical system, is highly reliable because of the provisions that require supervisory initiating  
devices and water-flow initiating devices for every floor. In addition, a secondary on-site supply  
of water is mandated for those high-rise buildings subject to a moderate to high level of seismic  
risk.  
This section permits some degree of reduction in the required fire-resistance ratings of  
building elements required to be protected on account of type of construction. In the evaluation  
of the maximum allowable height and area permitted for the building, the original construction  
type would remain applicable. For example, a building classified as Type IB and regulated as  
Type IB throughout the code would only need to meet the fire-resistive requirements of Table  
601 for a building of Type IIA construction \(in other than Group F-1, H-2, H-3, H-5, M, and S-1  
occupancies\).  
In addition to the reductions permitted for building elements identified in Table 601 based on  
the building’s type of construction, the fire-resistance rating of shaft enclosures may be reduced  
to 1 hour where sprinklers are installed within the shafts at the top and at alternative floor levels.  
The reduction in fire-resistance ratings is not applicable in all cases. In all high-rise buildings  
of Type IA construction, the 3-hour rating for structural columns supporting floors must be  
maintained. The critical role of columns in the structural integrity of a high-rise structure during  
fire conditions mandates that their fire resistance not be lessened. For buildings that exceed 420  
feet \(128 m\) in height, no reduction to the required fire resistance of any building elements is  
permitted, and the required vertical shaft protection cannot be reduced from the general 2-hour  
requirement. The increased risk of catastrophic damage associated with these very tall buildings  
requires an increased level of fire resistance.  
403.3 Automatic sprinkler system. The automatic fire-sprinkler system required by Section  
403.3 must be completely reliable, as must the other life-safety systems. As part of that reliability  
effort, a high-rise building must be provided with a secondary water supply where required by  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSection 403.3.3. In Seismic Design Category C, D, E, or F, an on-site automatic secondary water  
supply shall be provided, with a supply of water equal to the hydraulically calculated sprinkler  
design demand, including the hose stream requirement, for a duration of at least 30 minutes. As  
fires can \(and do\) break out as a result of earthquake damage to the various mechanical systems  
within a building, it is imperative that the reliability of the sprinkler system be such that any  
resulting fires can be automatically extinguished.  
403.4 Emergency systems. Among the more important life-safety features required by the code  
are the alarm and communications systems required by this section. Where it is expected that  
people will be unable to evacuate the building, it is imperative that they be informed as to the  
nature of any emergency that may break out, as well as the proper action to take to exit to a safe  
place of refuge. Furthermore, a system is necessary in most cases to provide for communication  
between the fire officer in charge at the scene and the fire fighters throughout the building.  
Section 911 provides details of the required fire command center utilized by the fire department  
to coordinate fire suppression and rescue operations.  
In order to provide for efficient and reliable communications among fire fighters, police  
officers, medical personnel, and other emergency responders, an in-building two-way emergency  
responder communications system must be installed in all high-rise buildings. The details for  
such systems are established in Section 510 of the International Fire Code® \(IFC®\). IFC Section  
510.4.1 specifies that acceptable radio coverage is satisfied when 95 percent of all areas on each  
floor of the building meet the signal strength requirements in Sections 510.4.1.1 through  
510.4.1.3 for signals transmitted into and out of a building. Additionally, at least 99 percent of all  
areas designated as critical areas by the fire code official must meet these requirements.  
In addition, one of the fire department’s duties during a fire event is to expel the smoke after  
the fire has occurred. Three methods for smoke exhaust are available\: through natural means,  
through the use of mechanical air-handling equipment, or through an equivalency approach.  
Where the method of natural ventilation is used for the removal of smoke, openable windows or  
panels are required to be distributed around the perimeter of each floor level. The fire  
departments can open the appropriate windows as necessary and provide pressurization through  
the use of fans. The use of fixed tempered glass panels is also acceptable if they are not coated in  
a manner that will modify the natural breaking characteristics of the glass. Where mechanical air-  
handling equipment is used for smoke removal purposes, the building’s HVAC system is  
equipped with appropriate dampers at each floor that are arranged in a manner that will stop the  
recirculation of air through the use of 100 percent fresh air intake and outside exhaust. The panel  
for controlling this system is to be located in the building’s fire command center. In addition, the  
building official has the authority to approve any other means of smoke removal provided it  
accomplishes the intended goal of the prescriptive mechanical or natural ventilation approaches  
described by the code. See Figure 403-1. It must be noted that this smoke exhaust system is for  
fire department use only and is not intended to be a part of the occupant-related life-safety  
systems placed in high-rise buildings.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 403-1 Smoke removal.  
Furthering the intent of the IBC that life-safety systems in high-rise buildings be highly  
reliable, the code requires that the power supply to the life-safety systems be regulated by the  
appropriate provisions of NFPA 70, more specifically, Articles 700 and 701. The basis of the  
reliability is that the building’s power be automatically transferable to a standby or emergency  
power system in the event of the failure of the normal power supply. Those standby power loads  
required by the code include power and lighting for the fire command center, ventilation and  
automatic fire detection equipment for smokeproof enclosures, and elevators.  
The code further requires that lighting for exit signs, means of egress illumination, and  
elevator car lighting be automatically transferable to an emergency power system capable of  
operation within 10 seconds of the failure of the normal power supply. Additionally, all  
emergency voice/alarm communications systems, automatic fire detection systems, fire alarm  
systems, and electrically powered fire pumps are to be provided with emergency power.  
403.5.1 Remoteness of interior exit stairways. The general requirements for separation of exit  
or exit access doorways as established in Sections 1007.1.1 and 1007.1.2 are supplemented in  
this section by adding a minimum required separation distance between the enclosures for  
interior exit stairways. In addition to maintaining a minimum separation between the doors to the  
enclosures of one-third the length of the overall diagonal dimension of the area served, the  
interior exit stairways must be located at least 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) apart or not less than one-  
fourth the diagonal dimension, whichever is less. See Figure 403-2. If three or more interior exit  
stairway enclosures are mandated, at least two of the enclosures must be separated as indicated.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 403-2 Remoteness of exit enclosures.  
403.5.2 Additional exit stairway. During a fire that requires a full evacuation of a building of  
extensive height, the fire-fighting operations will reduce the capacity of the egress system. The  
extended period of time needed to fully evacuate a very tall building means that people will still  
be evacuating while full fire-fighting operations are taking place. Sound high-rise fire-fighting  
doctrine provides that the fire department take control of one stair, the one most appropriate to  
the circumstances of the given fire condition. This can result in a significant reduction in egress  
capacity of the stairway system. For example, in order to conduct suppression activities in a  
building with two required stairs of the same width, one-half of the exit capacity is unavailable  
while the building is still being evacuated. An additional stair is required so that egress capacity  
will be maintained through the time that full evacuation is complete.  
It is important to note that this additional stair is not required to be a dedicated fire department  
stair. The fire department should be able to choose the stair that is most appropriate for the actual  
fire event. As a result, it will be necessary for emergency responders to manage evacuation flow  
to the available stairs.  
The application of this requirement is limited to only those buildings over 420 feet \(128 m\) in  
height. In addition, it does not apply to Group R-2 occupancies and their ancillary spaces due to  
the limited occupant load of such uses. In determining if the required egress capacity is provided  
by the stairway system, it must be assumed that the widest of the stairways is the one that is  
unavailable for means of egress travel. The remaining stairways must be sized to accommodate  
the total required egress capacity. The additional stairway’s sole purpose is to provide additional  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationegress capacity. Therefore, other means of egress design issues, such as travel distance and exit  
separation, are not regulated.  
The additional exit stairway is not required where occupant evacuation elevators are provided  
in accordance with Section 3008. The availability of elevators for evacuation purposes provides  
for a reasonable alternative to an additional stairway.  
403.5.3 Stairway door operation. In those cases where it is impractical to totally evacuate the  
occupants from the building through the stairway system, it must be possible to move the  
occupants to different floors of the building that are safe by way of the stairway system. For this  
to happen, the doors to the interior exit stairway enclosures must either be unlocked or be  
designed for automatic unlocking from the fire command station.  
The IBC further requires that a telephone or other two-way communication system \(such as a  
two-way system with speaker and microphone\) be located at every fifth floor in each required  
stair enclosure for those cases where the stair enclosure doors are to be locked. Moreover, the  
code requires that this communication system be connected to an approved station that is  
constantly attended. Thus, anyone trapped in the stairway during a nonfire emergency may call  
for help without traversing more than two levels. In the case of office buildings and apartment  
houses, the attended station may be considered the office of the building as long as the office has  
continuous attendance by responsible individuals who are familiar with the life-safety systems.  
For hotel buildings, the most likely choice for the attendance station will probably be the hotel  
telephone operators, and, again, they must be trained to assist the persons trapped within the stair  
enclosure.  
403.5.4 Smokeproof enclosures. Those interior exit stairway enclosures in a high-rise building  
that serve floor levels located more than 75 feet \(22,860 mm\) above the lowest level of fire  
department vehicle access must be designed as smokeproof enclosures. Exit stairways that do not  
serve floors above the height indicated are not regulated by this section. Section 1023.12  
regulates the access, extension, and termination relating to the utilization of smokeproof  
enclosures and pressurized stairways as a part of the means of egress system. Section 909.20  
provides the construction and ventilation criteria for smokeproof enclosures, as well as  
establishing stair pressurization as an acceptable alternative.  
403.5.5 Luminous egress path markings. In high-rise buildings, increased visibility for travel  
on stairways and through exit passageways is important due to the extreme conditions that may  
be encountered under emergency conditions. The use of photoluminescent or self-illuminating  
materials to delineate the exit path is required in high-rise buildings housing Group A, B, E, I-1,  
M, and R-1 occupancies. Specific requirements related to these egress path markings are set forth  
in Section 1025 and include the regulation of striping on steps, landings, and handrails; perimeter  
demarcation lines on the floor and walls, including their transition; acceptable materials; and  
illumination periods. An example of such markings is shown in Figure 403-3.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 403-3 Luminous egress path markings.  
403.6 Elevators. In order to facilitate the rapid deployment of fire fighters, at least two fire  
service access elevators are required in high-rise buildings that have an occupied floor more than  
120 feet \(36,576 mm\) above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access. Usable by fire  
fighters and other emergency responders, the specific requirements for the elevators are set forth  
in Section 3007. There are a number of key features that allow fire fighters to use the elevator for  
safely accessing an area of a building that may be involved in a fire. A complying lobby is  
required adjacent to the elevator hoistway opening, creating a protected area from which to stage  
operations. Access to standpipe hose valves is required, as are two-way communication features.  
A single fire service access elevator is permitted in the unlikely situation where a building  
regulated by this section has only one elevator.  
The mandate for multiple fire service access elevators is based on information that indicates at  
least two elevators are necessary for fire-fighting activities in high-rise buildings. In addition,  
past experience has shown that on many occasions elevators are not available due to shutdowns  
for various reasons, including problems in operation, routine maintenance, modernization  
programs, and EMS operations in the building prior to firefighter arrival. A minimum of two fire  
service elevators provided with all of the benefits afforded to such elevators better ensures that  
there will be a fire service access elevator available for the fire fighters’ use in the performance  
of their duties.  
A more comprehensive discussion of the requirements for fire service access elevators is  
found in the analysis of Section 3007.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe use of elevators as an evacuation element for occupants of a high-rise building is possible  
provided the elevators are in compliance with the requirements established in Section 3008. The  
controls and safeguards provided in Section 3008 create a suitable environment to allow  
complying elevators to be used for occupant self-evacuation purposes. The presence of such  
elevators does not reduce the general means of egress requirements established in Chapter 10;  
however, the additional exit stairway mandated for very tall high-rise buildings by Section  
403.5.2 is no longer required. It is important to note that the installation of occupant evacuation  
elevators in high-rise buildings is not mandated by the code; however, such elevators are  
permitted for use for occupant self-evacuation and may be utilized as an alternative to the  
additional stairway requirement.  
Section 404 Atriums  
This section was developed to fill a need for code provisions applicable to the trends in the  
architectural design of buildings where the designer makes use of an atrium. Prior to the early  
1980s, building codes did not provide for atriums, and, moreover, atriums were prohibited  
because of the requirements for protection of vertical openings. They were, however, permitted  
on an individual basis, usually under the provisions in the administrative sections of the code  
permitting alternative designs and alternative methods of construction. The general concept of  
alternative protection is to provide for both the equivalence of an open court and at the same time  
provide protection somewhat equivalent to shaft protection to prevent products of combustion  
from being spread throughout the building via the atrium.  
Unprotected vertical openings are often identified as the factors responsible for fire spread in  
incidents involving fire fatalities or extensive property damage. Section 404 addresses one  
method for protection of these specific building features in lieu of providing a complete floor  
separation. Where a conforming atrium is provided, it is considered as an equivalent degree of  
resistance to fire and smoke spread vertically from story to story. An atrium is defined in Section  
202 as “A vertical space that is closed at the top connecting two or more stories in Group I-2 and  
I-3 occupancies or three stories in all other occupancies.  
” The use of an atrium to protect vertical  
openings between stories is permitted in all occupancies except for Group H.  
The atrium allowance is one of the numerous options for addressing vertical openings as set  
forth in Sections 712.1.1 through 712.1.16. Atriums are identified in Section 712.7 and are  
considered acceptable when in compliance with the criteria of Section 404. Complying atriums  
are not to be considered unprotected vertical openings; rather, the vertical openings are protected  
by means other than enclosure by a shaft or a complete floor assembly. The provisions of Section  
404 are not intended to apply to conditions that are addressed by Section 712.1 based on the  
itemized options, other than when Section 712.1.7 is the chosen method of compliance. In other  
words, if compliance with Section 712.1 is achieved by applying one of the options other than an  
atrium as permitted by Section 712.1.7, then the provisions of Section 404 are not applicable.  
Conversely, if the provisions of Section 404 have been complied with, then the other options  
listed in Section 712 do not need to be applied.  
404.3 Automatic sprinkler protection. One of the basic requirements for atriums is that the  
building be provided with an automatic sprinkler system throughout. Two exceptions modify this  
general requirement. Those areas of the building adjacent to or above the atrium are not required  
to be sprinklered if appropriately separated from the atrium. This separation must consist of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationminimum 2-hour fire barriers, horizontal assemblies, or both. In addition, sprinkler protection is  
not required at an atrium ceiling located more than 55 feet \(16,764 mm\) above the atrium floor.  
404.5 Smoke control. Another major component of the life-safety system for a building  
containing an atrium is the required smoke-control system. The design of the smoke-control  
system is to be in accordance with Section 909. Although the exhaust method is typically used as  
the means of accomplishing smoke control, the code would not prohibit the use of the airflow or  
pressurization methods where shown to be suitable. One of these methods is often used where  
the ceiling height makes it difficult to maintain the smoke layer at least 6 feet \(1,829 mm\) above  
the floor of the means of egress.  
Applicable in other than Group I-2 and Group I-1, Condition 2 occupancies, Exception 1  
eliminates the requirement for smoke control in those atriums that connect only two stories.  
However, established in the atrium definition, where only two stories are open to each other in a  
Group I-1 occupancy the condition is not regulated under the provisions of Section 404.  
Therefore, the application of Exception 1 is limited solely to Group I-3 occupancies, recognizing  
that atriums in such buildings need not be provided with smoke control where only two stories  
are connected.  
Exception 2 allows an opening connecting multiple stories without the protection afforded by  
a smoke control system where two conditions are met. First, only the two lowest stories are  
permitted to be open to the atrium. Second, those stories located above the two lowest stories are  
required to be separated from the atrium with shaft enclosures having a minimum fire-resistance  
rating in compliance with Section 713.4. It is recognized that a combination vertical opening  
condition consisting of both an atrium and a shaft enclosure provides the necessary degree of  
separation expected between multiple stories, eliminating the need for a smoke control system.  
See Figure 404-1.  
Figure 404-1 Atrium enclosure.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation404.6 Enclosure of atriums. With some exceptions, an enclosure separation is required between  
the atrium and the remainder of the building. See Figure 404-2. The basic requirement is for a 1-  
hour fire-resistance-rated fire barrier with openings protected in accordance with Tables 716.1\(2\)  
and 716.1\(3\). This degree of enclosure, in addition to the other special conditions of Section 404,  
is intended to provide protection somewhat equivalent to the otherwise mandated shaft  
protection. Two alternative methods of atrium separation are described in the exception. The  
special sprinkler-wetted glass enclosure as depicted in Figure 404-3 provides a prescriptive  
method of achieving equivalency. In addition, the separation may consist of a ¾-hour-rated  
glass-block wall assembly.  
Figure 404-2 Atrium enclosure  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 404-3 Glass protection.  
The separation between adjacent spaces and the atrium may be omitted on a maximum of any  
three floor levels, provided the remaining floor levels are separated as provided in this section. In  
computing the atrium volume for the design of the smoke-control system, the volume of such  
open spaces shall be included. Where a smoke control system is not required, it is also  
unnecessary to provide the fire-resistive separation between the atrium and the adjoining spaces.  
Some form of a boundary is required to assist the required smoke control system in containing  
smoke to only the atrium area. Exceptions 5 and 6 to the enclosure requirements address  
conditions where escalators or exit access stairways penetrate a required horizontal assembly.  
These exceptions recognize that no horizontal assembly separation of the atrium is required at  
those locations where openings are created for such escalators or stairways provided compliance  
with Section 712.1.3.1 or Item 4 of Section 1019.3, respectively, is achieved. See Figure 404-4.  
It is anticipated that the presence of the draft curtains and sprinklers limit the potential of smoke  
spread through the opening; thus, such areas that only communicate via these specific openings  
should not be considered as an extension of the atrium.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 404-4 Openings in horizontal assemblies.  
Section 405 Underground Buildings  
Structures that have occupied floor levels well below ground level, and thus significantly below  
the level of fire personnel access from the exterior and building occupant discharge to the  
exterior, present special hazards that are specifically addressed in this section. Much like high-  
rise buildings, underground buildings can create difficult egress conditions as well as pose many  
problems for the fire department in their rescue and suppression activities. Fundamental to the  
protection features of this type of building are the requirements for Type I noncombustible  
construction and the installation of an automatic sprinkler system. A standpipe system is also  
required. For clarification, only the underground portion of the structure needs to be of Type I  
construction, and only those floor levels at the highest discharge level and below need to be  
sprinklered. See Figure 405-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 405-1 Underground buildings.  
The basic criterion for consideration as an underground building is that a floor level used for  
human occupancy be located more than 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) below the finished floor of the  
lowest level of exit discharge. Exempted from the requirements of Section 405 are sprinklered  
dwellings; parking garages having sprinkler protection; fixed guideway transit systems such as  
subways; stadiums, arenas, and similar assembly structures; those buildings where the lowest  
story is the only story that mandates compliance with Section 405 and the story's floor area and  
occupant load are very limited; and mechanical spaces that are typically unoccupied.  
A valuable concept in fire protection is utilized in the provisions for underground buildings  
that extend even deeper into the ground. Where an occupied floor level is located more than 60  
feet \(18,288 mm\) below the finished floor of the lowest level of exit discharge, at least two  
compartments of approximately equal size must be created. The compartmentation must extend  
throughout the underground portion of the structure, up to and including the highest level of exit  
discharge. The separation between the two areas is intended to allow for horizontal egress travel  
to a refuge area if necessary, while also permitting the use of the compartment as a staging area  
for fire-suppression activities. A smoke barrier is required as the separation element, with door  
openings also protected in a manner to restrict smoke leakage. Other openings and penetrations  
are strictly limited. Air supply and exhaust systems, where provided, must be independent of the  
other compartments. Where the underground portion of the building is served by elevators, each  
compartment must have access to at least one elevator. An elevator lobby, enclosed by a smoke  
barrier, may be used to allow a single elevator to serve more than one compartment. See Figure  
405-2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 405-2 Compartmentation of underground buildings.  
Smoke control is also an important part of the overall fire-protection package. By limiting the  
spread of smoke to only the originating area of the fire, the remainder of the underground  
building should be provided with acceptable egress paths. Each compartment shall be provided  
with its own smoke-control system. A manual fire-alarm system and complying communications  
system is also an integral part of the fire- and life-safety concept for underground buildings.  
Stairways serving the floor levels of an underground building that are more than 30 feet  
\(9,144 mm\) below the discharge level are to be smokeproof enclosures, with at least two means  
of egress from each floor level. If multiple compartments are formed, each compartment must  
have at least one exit, with a second egress path available into an adjoining compartment. It is  
mandatory that multiple exits be provided within enclosures designed to resist the penetration of  
smoke.  
Both standby and emergency power shall be provided to specific loads identified by this  
section. See the discussion of Section 403.4.  
Section 406 Motor-Vehicle-Related Occupancies  
Although uncommon, fire hazards related to motor vehicles are a concern, particularly where  
associated with other occupancies. The code regulates occupancies containing motor vehicles,  
whether they be parked, under repair, or being fueled. The hazards are primarily related to the  
plastic components and fuel in the vehicles, as the overall fire loading related to vehicle  
occupancies is typically low.  
406.2 Design. There are a number of provisions that are applicable to carports and the various  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationtypes of garages, regardless of their classification. To allow access for the parking of other than  
high-profile vehicles, the clear height of each floor level is to be at least 7 feet \(2,134 mm\). Note  
that the minimum height of the means of egress system is 7 feet, 6 inches \(2,286 mm\), based on  
the general provisions of Section 1003.2. However, Exception 7 to Section 1003.2 allows the  
clear height to be reduced to 7 feet \(2,134 mm\) in those areas of parking garages used for  
vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  
Where the parking garage is connected directly to a room containing a fuel-fired appliance, a  
vestibule is mandated to separate the two spaces. This provides at least two doorways to isolate  
the equipment from the vehicle area. The vestibule is not necessary where the appliance ignition  
sources are placed at least 18 inches \(457 mm\) above the floor. The International Mechanical  
Code® \(IMC®\) and/or International Fuel Gas Code® \(IFGC®\) should also be consulted for those  
requirements regulating the installation of mechanical equipment within parking garages.  
406.3 Private garages and carports. Where the amount of floor area devoted to vehicle parking  
is relatively small, the code recognizes the low hazard level by establishing a limited set of  
safeguards. In addition to the scope established by the definition of “private garage,  
” the  
maximum floor area per Group U garage is established at 1,000 square feet. Multiple Group U  
garages are permitted in the same building provided such garages are separated by minimum 1-  
hour fire barriers, with a maximum aggregate area per building based on the allowable building  
area provisions of Sections 503 and 506. Figure 406-1 illustrates an example of multiple garages  
located in a single building.  
Figure 406-1 Private garage floor area limits.  
406.4 Public parking garages. There are fundamentally two types of parking garages regulated  
by the IBC—private garages and public garages. Although there is no specific definition for  
public garage, the basis for both classifications is Section 406.3 addressing private garages and  
carports. Those parking structures that fall outside of the scope of Section 406.3 or the private  
garage definition in Chapter 2 are considered as public parking garages. The primary difference  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbetween private and public garages is typically the size of the facility, rather than the use. Strictly  
limited in permissible area per garage compartment, private parking garages serve only a specific  
tenant or building. It is important to note that there is no implication that public parking garages  
must be open to the public, as they are only considered public in comparison to private garages.  
A public parking garage is then further characterized as one of two types, either an enclosed  
parking garage or an open parking garage, and regulated accordingly. It is also permissible for a  
garage that is defined as a private garage to be regulated under the provisions for a public garage.  
Guards must be provided in accordance with the general provisions of Section 1015. In  
addition, all parking areas more than 12 inches \(305 mm\) above adjacent levels shall be provided  
with vehicle barriers at the ends of parking spaces and drive lanes. The height of the vehicle  
barriers cannot be less than 2 feet, 9 inches \(835 mm\).  
406.5 Open parking garages. Studies and tests of fires in open parking garages have shown  
that, in addition to limited fire loading, the potential for a large fire is uncommon. Based on this  
data, the IBC establishes special provisions for open parking garages in this section, which in  
general are less restrictive than those for enclosed parking structures addressed in Section 406.6.  
The key is that the open parking garage is well ventilated naturally, and as a result, the products  
of combustion dissipate rapidly and do not contribute to the spread of fire.  
To secure the proper amount of openness, the code, as illustrated in Figure 406-2, specifies  
the following\:  
Figure 406-2 Open parking garages.  
1\. The building must have openings on at least two sides.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. 3. The openings must be uniformly distributed along each side.  
The area of openings in the exterior walls on any given tier must be at least equal to 20  
percent of the wall area of the total perimeter of each tier.  
4\. Unless the required openings are uniformly distributed over two opposing sides of the  
building, the aggregate length of openings considered to provide natural ventilation shall  
constitute a minimum of 40 percent of the wall length of the perimeter of that tier.  
5\. The area of openings in the interior walls must be at least 20 percent of the area of the  
interior walls with openings uniformly distributed.  
There are situations where the required openings of open parking garages are located below  
the surrounding grade. Section 406.5.2.1 mandates that a clear horizontal space be provided  
adjacent to the garage’s exterior openings that allows for adequate air movement through the  
opening. The dimensional requirements are based on the provisions of Section 1202.5.1.2, which  
addresses openings below grade when such openings are used for the required natural ventilation  
of a building’s occupied spaces. Where openings in the exterior wall of an open parking garage  
are located below grade level, some degree of clear space must be provided at the exterior of the  
openings. As the distance of the openings below the adjoining ground increases, the minimum  
required exterior clear space also increases proportionately. The horizontal clear space  
dimension, measured perpendicular to the exterior wall opening, must be at least one and one-  
half times the distance between the bottom of the opening and the average adjoining ground level  
above. The extent of the required clear space allows for adequate exterior open space to meet the  
intent and dynamics of natural ventilation requirements for open parking garages. See Figure  
406-3.  
Figure 406-3 Parking garage openings below grade.  
As a general rule, the maximum allowable height and area of open parking garages is  
calculated in the same manner as for other buildings. Classified as a Group S-2 occupancy, the  
provisions of Chapter 5 would apply. However, where the open parking garage contains no uses  
other than the parking of private motor vehicles, the specific size limitations of Table 406.5.4  
and Section 406.5.5 take effect. Because the potential fire severity of an open parking structure  
used solely for vehicle parking is extremely low, the code permits area and height limitations in  
excess of those for other nonsprinklered Group S-2 occupancies. For example, a stand-alone  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationnonsprinklered open parking garage of Type IIB construction would be permitted a tabular floor  
area of up to 26,000 square feet \(2,415 m2\) per story if only based on Table 506.2, with a height  
limit of three stories. However, a tabular floor area of 50,000 square feet \(4,645 m2\) per tier is  
established in Table 406.5.4, with a height limit of eight tiers for a ramp-access garage. For such  
an open parking garage exceeding three stories in height, the total area of the multistory building  
is not limited to three times that for a one-story building, as is required by Section 506.2.3, but  
rather can be computed as the permitted area per tier times the number of tiers. Therefore, in the  
example just given, the total floor area permitted by Table 406.5.4 would be 400,000 square feet  
\(37,160 m2\) for a stand-alone Type IIB open parking garage. The maximum height in tiers has  
been limited somewhat arbitrarily by the code, based on the length of time it would take for fire-  
department personnel to reach the top of the structure for fire-suppression purposes.  
Where the Group S-2 single-use open parking garage is fully sprinklered, it may be a design  
disadvantage to apply Table 406.5.4 due to the lack of an allowable area increase for sprinkler  
protection. Because the use of Table 406.5.4 is voluntary, it may be advantageous from a design  
perspective to apply Table 506.2 for a sprinklered condition rather than Table 406.5.4 when the  
garage is limited to a single-use condition.  
The area and height increases above the tabular limits listed in Table 406.5.4 for single-use  
open parking garages are those outlined in Section 406.5.5, and are basically keyed to the  
provision of more natural ventilation area than the minimum required by the code. For unlimited-  
area buildings permitted by this section, see Figure 406-4.  
Figure 406-4 Unlimited area open parking garages.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIn the classification of a Group S-2 parking structure as an open parking garage, the code  
identifies the following prohibitions\:  
1\. 2. 3. There shall be no automobile repair work performed in the building.  
There shall be no parking of buses, trucks, or similar vehicles.  
There shall be no partial or complete closing of the required exterior wall openings by  
tarpaulins or by any other means.  
4\. There shall be no dispensing of fuel.  
The intent of these limitations is to further ensure low fire loading, low possibility of fire  
spread, and natural cross ventilation.  
406.6 Enclosed parking garages. Any vehicle parking garage that does not meet the criteria of  
an open parking garage or a Group U private garage is to be regulated under the general  
allowable height and area provisions for a Group S-2 occupancy. Tables 504.3, 504.4, and 506.2,  
along with any applicable height and area increases, will limit the height and floor area of an  
enclosed parking garage, with an allowance for use of the roof for parking purposes. A key  
requirement is that a mechanical ventilation system and exhaust system must be provided in  
accordance with the IMC.  
406.7 Motor-fuel-dispensing facilities. Because most of the hazards involved with a fuel-  
dispensing operation are due to the storage and dispensing of flammable liquids, the majority of  
regulations are addressed by the IFC. The primary provisions of this section apply to canopies  
that are placed over the fueling areas for the purpose of customer convenience. Because of the  
potential exposure of gasoline and vehicle fires during fuel-dispensing operations, the canopies  
and supports over pumps are required by this section to be of noncombustible construction or,  
alternatively, constructed of fire-retardant-treated wood, complying heavy-timber members, or  
be of 1-hour fire-resistance-rated combustible construction. Occasionally, combustible materials  
may be used in or on a canopy under limited conditions. The allowance for approved plastic  
panels installed in canopies over motor-vehicle pumps is intended to isolate the combustible  
plastic materials from other buildings so that if the materials become ignited, they will not  
present an exposure problem to such buildings.  
To avoid damage to vehicles and canopies, the clear height of canopies must not be less than  
13 feet, 6 inches \(4,115 mm\). The 13-foot, 6-inch \(4,115-mm\) dimension should provide  
adequate clearance for recreational vehicles.  
406.8 Repair garages. A repair garage is defined in Section 202 as any building or portion  
thereof that is used to service or repair motor vehicles. The potential exists for a moderate fire  
hazard that is due to the presence of various combustible and flammable liquids such as solvents,  
cleaning products, and gasoline. During repair operations, it is also not uncommon for ignition  
sources to be present. It is this combination of hazards that creates the need for the provisions of  
Section 406.8. Classified as Group S-1 occupancies, special concerns for repair garages are  
primarily regulated through the IFC.  
The presence of a repair garage in a building with different types of uses is addressed no  
differently than other mixed-occupancy conditions. The provisions of Section 508.1 are  
applicable, allowing the option of using the accessory occupancies, nonseparated occupancies,  
or separated occupancies method for addressing the multiple occupancy groups in the building.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 407 Group I-2  
In institutional occupancies, particularly those classified as Group I-2, it is important to balance  
the fire-safety concerns with the functional concerns of the health-care operations. This section  
modifies the general code provisions in an effort to achieve such a balance.  
407.2 Corridors continuity and separation. Corridors are intended to provide a direct egress  
path adequately separated from hazards in adjoining spaces. However, in hospitals, nursing  
homes, and other Group I-2 occupancies, a number of necessary modifications are provided to  
facilitate the primary functioning of these types of health-care facilities. These modifications  
recognize the special needs of these occupancies to provide the most efficient and effective  
health-care services. See Figure 407-1.  
Figure 407-1 Corridors in Group I-2 occupancies.  
In order to provide appropriate waiting spaces for visitors, Section 407.2.1 allows such  
waiting spaces to be unseparated from the corridors. One reason for this is to permit the waiting  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationareas and similar spaces to be so located as to permit direct visual supervision by health-care  
facility staff. In exchange for the elimination of the corridor separation, certain conditions are  
imposed on the location of such waiting spaces. Although the scoping language only includes  
waiting areas and similar spaces, the primary criteria limiting those spaces that can be open to a  
corridor would seem to be identified in Item 1. Health-care facilities will often create alcoves  
adjacent to the corridor for the temporary storage of medical supplies, linen carts, food carts, etc.,  
that are necessary to the daily functions of the facility. Without the alcoves, the corridors would  
be obstructed by these uses. Therefore, the code makes an allowance for such spaces.  
Allowances are also made for areas associated with the treatment of mental-health patients.  
Provided the areas are under continuous supervision by facility staff, they may be open to the  
corridor where six conditions are met as established in Section 407.2.3.  
Similarly, Section 407.2.2 makes provisions for the location of clerical stations and other  
spaces necessary for doctors’ and nurses’ charting and communications in positions that need not  
be separated from the corridors. Essentially, these special-use areas are permitted to be located in  
the corridor. When this arrangement occurs, however, it is necessary that the construction  
surrounding the clerical station be as that required for corridors.  
In nursing home environments, residents are encouraged to spend time outside of their rooms.  
By providing a variety of shared living spaces open to the circulation/means-of-egress system,  
socialization and interaction are encouraged. Further, being able to preview activities that are  
occurring helps to encourage interaction and allows reluctant participants to join at their own  
pace. Finally, a more open plan allows staff to more easily monitor residents throughout the day.  
For these reasons, it is important that the physical separation of shared resident spaces from  
corridors be eliminated. The conditions established in Section 407.2.5, some of which are  
represented in Figure 407-2, provide the means for recognizing the benefits of openness while  
also maintaining an appropriate level of egress protection.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 407-2 Group I-2 shared living space.  
Another allowance for eliminating the separation between a corridor and surrounding spaces  
addresses areas with cooking facilities. A part of the desired group environment is also a  
functioning kitchen that can also serve as the hearth of the nursing home. Instead of a large,  
centralized, institutional kitchen where all meals are prepared and delivered to a central dining  
room of the resident’s room, the new “household model” nursing home uses decentralized  
kitchens and small dining areas to create and focus the feeling of home. Allowing kitchens that  
serve a small, defined group of residents to be open to common spaces and corridors is viewed as  
critically important to enhancing the feeling and memories of home for older adults. Figure 407-  
3 identifies several of the six conditions set forth in Section 407.2.6 that must be met where this  
alternative approach is utilized. Condition 6 references Section 407.2.7 that establishes  
requirements specific to the installation of the domestic cooking appliances installed in the  
facility.  
407.3 Corridor wall construction. Walls enclosing corridors and other spaces permitted by  
Section 407.2 to be open into corridors are intended to provide a relatively smoke-free  
environment during the relocation of patients during a fire emergency. Therefore, such walls  
must be constructed in accordance with the provisions of Section 710 as smoke partitions. The  
walls may extend either tight to the floor or roof deck above, or extend tight to the ceiling,  
provided the ceiling is also constructed to limit smoke transfer.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 407-3 Group I-2 domestic cooking facilities.  
Corridor doors protecting those spaces adjacent to the corridor are not required to have a fire-  
protection rating, nor are they required to be self-closing assemblies. They must, however, be  
able to limit the transfer of smoke through the opening but need not be tested for air leakage  
under UL 1784. One of the most controversial issues relative to the arrangement of health-care  
facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes is the matter of the installation of door closers on  
doors to patient sleeping rooms. The health-care industry has long believed it is more important  
to the proper delivery of health-care services that the doors to patient rooms not be self-closing  
and therefore constantly closed. In recognition of this special need, self-closing or automatic-  
closing devices are not required on corridor doors. Positive latching is required, however, and  
roller latches are not considered acceptable latching hardware. Where positive latching is not  
desired, typically where sliding doors are installed at patient or treatment rooms, the common  
corridor arrangement cannot be utilized. In such instances, the spaces could be designed as care  
suites under the provisions of Section 407.4.4. Corridor-type configurations within such suites  
are not subject to the requirements of Section 407.3.  
Locking devices may be arranged so that they are readily operable from the patient-room side  
and are readily operable by the facility staff from the opposite side. This special arrangement  
permits keys or other limited access methods to be utilized for the care recipient rooms.  
However, egress from the care recipient rooms shall be unrestricted unless such rooms are in  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmental-health facilities or regulated as controlled egress doors per Section 1010.2.14.  
407.4.4 Group I-2 care suites. Special means of egress provisions are provided for care suites in  
Group I-2 occupancies. The definition of “care suite” in Section 202 identifies the scope of such  
special provisions. The concept of suites recognizes those arrangements where staff must have  
more supervision of patients in specific treatment and sleeping rooms. Therefore, the general  
means of egress requirements are not appropriate under such conditions. The special allowances  
for suites are not intended to apply to day rooms or business functions of the health-care facility.  
407.5 Smoke barriers. Evacuation of a building such as a hospital or nursing home is a virtual  
impossibility in the event of a fire, particularly in multistory structures. Horizontal evacuation,  
on the other hand, is possible with a properly trained staff. As a result, the code makes provisions  
for horizontal compartmentation as illustrated in Figure 407-4, so that if necessary, care  
recipients can be moved from one compartment to another. This intent is secured by this section  
wherein, under most conditions, each story of a Group I-2 occupancy is required to be divided  
into at least two smoke compartments by a smoke barrier constructed in accordance with Section  
709\. Limited by floor area and travel distance, each compartment shall be sized to permit the  
housing of patients from adjoining smoke compartments. It is expected that in multistory  
buildings, the floor construction also provides for smoke compartmentation vertically. As such,  
the concept of smoke resistance must be considered relative to vertical openings and  
penetrations, including interior exit stairways and shaft enclosures.  
Figure 407-4 Hospital compartmentation.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation407.10 Secured yards. It is not uncommon that a secured exterior area or yard be provided for  
Group I-2 occupancies, particularly where the facility specializes in the treatment of mental  
disabilities such as Alzheimer’s disease. Where such fencing and locked gates prohibit the  
continuation of the exit discharge to the public way, the use of safe dispersal areas is acceptable.  
To adequately provide for temporary refuge, the safe dispersal area must be sized to  
accommodate the occupant load of the egress system it serves. In all cases, the entire dispersal  
area must be located at least 50 feet \(15,240 mm\) from the building.  
Section 408 Group I-3  
The concerns for both security and fire safety must be balanced when it comes to Group I-3  
detention facilities. Special consideration must be given to the secured areas without sacrificing  
an unreasonable degree of fire and life safety for the occupants. This section addresses the  
unique conditions that occur in these types of buildings.  
Section 408.3 modifies the general requirements for the means of egress found in Chapter 10.  
A major difference is the allowance for glazing in the doors and walls of interior exit stairways,  
provided a number of conditions are met. As would be expected, the most dramatic variation  
from the general requirements has to do with the locking hardware. The requirements vary based  
on the nature of the detention occupancy. Reference must occasionally be made to the occupancy  
conditions of Section 308.4 to determine the appropriate egress criteria.  
Similar to the provisions of Section 407 for Group I-2 occupancies, smoke compartments  
must be created where the occupant load per story is 50 or more. Additionally, regardless of  
occupant load, floor levels utilized as sleeping areas must be divided into a minimum of two  
compartments. More than two smoke compartments may be necessary on any floor level where  
the dictated travel distances cannot be provided or where the occupant load of the compartment  
is excessive. No more than 200 occupants can be assigned to a single compartment. The refuge  
area must be sized to accommodate the total number of residents that may be contained within  
the compartment. Independent egress is needed from each compartment so that it is not  
necessary to travel back into the compartment where travel originated.  
An important feature of the Group I-3 provisions is the allowance for multiple floor levels of  
residential housing to be open to each other without an enclosure. Through the safeguards  
provided, it is possible to provide increased security by opening up the multiple housing areas to  
a single common area where visual supervision is more easily accomplished. It is important that  
independent egress to an exit be provided from each level. The limit of 23 feet \(7,010 mm\)  
between the lowest and highest floor levels, as well as the required egress directly out of each  
story, provides additional qualifications that must be met in order to eliminate the required  
vertical enclosure protection.  
As an additional allowance for security purposes, the fire-protection rating is not required for  
security glazing installed in 1-hour fire barriers, fire partitions, and smoke barriers that may be  
present. Rather, equivalent protection is provided through compliance with four specific  
conditions addressing the glazing and its frame. The use of security glazing is necessary in such  
facilities to track and contain inmate movement for the protection of other inmates and  
administrative personnel. Three of the most common types of fire separations are addressed\: fire  
barriers, fire partitions, and smoke barriers. The allowance is not applicable to fire walls, nor is it  
permissible where the fire separation wall has a required fire-resistance rating of more than 1  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationhour. The conditions imposed on the security glazing limit the area of each individual glazed  
panel, mandate sprinkler protection that will wet the entire glazing surface on both sides, regulate  
the gasketed frame for deflection, and prohibit the installation of obstructions between the  
sprinklers and the glazing.  
Section 409 Motion-Picture Projection Rooms  
Prior to the 1970s, building codes addressed the subject of motion picture projection rooms  
based on the hazard of the cellulose nitrate film being used at that time. Actually, production of  
cellulose nitrate film ceased around 1950, although its use continued thereafter. In fact, even  
today, some cellulose nitrate film is used at film festivals and special occasions requiring the  
projection of historically significant films that are still imprinted on cellulose nitrate film. Where  
this type of film continues to be utilized or stored, it will be regulated under the provisions of  
NFPA 40. Although the provisions in the codes since 1970 are based on the use of safety film,  
some of the protection requirements for cellulose nitrate film have been retained in the present  
requirements, such as ventilation requirements for the projection room.  
The intent of the current provisions regulating motion picture projection rooms is to provide  
safety to the occupants of a theater from the hazards consequent on the light source where  
electric arc, xenon, or other light-source projection equipment is used. Although not used to any  
extent today, electric-arc projection lamps emit hazardous radiation. Xenon lamps, which have  
been highly prevalent as projection lamps, emit ozone. As a result, the provisions of Section 409  
are based on the lamps used for projection of the film rather than the type of film to be used, as  
long as the film is not nitrate based.  
The provisions intend to isolate the projection room so that it does not present a danger to the  
theater audience. As the room is designed for the projection of safety film, there is no intent to  
provide a special fire-resistive enclosure, and fire protection of openings between the projection  
room and the auditorium is not required. However, due to the projection lamps, it is the intent of  
the code to provide an emission-tight separation so that any opening should be sealed with glass  
or other approved material such that emissions from the projection lamps will not contaminate  
the auditorium.  
Section 410 Stages, Platforms, and Technical Production  
# Areas  
The provisions in Section 410 are continuously reviewed in an attempt to bring the code  
requirements in line with the present methods and technologies regarding the use of stages and  
platforms, as well as related accessory and support areas. Although the basic provisions for life  
safety have remained essentially unchanged over the years, occasional modifications have been  
made that are due to the need to accommodate state-of-the-art performances.  
It is critical that the definitions found in Chapter 2 related to Section 410 are reviewed in  
order to properly apply the provisions. There are terms unique to the performing arts that are not  
generally understood, such as fly gallery, gridiron, and pinrail, which fall under the general term  
“technical production area.  
” The distinctions between the definitions of a stage and a platform  
are also very important because of the specific requirements for each. The primary difference  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbetween a stage and a platform is the presence of overhead hanging curtains, drops, scenery, and  
other stage effects. The amount of combustible materials associated with a stage is typically  
considerably greater than that for a platform. Thus, the fire-severity potential is much higher.  
410.2 Stages. An assembly occupancy considered among the most hazardous is a Group A-1  
containing a large occupant load and a performance stage. The hazard created by the stage is the  
presence of combustibles in the form of hanging curtains, drops, leg drops, scenery, etc., which  
in the past have been the source of ignition for disastrous fires in theaters. Modern stages also  
have an increased hazard from special effects such as pyrotechnics, utilized in so-called  
spectaculars.  
Where the stage height exceeds 50 feet \(15,240 mm\), the fire hazard is even greater because  
the fly area that is usually above the stage is a large blind space containing combustible materials  
that have a fuel load considerably greater than that normally associated with an assembly  
occupancy. Many of the construction requirements for stages are depicted in Figure 410-1.  
Figure 410-1 Stages.  
410.2.1 Stage construction. In addition to the features shown in Figure 410-1, any stage may  
have a finished floor of wood, provided construction of the stage floor or deck is in compliance  
with this section. As the area above and at the sides of stages can be filled with combustible  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmaterials that can be moved both vertically and horizontally, such as curtains, drops, leg drops,  
scenery, and other stage effects, the code requires that such stages be constructed of the same  
materials as required for floors for the type of construction of the building and separated from the  
balance of the building.  
410.2.4 Proscenium wall. Where the stage height exceeds 50 feet \(15,240 mm\), measured from  
the lowest point on the stage floor to the highest point of the roof or floor deck above, a  
proscenium wall must be provided. The proscenium wall is intended by the IBC to provide a  
complete fire separation between the stage and the auditorium. Extending from the foundation  
continuously to the roof, the wall is to have a minimum fire-resistance rating of 2 hours.  
410.2.5 Proscenium curtain. Because the opening in the proscenium wall described in Section  
410.2.4 is too large to protect with any usual type of fire assembly, the code requires that it be  
protected with a fire-resistive fire curtain or water curtain. Where a fire curtain is installed, it  
must comply with the provisions for fire-safety curtains set forth in NFPA 80 Fire Doors and  
Other Opening Protectives. A fire curtain or water curtain is not required where a complying  
smoke-control system or natural ventilation is provided. Horizontal sliding doors may also be  
used to provide the required separation provided they have a minimum 1-hour fire protection  
rating.  
The purpose of the proscenium curtain protection is to provide occupants with additional time  
to exit the assembly seating area if there is a fire in the stage area. With the benefits afforded by  
an engineered smoke-control system or natural ventilation, the occupants should be equally or  
better protected from the hazards of fire than with a proscenium curtain or water curtain. By  
providing a performance-based alternative to a proscenium curtain, more design options are  
available where the use of fire-safety curtains is considered impractical or causes obstructions of  
the production. It is important to note that the elimination of the proscenium curtain is not  
permitted if the smoke-protected assembly seating provisions of Section 1030.6.2 are being  
utilized, for example, a decrease in the required egress widths of the assembly seating area.  
The requirement for a complying fire curtain is triggered solely by the proscenium wall  
provisions of Section 410.2.4. Where a proscenium wall is fire-resistance rated for solely a  
different purpose, such as a bearing wall in a Type IB building, the fire curtain is not required.  
410.2.7 Stage ventilation. The Iroquois Theater fire in 1903 was directly responsible for the  
requirement for automatic vents in the roofs of theater stages. Because of the presence of large  
amounts of combustible materials, excessive quantities of smoke will accumulate in and above  
the stage area unless it is automatically vented or removed by a smoke-control system. The  
removal of smoke is necessary for fire fighting as well as the prevention of panic by drawing off  
the smoke so that it will not infiltrate the theater auditorium.  
The maximum floor area of stages that is permitted without the installation of venting is 1,000  
square feet \(93 m2\). The stage area to be considered includes the performance area and adjacent  
backstage and support areas not separated from the performance area by fire-resistance-rated  
construction. In addition, stages must be equipped with smoke-removal equipment or roof vents  
where they are greater than 50 feet \(15,240 mm\) in height. If either of these two conditions exist,  
stage ventilation is required. The detailed requirements for smoke vents in the IBC are intended  
to provide reliability and a reasonable assurance that after many years of operation the vents will  
operate when needed.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation410.3 Platform construction. Materials used in the construction of permanent platforms must be  
consistent with those materials permitted based on the building’s type of construction. Therefore,  
in noncombustible buildings, the platforms must be of noncombustible construction. However, in  
buildings of Type I, II, and IV construction, the use of fire-retardant-treated wood is permitted  
where all of the following conditions are met\:  
1\. 2. The platform is limited in height to 30 inches \(762 mm\) above the floor.  
The floor area of the platform does not exceed one-third the floor area of the room in  
which it is located.  
3\. The platform does not exceed 3,000 square feet \(279 m2\) in floor area.  
In those situations where the concealed area below the platform is to be used for storage or  
any purpose other than equipment, wiring, or plumbing, the floor construction of the platform is  
to be fire-resistance rated for a minimum of 1 hour. Otherwise, no protection of the platform  
floor is necessary.  
As it is often impractical to construct temporary platforms of fire-resistive materials, the code  
permits temporary platforms to be constructed of any materials, but restricts the use below the  
platform to that of electrical wiring or plumbing connected to platform equipment. Therefore, no  
storage of any kind is permitted beneath temporary platforms, primarily because of the potential  
for a fire to start and spread undetected.  
410.4 Dressing and appurtenant rooms. Not only must a stage exceeding 50 feet \(15,240 mm\)  
in height be separated from the adjoining seating area by a minimum 2-hour fire-resistance-rated  
proscenium wall, but such a separation is also required between the stage and all other portions  
of the building, including all related backstage areas. Dressing rooms, property rooms,  
workshops, storage rooms, and all other areas must be separated from the stage with minimum 2-  
hour fire-resistance-rated fire barriers and/or horizontal assemblies, and all openings must be  
appropriately protected. A minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated separation is required where the  
stage height does not exceed 50 feet \(15,240 mm\).  
In addition to their required fire separation from the stage, dressing rooms and all other  
related backstage areas must be separated from each other. One-hour fire-resistance-rated fire  
barriers and/or horizontal assemblies, along with opening protectives, satisfy the minimum  
requirements. The hazards caused by the significant fire loading that occurs in conjunction with  
stages are greatly reduced through the use of compartments.  
410.6 Automatic sprinkler system. One of the special areas mentioned in Table 903.2.11.6 that  
requires a suppression system is stages. The general requirement mandates the sprinklering of  
not only the stage area but also all support and backstage areas serving the stage. An automatic  
sprinkler system is an effective tool in limiting the exposure of a fire to the area of origin.  
Sprinklers are not required for a stage having both a small floor area and a low roof height.  
Under such conditions, the amount of combustibles in the stage area is typically very limited.  
Section 411 Special Amusement Areas  
The provisions of Section 411 are only applicable to those areas and buildings that are  
specifically identified in Section 202 as special amusement areas. Typically walk-through and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationride-through attractions at amusement parks, haunted houses, and escape rooms, such amusement  
areas are usually classified as Group A occupancies but should be classified as Group B where  
the occupant load is less than 50. The major factors contributing to the loss of life in fires in  
buildings with special amusement areas have been the failure to detect and extinguish the fire in  
its incipient stage, the ignition of synthetic foam materials and subsequent fire and smoke spread,  
and the difficulty of escape. Provisions for the detection of fires, the illumination of the exit path,  
and the sprinklering of the structures are required to protect the occupants in such structures.  
However, special amusement areas without walls or a roof are not required to comply with this  
section, provided they are designed to prevent smoke from accumulating in such areas.  
Approved smoke-detection and alarm systems are also required in buildings with special  
amusement areas. A provision of Section 411.6 is that on the activation of the system as  
described, an approved directional exit-marking system shall activate in those areas where the  
configuration of the space is such as to disguise the path and make the egress route not readily  
apparent.  
In addition to compliance with all provisions applicable to other special amusement areas,  
puzzle rooms \(escape rooms\) must also comply with one of three exiting methodologies as set  
forth in Section 411.5. The means of egress system shall either \(1\) comply with the applicable  
provisions based upon occupancy classification as established by Chapter 10, \(2\) gain building  
official approval of an alternative means of egress design, or \(3\) meet the performance goal of  
the exit being open and readily available upon recognition of an emergency condition.  
Section 412 Aircraft-Related Occupancies  
Because of the unique nature of occupancies related to aircraft manufacture, repair, storage, and  
even flight control, provisions have been developed to address the special conditions that may  
exist. Although the various uses fall into different occupancy classifications, they all have one  
thing in common—they are related to aircraft. Additional requirements related directly to  
aviation facilities are found in Chapter 20 of the IFC.  
412.2 Airport-traffic control towers. These provisions are intended to reconcile the differences  
between the life-safety needs of air-traffic control towers and the life-safety requirements in the  
body of the code. In developing these provisions, consideration was given to the inherent  
qualities of the use, which makes the general requirements of the IBC inappropriate. For  
example, air-traffic control personnel are required to undergo medical examinations to ensure  
they are of sound body and mind. Recognition was also given to the life-safety record of these  
uses and specific limitations, which are imposed on the allowable size, type of construction, etc.  
The provisions also require automatic smoke-detection systems.  
412.3 Aircraft hangars. Aircraft hangars are intended to be classified as Group S-1  
occupancies. All aircraft hangars are to be located at least 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) from any public  
way or lot line, providing adequate spatial separation for neighboring areas. It should be noted  
that the measurement is taken to the nearest point of any public way, not to the centerline as  
typically applied. Otherwise, their exterior walls must have a minimum 2-hour fire-resistance  
rating. The criteria of Section 412.3.1 are not applicable in the regulation of two or more hangars  
on the same lot as there is no reference to imaginary lines placed between hangars. Where such  
conditions occur, the general provisions of Section 705.3 and Table 705.5 are to be applied.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationBecause of the concerns about below-grade spaces under any facility where flammable and  
combustible liquids are commonly present, the code requires the hangar floor over a basement to  
be liquid and air tight with absolutely no openings. Floor surfaces must also be sloped to allow  
for drainage of any liquid spills.  
412.3.6 Fire suppression. In order to minimize the fire hazards associated with aircraft hangars,  
fire suppression is required based on the criteria of Table 412.3.6. The table determines the  
hangar classification \(Group I, II, or III\) to which the fire suppression must be designed in  
accordance with NFPA 409, Aircraft Hangars. The classification is based on the hangar’s type of  
construction and fire area size. Fire area size is based on the aggregate floor area bounded by  
minimum 2-hour fire-resistance-rated fire walls. For the purposes of hangar classification,  
ancillary uses located within the fire area are not required to be included in the fire area size  
provided they are separated from the aircraft serving area by minimum 1-hour fire barriers. See  
Figure 412-1.  
412.5 Aircraft paint hangars. The hazards involved with the application of flammable paint or  
other liquids cause aircraft painting operations to be highly regulated. Where the quantities of  
flammable liquids exceed the exempt quantities listed in Table 307.1\(1\), such hangars are  
classified as Group H-2 occupancies. They must be built of noncombustible construction,  
provided with fire suppression per NFPA 409, and ventilated in the manner prescribed by the  
IMC. Where the amount of flammable liquids within the hangar does not exceed the maximum  
allowable quantities set forth in Table 307.1\(1\), the classification is most appropriately a Group  
S-1 occupancy, and the provisions of this section do not apply.  
Figure 412-1 Aircraft hanger fire area.  
412.6 Aircraft manufacturing facilities. The traditional travel distance limitations have always  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbeen considered somewhat problematic for expansive aircraft manufacturing facilities without  
incorporating exit passageways or horizontal exits into the building’s means of egress system.  
Due to the compartmentalized nature of horizontal exits, they do not lend themselves to aircraft  
production processes or movement of the completely assembled aircraft. For similar reasons, exit  
passageways are generally installed below the floor of the manufacturing level. The use of  
underground passageways during a fire event or other emergency in such a large, high-volume  
space is widely viewed as generally contrary to human nature. Once aware of an event,  
employees typically evacuate the building instinctively at the level with which they are most  
familiar. It is also relatively common for occupants to want to move away from the point of  
origin of a fire due to a person’s sensory awareness within the entire open space. Given the fact  
that occupants sense safety as they move away from a fire incident, it is counterintuitive to enter  
an underground area unless as a final resort.  
In spite of these observations, it is important that it can be demonstrated that such large-  
volume spaces are able to provide a tenable environment for the evacuation or relocation of  
building occupants. The increased travel allowances established in Table 412.6 are supported by  
smoke and temperature fire modeling conducted using the National Institute of Standards and  
Technology Fire Dynamics Simulator computer program. Results of the fire modeling activity,  
based on conservative assumptions, were used to establish the maximum travel distances  
provided.  
The travel distance allowances for aircraft manufacturing facilities are therefore based on a  
combination of building features\: the minimum height from the finished floor to the bottom of  
the ceiling, roof slab, or roof deck above; and the contiguous floor area of the aircraft  
manufacturing facility having the indicated height.  
Ancillary spaces within or adjacent to the manufacturing area are permitted to egress through  
the manufacturing area having a minimum height as established by Table 412.6. The portion of  
travel within the ancillary spaces is limited to the general travel distances set forth in Table  
1017.2 based upon the occupancy classification of the ancillary space. The overall travel distance  
cannot exceed the distance indicated in Table 412.6.  
412.7 Heliports and helistops. Helistops are differentiated from heliports by the presence of  
refueling facilities, maintenance operations, and repair and storage of the helicopters; thus,  
helistops pose similar hazards to those posed by aircraft repair hangars. The minimum size of a  
helicopter landing area is addressed, as are requirements for construction features and egress.  
Where heliports and helistops are constructed in compliance with the provisions of this section,  
they may be erected on buildings regulated by this code.  
Section 413 Combustible Storage  
Any occupancy group containing high-piled stock or rack storage is subject to the provisions of  
the IFC as well as the IBC. Chapter 32 of the IFC regulates combustible storage based on a  
variety of conditions, including the type of commodities stored, as well as the height and method  
of storage and the size of the storage area.  
This section also specifically addresses any concealed spaces within buildings, including  
attics and under-floor spaces, that are used for the storage of combustible material. Where  
combustible storage occurs in areas typically considered unoccupiable, the storage areas are to be  
separated from the remainder of the building by 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction on the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstorage side. The protective membrane need only be applied on the storage side insofar as the  
location of the hazard has been identified as the storage area only. Openings are to be protected  
with self-closing door assemblies that are either of noncombustible construction or are a  
minimum 1¾-inch \(45-mm\) solid wood. This separation is not necessary in Group R-3 and U  
occupancies. In addition, those combustible storage areas protected with sprinkler systems need  
not be separated. The provisions are not intended to apply to those storage rooms that are  
constructed and regulated as usable spaces within the building, such as portions of basements  
where combustible products or materials are stored.  
Section 414 Hazardous Materials  
Figure 414-1 outlines the process for determining the code requirements that are a function of the  
quantities of hazardous materials stored or used. The outline is useful for both design and review.  
To begin, one must determine the hazardous processes and materials involved in a given  
occupancy and gain a thorough understanding of the operations taking place. Once the hazardous  
processes and materials have been identified, it is necessary to classify the materials based on the  
categories used by the code.  
Section 414.1.3 provides the means for the building official to acquire outside technical  
assistance to assist in the review of a project. Such assistance is often critical in assuring that  
appropriate decisions are made.  
Classifying materials is a subjective science, requiring judgment decisions by an expert  
familiar with the characteristics of a particular material to categorize it within the categories used  
by the IBC and IFC. Accordingly, material classifications must be determined by qualified  
individuals, such as industrial hygienists, chemists, or fire-protection engineers. Though some  
jurisdictions employ individuals qualified to make these determinations, most jurisdictions rely  
on outside experts acceptable to the jurisdiction to submit a report detailing classifications  
compatible with the system used by the code.  
Often, a permit applicant will attempt to submit a cadre of Material Safety Data Sheets  
\(MSDSs\) as a means of identifying material classifications. Though these may contain the  
information necessary to determine the proper classification, they do not normally contain a  
complete designation of classifications that is compatible with the system used by the IBC.  
Therefore, MSDSs are not normally acceptable as a sole means of providing material  
classifications to a jurisdiction. The building official should understand that it is not the  
responsibility of the jurisdiction to provide classifications for hazardous materials. Rather, it is  
the responsibility of the permit applicant to provide material classification information.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 414-1 Code approach to hazardous materials.  
In the classification system used by the International Codes®  
, hazardous materials are  
generally divided into two major categories, physical and health hazards, and 12 subcategories,  
as follows\:  
Physical Hazards  
Explosives and fireworks  
Combustible dusts and fibers  
Flammable and combustible liquids  
Flammable solids and gases  
Organic peroxides  
Oxidizers  
Pyrophoric materials  
Unstable \(reactive\) materials  
Water-reactive materials  
Cryogenic liquids  
Health Hazards  
Highly toxic and toxic materials  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationCorrosives  
414.1.3 Information required. A report is required to allow the building department to evaluate  
the presence of hazardous materials within the proposed building based on the criteria  
established by the IBC. Since Tables 307.1\(1\) and 307.1\(2\) are critical in the evaluation of  
buildings containing hazardous materials, information is needed in order to properly utilize the  
tables. Such information must include the maximum expected quantities of each material in use  
and/or storage conditions, those fire-protection features that are to be in place, and any use of  
control areas for isolation of the materials. The submission of a technical report is necessary to  
allow the jurisdiction to perform a code compliance evaluation. The requirement for a technical  
report gives jurisdictions the benefit of expert opinions provided by knowledgeable persons in  
the particular hazard field of concern. Technical reports are required to be prepared by an  
individual, firm, or corporation acceptable to the jurisdiction, and must be provided without  
charge to the jurisdiction. Where the quantities of hazardous materials are such that a Group H  
occupancy is warranted, floor plans must be submitted to the building official identifying the  
locations of hazardous contents and processes.  
414.2 Control areas. As addressed previously in the discussion of Section 307, areas in a  
building that are designated to contain the maximum allowable quantities of hazardous materials  
in use, storage, dispensing, or handling are considered control areas. At a minimum, 1-hour fire  
barriers shall be used to separate control areas from each other. Where required by Table 414.2.2  
for the fourth story above grade plane and all stories above, a minimum 2-hour fire-resistance  
rating is required for such fire barriers. Openings in fire barriers are to be protected in accordance  
with Section 716. As a general rule, all floor construction that forms the boundaries of control  
areas is to have a minimum 2-hour fire-resistance rating. Building elements structurally  
supporting the 2-hour floor construction shall have an equivalent fire-resistance rating. There is  
an allowance for those two-story and three-story sprinklered buildings that are primarily of 1-  
hour fire-resistive construction \(Types IIA, IIIA, IV, and VA\), which permits 1-hour floor  
construction of the control area and the supporting construction. It is apparent that a considerable  
level of fire separation must be achieved in order to increase the quantity of hazardous materials  
in non–Group H buildings. An example of this provision is illustrated in Figure 414-2.  
In addition to the fire-resistive separations enclosing control areas, the quantities of hazardous  
materials and the number of control areas are limited on a story-by-story basis. The number of  
control areas, per story, within a structure may be increased through the use of fire walls  
designed and constructed in accordance with Section 706. For example, in a one-story structure  
where Table 414.2.2 limits the number of control areas in the building to four, a single fire wall  
would permit a total of eight control areas \(four on each side of the fire wall\).  
The control area concept is extended to the regulation of laboratories in colleges and  
universities through the special provisions of Section 428 rather than those found in Section  
414.2\. Identified as “laboratory suites” rather than control areas, these compartments housing the  
use and/or storage of hazardous materials in a higher education setting are regulated a bit  
differently as found in the discussion of Section 428.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 414-2 Control areas.  
414.5.1 Explosion control. Table 414.5.1 indicates, based on material, the explosion control  
methods that must be provided where hazardous materials exceed the allowable quantities  
specified in Table 307.1\(1\). Explosion control is also required in any structure, room, or space  
occupied for purposes involving explosion hazards. Once some type of explosion control is  
required, Section 911 of the IFC must be referenced to identify the details for controlling  
explosion hazards.  
414.5.3 Spill control, drainage, and containment. The intent of this section is the prevention of  
the accidental spread of hazardous material releases to locations outside of containment areas.  
Applicable to rooms, buildings, or areas used for the storage of both solid and liquid hazardous  
materials, the specifics for spill control, drainage, and containment are contained in the IFC.  
414.6.1 Weather protection. In order to be considered outside storage or use in the application  
of the IFC, hazardous material storage or use areas must be primarily open to the exterior. If it is  
necessary to shelter such areas for weather protection purposes, the enclosure and its location are  
limited by the following requirements\:  
1\. No more than one side of the perimeter of the area may be obstructed by enclosing walls  
and structural supports unless the total obstructed perimeter is limited to 25 percent of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. 3. 4. structure’s total perimeter.  
The minimum clearance between the structure and neighboring buildings, lot lines, or  
public ways shall be equivalent to that required for outside storage or use areas without  
weather protection.  
Unless increased by the provisions of Section 506, the maximum area of the overhead  
structure shall be 1,500 square feet \(140 m2\).  
The structure must be constructed of approved noncombustible materials.  
Section 415 Groups H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4, and H-5  
The provisions of this section apply to those buildings and structures where hazardous materials  
are stored or used in amounts exceeding the maximum allowable quantities identified in Section  
307\. Applied in concert with the IFC, the requirements address the concerns presented by the  
high level of hazard as compared to other uses. For a further discussion, see the commentary on  
Section 414.  
415.6 Fire separation distance. This section provides regulations that limit the locations on a lot  
for Group H occupancies and establish minimum percentages of perimeter walls of Group H  
occupancies required to be located on the building exterior. Based on the specific Group H  
occupancy involved, the building must be set back a minimum distance from lot lines, as shown  
in Figure 415-1. As illustrated in Figure 415-2, the distance is measured from the walls enclosing  
the high-hazard occupancy to the lot lines, including those on a public way. An exception to this  
method of measurement occurs where multiple buildings are on the same site and an assumed  
imaginary line is placed between them under the provisions of Section 705.3. In such a situation,  
the assumed line is to be ignored in the application of this section for those buildings that  
manufacture or use explosives and the IFC is utilized to provide adequate spatial separation.  
Only in such limited cases are assumed lot lines not to be applied. The specific provisions in this  
section also require that Group H-2 and H-3 occupancies included in mixed-use buildings have  
25 percent of the perimeter wall of the Group H occupancy on the exterior of the building. The  
access capability for fire personnel is greatly enhanced where the hazardous conditions are  
located in such a manner that allows for exterior fire-fighting operations. Allowances are  
provided for smaller, liquid use, dispensing, and mixing rooms; liquid storage rooms; and spray  
booths. See Figure 415-3. It should be noted that where a detached building, required by Table  
415.6.5, is located on the lot in accordance with this section, wall construction and opening  
protection are not regulated based on the location on the lot. A minimum fire separation distance  
of 50 feet \(15,240 mm\) is required for such buildings. Therefore, the exterior wall and opening  
requirements of Table 602 have no application.  
415.7 Special provisions for Group H-1 occupancies. Because of the extreme hazard presented  
by Group H-1 occupancies, this section requires that such occupancies be used for no other  
purpose. Roofs are required to be of lightweight construction so that, in case of an explosion,  
they will rapidly vent with minimum destruction to the building. In addition, thermal insulation  
is sometimes required to prevent heat-sensitive materials from reaching decomposition  
temperatures.  
This section also requires that Group H-1 occupancies that contain materials possessing health  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationhazards in amounts exceeding the maximum allowable quantities for health-hazard materials in  
Table 307.1\(2\) also meet the requirements for Group H-4 occupancies. This provision is parallel  
to Section 307.8, which requires multiple hazards classified in more than one Group H  
occupancy to conform to the code for each of the occupancies classified.  
415.8 Special provisions for Group H-2 and H-3 occupancies. Group H-2 and H-3  
occupancies containing large quantities of the more dangerous types of physical hazard materials  
are considered to present unusual fire or explosion hazards that warrant a separate and distinct  
occupancy in a detached building used for no other purpose, similar to the requirements for a  
Group H-1 occupancy. The threshold quantities for requiring detached Group H-2 and H-3  
occupancies are set forth in Table 415.6.5.  
This section also requires water-reactive materials to be protected from water penetration or  
liquid leakage. Fire-protection piping is allowed in such areas in recognition of both the integrity  
of fire-protection system installations and the need to protect water-reactive materials from  
exposure fires.  
Figure 415-1 Location on property for detached buildings.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 415-2 Location on property for mixed occupancies that include a Group H-2  
occupancy.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 415-3 Perimeter of occupancy on exterior wall.  
415.9 Group H-2. Both this section and the IFC are to be used in the regulation of buildings  
containing the following hazardous materials operations\:  
1\. Flammable and combustible liquids  
2\. Liquefied petroleum gas distribution facilities  
3\. Dry cleaning plants  
The hazards presented in these operations, through the storage, use, handling, processing, or  
transporting of hazardous materials, are unique enough to require special provisions, both in this  
section and in the IFC. The regulations of buildings in which materials that produce combustible  
dusts are stored or handled are further established in Section 426.  
415.10 Groups H-3 and H-4. This section identifies several specific issues in Group H-3 and H-  
4 occupancies. Group H gas rooms shall be isolated from other areas of the building by  
minimum 1-hour fire barriers and/or horizontal assemblies. Highly toxic solids and liquids must  
also be separated from other hazardous material storage by fire barriers and/or horizontal  
assemblies having a minimum 1-hour fire-resistance rating, unless the highly toxic materials are  
stored in approved hazardous material storage cabinets. A related provision requires liquid-tight  
noncombustible floor construction in areas used for the storage of corrosive liquids and highly  
toxic or toxic materials.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation415.11 Group H-5. The Group H-5 occupancy category was created to standardize regulations  
for semiconductor manufacturing facilities. This section provides the specific regulations for  
these occupancies. The Group H-5 category requires engineering and fire-safety controls that  
reduce the overall hazard of the occupancy to a level thought to be equivalent to a moderate-  
hazard Group B occupancy. Accordingly, the allowable floor areas established for Group H-5  
occupancies are the same as those for Group B occupancies.  
The code requires that special ventilation systems be installed in fabrication areas that will  
prevent explosive fuel-to-air mixtures from developing. The ventilation system must be  
connected to an emergency power system. Furthermore, buildings containing Group H-5  
occupancies are required to be protected throughout by an automatic fire-sprinkler system and  
fire and emergency alarm systems. Fire and emergency alarm systems are intended to be separate  
and distinct systems, with the emergency alarm system providing a signal for emergencies other  
than fire. This section also provides requirements for piping and tubing that transport hazardous  
materials that allow piping to be located in exit corridors and above other occupancies subject to  
numerous, stringent protection criteria. The provisions for Group H-5 occupancies are correlated  
with companion provisions in Chapter 27 of the IFC.  
Table 415.6.5—Detached Building Required. This table establishes the threshold quantities of  
hazardous materials requiring detached buildings. Once the quantities listed in the table are  
exceeded, a detached building is required. The limitations placed on detached buildings required  
by Table 415.6.5 and classified as Group H-2 or H-3 are essentially the same as those applied to  
H-1 occupancies. The applicability of the table is based solely on the total quantity of material  
present. The material can be in use, in storage, or both. See Application Example 415-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 415-1  
Section 416 Spray Application of Flammable Finishes  
This section applies to those buildings used for the spraying of flammable finishes such as paints,  
varnishes, and lacquers. In addition, Chapter 24 of the IFC contains extensive requirements for  
these types of operations. The IFC addresses a variety of spraying arrangements, each of which  
is specifically defined and regulated. These include spray rooms, spray booths, spraying spaces,  
and limited spraying spaces. The IBC provides limited construction provisions only for those  
arrangements determined to be spray rooms, as well as ventilation and surfacing requirements for  
all spraying spaces. An automatic fire-extinguishing system is mandated for all areas where the  
application of flammable finishes occurs, including all spray rooms and spray booths.  
The occupancy classification of buildings, rooms, and spaces utilized for flammable finish  
application is not specifically addressed. Item 1 of Section 307.1.1 indicates that classification as  
a Group H occupancy is not applicable where such buildings or areas meet the requirements of  
Section 416 and the IFC. Therefore, the occupancy classification analysis would be no different  
from that for other types of uses. In a manufacturing building, a Group F-1 occupancy  
classification would be appropriate. Spraying operations within a vehicle repair garage would  
most likely be considered part of the Group S-1 classification. In a Group B adult vocational  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationschool, an area containing spraying activities would be considered a portion of the Group B  
occupancy.  
A spray room, designed and constructed to house the spraying of flammable finishes, must be  
adequately separated from the remainder of the building. The enclosure must consist of fire  
barriers, horizontal assemblies, or both, each having a minimum fire-resistance rating of 1 hour.  
In addition, the walls and ceilings are to be of noncombustible construction or the surfaces must  
have noncombustible coverings. Spraying rooms must be frequently cleaned; thus, all of the  
interior surfaces must be smooth and easily maintained. The smooth surfaces also allow for the  
free passage of air in order to maintain efficient ventilation. The room construction must also be  
tight in order to eliminate the passage of residues from the room, which should be easily  
accomplished because of the fire separation required. Spraying spaces not separately enclosed  
shall be provided with noncombustible spray curtains to restrict the spread of vapors.  
Section 417 Drying Rooms  
Where the manufacturing process requires the use of a drying room or dry kiln, the room or kiln  
containing the drying operations must be of noncombustible construction. It must also be  
constructed in conformance with the specific and general provisions of the code as they relate to  
the special type of operations, processes, and materials that are involved. Clearance between  
combustible contents that are placed in the dryer and any overhead heating pipes must be at least  
2 inches \(51 mm\). In addition, methods are addressed to insulate high-temperature dryers from  
adjacent combustible materials.  
Section 418 Organic Coatings  
Defined in Section 202 of the IFC, organic coatings are those compounds that are applied for the  
purpose of obtaining a finish that is protective, durable, and decorative. Used to protect  
structures, equipment, and similar items, organic coatings provide a surface finish that resists the  
effects of harsh weather. The concern for occupancies where organic coatings are manufactured  
or stored is based primarily on the presence of flammable vapors. As such, this type of use is  
highly controlled, by both the IBC and the IFC.  
The manufacturing of organic coatings creates a high probability that flammable vapors will  
be present. Therefore, buildings where such materials are manufactured shall be without  
basements or pits because of the heavier-than-air nature of the vapors. In addition, no other  
occupancies are permitted in buildings used for the manufacture of organic coatings. The  
processing of flammable or heat-sensitive material must be done in a noncombustible or  
detached structure. Tank storage of flammable and combustible liquids inside a building must  
also be located above grade. In order to isolate the various hazard areas, the storage tank area  
must be separated from the remainder of the processing areas by minimum 2-hour fire barriers  
and/or horizontal assemblies. Because of the extreme hazards involved with nitrocellulose  
storage, it must also be separated by 2-hour fire-resistance-rated fire barriers and/or horizontal  
assemblies, or preferably located on a detached pad or in a separate structure.  
Section 420 Groups I-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIn residential-type uses, it is important that any fire conditions created in one of the dwelling  
units or sleeping units do not spread quickly to any of the other units. As residential fires are the  
most common of fire incidents, it is critical that neighboring units be isolated from the unit of  
fire origin. The need for an adequate level of fire resistance is enhanced because of the lack of  
immediate awareness of fire conditions when the building’s occupants are sleeping. The  
provisions are applicable to hotels and other Group R-1 occupancies, apartment buildings,  
dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, and other types of Group R-2 occupancies, and  
between dwelling units of a Group R-3 two-family dwelling. Sleeping units and dwelling units of  
a supervised residential care facility classified as Groups R-4 and I-1 must also be provided with  
such fire-resistive separations.  
Where dwelling units or sleeping units are adjacent to each other horizontally, the minimum  
required separation is a fire partition. The wall serving as a fire partition is regulated by Section  
708 and typically must have a minimum 1-hour fire-resistance rating. A reduction to a ½-hour  
fire partition is permitted under the special conditions set forth in Exception 2 of Section 708.3.  
Where dwelling or sleeping units are located on multiple floors of a building, they must be  
separated from each other with minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated horizontal assemblies as  
described in Section 711. An allowance for a ½-hour reduction, similar to that permitted for fire  
partitions, is also available under specified conditions.  
In addition to the required separation between adjoining units, dwelling units and sleeping  
units must also be separated with complying fire partitions and/or horizontal assemblies from  
other adjacent occupancies. Applicable in multiple-use buildings, this requirement takes  
precedence over the allowances in Sections 508.2 and 508.3 for accessory occupancies and  
nonseparated occupancies, respectively. Even in those cases where the multiple-occupancy  
provisions of Section 508.2 or 508.3 are applied, the separation requirements of Section 420  
must be followed. In those cases where the separated occupancy provisions of Section 508.4 are  
utilized, the more restrictive fire-resistive rating is applied.  
It should be noted that the separation of dwelling units and sleeping units from other types of  
spaces in the building appears to only apply if those spaces are of a different occupancy from  
that of the residential units. For example, a separation is not required between a Group R-1  
sleeping unit in a hotel and the adjacent hotel lobby if the lobby is classified as a portion of the  
Group R-1 occupancy. However, it would seem that the intent of this section suggests that a  
separation be provided in order to isolate each individual dwelling unit or sleeping unit,  
regardless of the classification of the adjacent space. See Figure 420-1.  
Studies have shown that cooking appliances are the leading cause of fires in residential  
settings. Electric ranges are by far the leading cause of home cooking appliance fires. Unattended  
cooking is a factor in the majority of home electric range fires. Physical conditions such as  
falling asleep or impairment by alcohol or drugs are other contributing factors. Distractions that  
pull the cook outside of the kitchen \(doorbell, social interactions\) are another. Due to these  
concerns, the installation and use of domestic cooking appliances are regulated in both common  
areas and sleeping rooms of Group R-2 college dormitories. The scope of the provisions is  
limited to those appliances intended to be used by residents of Group R-2 college dormitories. It  
does not apply to residential dwelling units on college campuses that are not classified as  
dormitories. In addition to a limit on the types of appliances and their locations, cooktops and  
ranges are further regulated due to their increased hazard.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 420-1 Separation of dwelling units and sleeping units.  
Section 422 Ambulatory Care Facilities  
Ambulatory care facilities, often referred to as ambulatory surgery centers or day surgery  
centers, are defined in Chapter 2 as a building or portion of a building “used to provide medical,  
surgical, psychiatric, nursing or similar care on a less than 24-hour basis to individuals who are  
rendered incapable of self-preservation by the services provided or staff has accepted  
responsibility for care recipients already incapable.  
” Classified as Group B occupancies, such  
facilities are generally regarded as moderate in hazard level due to their office-like conditions.  
However, additional hazards are typically of concern due to the presence of individuals who are  
temporarily rendered incapable of self-preservation due to the application of nerve blocks,  
sedation, or anesthesia. While the occupants may walk in and walk out the same day with a quick  
recovery time after surgery, there is a period of time where a potentially sizable number of  
people could require physical assistance in case of an emergency that would require evacuation  
or relocation.  
Although classified as a Group B occupancy in the same manner as an outpatient clinic or  
other health-care office, an ambulatory care facility poses distinctly different hazards to life and  
fire safety, such as\:  
• Patients incapable of self-preservation require rescue by other occupants or emergency  
responders.  
• Medical staff must stabilize the patient prior to evacuation, possibly resulting in delayed  
staff evacuation.  
• Use of oxidizing medical gases such as oxygen and nitrous oxide.  
• Potential for surgical fires.  
As a result of the increased hazard level, additional safeguards have been put in place. Smoke  
compartments must be provided in larger facilities, and the installation of fire-protection systems  
is typically mandated. See Figure 422-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAny story containing ambulatory care facilities having more than 10,000 square feet \(929 m2\)  
of floor area must be subdivided into at least two smoke compartments by smoke barriers in  
accordance with Section 709. The limit on compartment size of 22,500 square feet \(2,092 m2\)  
may require that three or more smoke compartments be provided. Additional compartments may  
also be required due to travel distance limitations. Any point within a smoke compartment must  
be no more than 200 feet \(60,960 mm\) in travel distance from a smoke barrier door. Each smoke  
compartment must be large enough to allow for 30 square feet \(2.8 m2\) of refuge area for each  
nonambulatory patient. In addition, at least one means of egress must be available from each  
smoke compartment without the need to return back through the original compartment. Fire-  
safety evacuation plans must be provided where smoke compartments are mandated. The plans  
are intended to address the defend-in-place philosophy for emergency response as defined in  
Section 202 and regulated by Sections 404 and 406 of the IFC.  
Figure 422-1 Ambulatory care facility.  
As a general rule, Group B occupancies do not require a sprinkler system based solely on their  
occupancy classification. However, Section 903.2.2 mandates that a Group B ambulatory care  
facility be provided with an automatic sprinkler system when either of the following conditions  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationexist at any time\:  
• Four or more care recipients are incapable of self-preservation, or  
• One or more care recipients who are incapable of self-preservation are located at other  
than the level of exit discharge.  
The extent of the sprinkler protection is detailed in Section 903.2.2. In addition, the fire alarm  
requirements are more stringent than those of other Group B occupancies. Section 907.2.2.1  
requires the installation of a manual fire alarm system in all Group B fire areas containing an  
ambulatory health-care facility. The manual fire alarm boxes are not required if the building is  
fully sprinklered and the occupant notification appliances activate upon sprinkler water flow. The  
required automatic smoke detection system is also not required where the same conditions occur.  
Although not very common, there are times where physical therapy areas of ambulatory care  
facilities contain kitchens to educate patients in the safe operation of cooking equipment. Such  
training may be helpful to the patients for when they are cooking at home, or it may be a portion  
of nutrition counseling. In addition, domestic cooking facilities are often used for other purposes,  
such as where the cooking appliances are installed in an employee break room. Due to the  
potential hazards involved, five fundamental conditions of compliance must be met to allow the  
installation of domestic cooking appliances in ambulatory care facilities.  
Section 423 Storm Shelters  
ICC-500, ICC/NSSA Standard on the Design and Construction of Storm Shelters, establishes  
minimum requirements for structures and spaces designated as hurricane, tornado, or  
combination shelters. The standard addresses the design of such shelters from the perspective of  
the structural requirements for high wind conditions, and addresses minimum requirements for  
the interior environment during a storm event.  
Scoping provisions mandate the construction of complying storm shelters in critical  
emergency operations facilities where such facilities are located in geographical areas where the  
shelter design wind speed is at its highest\: 250 miles per hour. This geographical area, which  
includes most of the Interior Plains region of the United States, is identified in detail in ICC 500.  
Critical facilities, such as emergency operations centers, fire and police stations, and buildings  
with similar functions, are essential for the delivery of vital services or the protection of a  
community. It is important to protect the occupants of such critical facilities struck by tornadoes,  
as well as to maintain continuity of operations for those facilities. Emergency operations  
facilities, as well as police and fire rescue facilities, are crucial to disaster response because an  
interruption in their operation as a result of building equipment failure may prevent rescue  
operations, evacuation, assistance delivery, or general maintenance of law and order, which can  
have serious consequences for the community after a storm event.  
Most Group E educational occupancies must also be provided with complying storm shelters  
under the same criteria. Due to unpredictable and often very short tornado warning time, there  
are many high-wind events where it is unfeasible to evacuate school buildings. Therefore, it is  
very important that refuge areas be provided that are capable of providing a near-absolute level  
of protection for the vulnerable individuals. The minimum required shelter capacity can be  
provided in the educational building served, in an adjacent building or buildings, or in a  
combination of buildings. Where a remote storm shelter is required to provide the required  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcapacity, the entry door of the shelter must be no more than 1,000 feet \(305 m\) of travel distance  
from an exterior door of the building served. Where the building served is a Group E occupancy,  
additional criteria addressing the determination of the minimum required capacity of the storm  
shelter\(s\) is provided.  
Section 424 Play Structures  
Play structures for various recreational activities were regulated for some time by the IBC only  
where such structures were located within covered mall buildings and intended for use by  
children. The primary concern, consistent with that of other structures located within a covered  
mall building, was the combustibility of such play structures. Due to the potential fire hazards  
associated with play structures, the regulations are now applicable where such structures are  
located within any building regulated by the IBC, regardless of occupancy classification.  
Because concerns relating to potential fire hazards due to the combustibility and flammability of  
the structure and its content are present regardless of the ages of the participants, the provisions  
are also now applicable to all such structures. Only those play structures that exceed 10 feet  
\(3,048 mm\) in height or 150 square feet \(14 m2\) in area are to be regulated by the IBC.  
Play structures must be constructed of noncombustible materials or, as an option if  
combustible, must comply with the appropriate criteria established in Section 424. Such  
alternative methods include the use of fire-retardant-treated wood, textiles complying with the  
designated flame propagation performance criteria, and plastics exhibiting an established  
maximum peak rate of heat release.  
Where the play structure exceeds 600 square feet \(56 m2\) in area, the interior finishes are to be  
regulated for flame spread index. In addition, the play structure require a special investigation  
acceptable to the building official to demonstrate adequate fire safety, and it must be designed in  
accordance with Chapter 16. Conformance with Chapter 16 is also required where the play  
structure exceeds 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) in height, regardless of area.  
Section 427 Medical Gas Systems  
Hospitals and most other health-care facilities typically require the use of medical gases as a  
critical component of their functions. Oxygen, nitrous oxide, and a variety of other compressed  
gases are piped into treatment rooms from medical gas storage rooms. These rooms are regulated  
for fire-resistive separation and ventilation purposes. Provisions address both exterior rooms,  
which must be located on an exterior wall, and interior rooms, where an exterior wall location  
cannot be provided. In addition, gas cabinet construction criteria are set forth. These  
requirements, historically set forth in the IFC, are also located in this chapter of the IBC in a  
manner consistent with other IFC provisions that have been replicated in the IBC in order to  
provide a more comprehensive and efficient set of construction regulations.  
Section 428 Higher Education Laboratories  
Colleges and universities often have chemistry, biology, medical, engineering, and other types of  
laboratories where significant amounts of hazardous materials are stored and used. These  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationteaching and research laboratories are regulated in a specific manner, rather than under the  
general hazardous materials provisions which often are not appropriate for specialized academic  
laboratory settings.  
There are a number of conditions typically present in higher education laboratories that make  
them unique, thus requiring unique solutions.  
• Lower hazardous materials density in individual laboratory spaces. In academic  
environments, there are typically a large number of laboratories, but each laboratory only  
contains a small amount of hazardous material. Individually the quantities in use and  
storage are relatively low; however, the total quantity of hazardous materials on the story  
can be significant, even to the point of exceeding the maximum allowable quantities per  
control area. The lower density condition is considered as a means of mitigating the  
overall risk.  
• Considerable staff oversight of activities utilizing hazardous materials. Most academic  
laboratories are well staffed with faculty members and support personnel who are well  
acquainted with hazardous material safety. They are an integral part of the preparation and  
review of laboratory safety documentations and safety audits.  
• Mixed-occupancy buildings. Higher education laboratories are often found in campus  
buildings that also contain storage, business, and assembly uses. The traditional limits on  
the permissible amount of hazardous materials on upper floor levels are extremely  
restrictive, often requiring that lecture halls and classrooms be placed on upper floors so  
that the lower stories can be utilized for laboratories. This scenario places significant  
occupant loads on upper floors above those areas devoted to the use and storage of  
hazardous materials.  
There are three primary considerations in regard to the special provisions for higher education  
laboratories. Specifically, Section 428 addresses the following primary needs\:  
• Increased general laboratory safety. Requirements and allowances specific to higher  
education laboratory uses are established in the IBC, along with a reference to NFPA 45,  
Standard on Fire Protection for Laboratories Using Chemicals. In addition, the IFC  
contains provisions addressing the unique issues of these types of laboratories in a manner  
even more comprehensive that the IBC.  
• Control area limitations. In an increasingly number of cases, the buildings housing higher  
education laboratories are built taller and/or larger than in the past. In response to this  
reality, greater numbers of control areas and larger percentages of maximum allowable  
quantities are necessary. An alternate design approach is provided for such scenarios  
where traditional control area limitations or construction as a Group H occupancy are not  
feasible. The “laboratory suite” concept provides an option to allow increased flexibility  
in the storage and use of hazardous materials while continuing to maintain a Group B  
occupancy classification.  
• Allowances for existing nonsprinklered buildings. Although not regulated due to the scope  
of the IBC, an approach to regulating existing academic laboratory buildings without fire  
sprinkler protection is established in the IFC. Limited to very small quantities of  
hazardous materials, the allowance recognizes the thousands of buildings built decades  
ago where retrofitting with sprinklers is not practical.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe IBC recognizes that these higher education laboratories can be considered as a part of the  
Group B occupancy classification afforded to other portions of college and university buildings  
provided such laboratories comply with Section 428. It is important that the IFC be consulted for  
any additional requirements related to the storage and use of hazardous materials. In addition, the  
activities are limited to the testing, analysis, teaching, research, and development on a  
nonproduction basis.  
A key aspect of the academic laboratory provisions is the creation of laboratory suites. Similar  
in concept to control areas, such suites are fully enclosed by fire-resistance-rated construction in  
order to provide containment areas. The number of laboratory suites permitted on a story, as well  
as the amount of hazardous materials that can be used and/or stored within a laboratory suite, is  
significantly greater than that allowed in control areas.  
KEY POINTS  
• Special buildings, features, and uses such as covered and open mall buildings, atriums,  
high-rise buildings, underground buildings, and parking garages are so unique in the  
type of hazards presented that specialized regulations are provided in the IBC.  
• A covered mall building or open mall building consists of various tenants and  
occupants, as well as the common pedestrian area that provides access to the tenant  
spaces.  
• For those features that are not unique to a covered or open mall building, the general  
provisions of the code apply.  
• The means of egress provisions for a covered or open mall building are typically more  
liberal than those for other buildings.  
• High-rise buildings are characterized by the difficulty of evacuation or rescue of the  
building occupants, the difficulty of fire-fighting operations from the exterior, high  
occupant loads, and potential for stack effect.  
• There are a number of provisions for high-rise buildings that are less restrictive than the  
general requirements, including the reduction in fire resistance for certain building  
elements.  
• The special allowance for a reduction in construction type is not applicable to any high-  
rise building exceeding 420 feet \(128 m\) in height.  
• Smoke detection, alarm systems, and communications systems are important  
characteristics of a high-rise building.  
• Occupant egress and evacuation, as well as fire department access, are addressed in  
high-rise buildings through provisions for stairway enclosure remoteness, an additional  
stairway, luminous egress path markings, fire service access elevators, and occupant  
evacuation elevators.  
• The use of the atrium provisions is typically limited to those multistory applications  
where compliance with the other vertical opening applications established in Section  
712.1 is not possible.  
• Buildings containing atriums, high-rise buildings, covered mall buildings, and open  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmall buildings must be provided with automatic sprinkler systems throughout.  
• Another component of the life-safety system for a building containing an atrium is a  
required smoke-control system.  
• An underground building is regulated in a manner similar to that for a high-rise  
building, as the means of egress and fire department access concerns are similarly  
extensive.  
• Fundamental to the protection features for an underground building are the  
requirements for Type I construction for the underground portion and the installation of  
an automatic sprinkler system.  
• Private garages and carports are regulated to a limited degree based on the hazards  
associated with the parking of motor vehicles.  
• Special provisions for open parking garages are typically less restrictive than those for  
enclosed parking structures because of the natural ventilation that is available.  
• In Group I-2 and I-3 occupancies, the functional concerns of the health-care operations  
must be balanced with the fire-safety concerns.  
• Stages exceeding 50 feet \(15,240 mm\) in height present additional risks that are due to  
the expected presence of high combustible loading such as curtains, scenery, and other  
stage effects.  
• Under-floor areas and attic spaces used for the storage of combustible materials must be  
isolated from other portions of the building with fire-resistance-rated construction.  
• Hazardous materials that are used or stored in any quantity are subject to regulation by  
Sections 307 and 414, and the IFC.  
• An increase in the maximum allowable quantities of hazardous materials in a building  
not classified as Group H is permitted through the proper use of control areas.  
• Group H occupancies are highly regulated because of the hazardous processes and  
materials involved in such occupancies.  
• Special provisions are applicable to the construction, installation, and use of buildings  
for the spraying of flammable finishes in painting, varnishing, and staining operations.  
• Dwelling units and sleeping units must be separated from each other and from other  
portions of the building through the use of fire partitions and/or horizontal assemblies.  
• Health-care offices where care is provided to individuals who are rendered incapable of  
self-preservation are considered to be ambulatory care facilities.  
• Storm shelters, constructed in accordance with ICC-500, are required in critical  
emergency operations facilities and most Group E occupancies.  
• Where combustible dust hazards are present in grain elevators, grinding rooms, and tire  
rebuilding facilities, special safeguards are established.  
• Medical gas systems used in health care-related facilities are regulated as to their fire-  
resistive separation from the remainder of the building.  
• Laboratories in a university or college building can be constructed as suites which  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprovide for expanded use of the control area concept in addressing the use and storage  
of hazardous materials without creating a Group H classification.

Key Points  
Chapter 5 provides general provisions that are applicable to all buildings. These include  
requirements for allowable floor area, including permitted increases for open spaces and for  
the use of automatic sprinkler systems; unlimited-area buildings; and allowable height of  
buildings. Buildings containing multiple uses and occupancies are regulated through the  
provisions for incidental uses, accessory occupancies, nonseparated occupancies, and  
separated occupancies. Miscellaneous topics addressed in Chapter 5 include premises  
identification and mezzanines.  
In addition to the general provisions set forth in Chapter 5, there are several special  
conditions under which the specific requirements of Chapter 5 can be modified or exempted,  
including the horizontal building separation allowance and unique provisions for buildings  
containing a parking garage  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 502 Building Address  
502.1 Address identification. In this section, the International Building Code® \(IBC®\) intends  
that buildings be provided with plainly visible and legible address numbers posted on the  
building or in such a place on the property that the building may be identified by emergency  
services such as fire, medical, and police. The primary concern is that responding emergency  
forces may locate the building without going through a lengthy search procedure. In furthering  
the concept, the code intends that the approved street numbers be placed in a location readily  
visible from the street or roadway fronting the property if a sign on the building would not be  
visible from the street. Address numbers may be required in multiple locations to help eliminate  
any confusion or delay in identifying the location of the emergency. The fire code official can  
require, and must approve, additional address identification locations. Regardless of the sign’s  
location, the minimum height of letters or numbers used in the address is to be at least 4 inches  
\(102 mm\) and contrast to background itself. Additional criteria are provided to provide  
consistency and clarity of the identifying numbers.  
Section 503 General Building Height and Area Limitations  
The IBC regulates the size of buildings in order to limit to a reasonable level the magnitude of a  
fire that potentially may develop. The size of a building is controlled by its floor area and height,  
and both are typically limited by the IBC. Whereas floor-area limitations are concerned primarily  
with property damage, life safety is enhanced as well by the fact that in the larger building there  
are typically more people at risk during a fire. Height restrictions are imposed to also address  
egress concerns and fire department access limitations.  
The essential ingredients in the determination of allowable areas are\:  
1\. The amount of combustibles attributable to the use that determines the potential fire  
severity.  
2\. The amount of combustibles in the construction of the building, which contributes to the  
potential fire severity.  
In addition to the two factors just itemized, there may be other features of the building that  
have an effect on area limitations. These include the presence of built-in fire protection \(an  
automatic fire-sprinkler system\), which tends to prevent the spread of fire, and open space  
\(frontage\) adjoining a sizable portion of the building’s perimeter, which decreases exposure from  
adjoining properties and provides better fire department access.  
A desirable goal of floor-area limitations in a building code is to provide a relatively uniform  
level of hazard for all occupancies and types of construction. A glance through Table 506.2 of  
the IBC will reveal that, in general, the higher hazard occupancies have lower permissible areas  
for equivalent types of construction and, in addition, the less fire-resistant and more combustible  
types of construction have more restrictive area limitations.  
The IBC also limits the maximum building height and number of stories above grade plane  
based on similar reasons discussed for area limitations. In addition, the higher the building  
becomes, the more difficult access for firefighting becomes. Furthermore, the time required for  
the evacuation of the occupants increases; therefore, the fire resistance of the building should  
also be increased.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe code presumes that when the height of the highest floor used for human occupancy  
exceeds 75 feet \(22,860 mm\), the life-safety hazard becomes even greater because most fire  
departments are unable to adequately fight a fire above this elevation from the exterior.  
Furthermore, the evacuation of occupants from the building is often not feasible. Thus, Section  
403 prescribes special provisions for these high-rise buildings. Similar concerns for buildings  
with occupied floors well below the level of exit discharge are addressed in Section 405 for  
underground buildings.  
Coming back to this section, the code specifies in Section 504 both the maximum allowable  
height in feet \(mm\) and the maximum number of stories above grade plane. The maximum  
allowable height in feet is regulated by Table 504.3 primarily by the building’s construction type,  
with limited regard for the occupancy or multiple occupancies located in the building. However,  
the maximum allowable height in stories above grade plane can vary significantly based on the  
occupancy group involved as set forth in Table 504.4. Where multiple occupancies are located in  
the same building, and the provisions of Section 508.4 for separated occupancies are utilized,  
each individual occupancy can be located no higher than set forth in the table. See Figure 503-1.  
Where the nonseparated-occupancies provisions of Section 508.3 are applied, the most restrictive  
height limitations of the nonseparated occupancies involved will limit the number of stories  
above grade plane in the entire building. See Figure 503-2. In general, the greater the potential  
fire- and life-safety hazard, the lower the permitted overall height in feet \(mm\), as well as the  
fewer the number of permitted stories above grade plane.  
Figure 503-1 Height limitations—separated occupancies example.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 503-2 Height limitations—nonseparated occupancies example.  
503.1 General. Once the occupancy group\(s\) and type of construction have been determined, the  
limitations in Tables 504.3, 504.4, and 506.2 must be consulted individually. Allowable building  
height, as set forth in Table 504.3, is based on height in feet above grade plane. Both “building  
height” and “grade plane” are defined in Chapter 2 to ensure consistent application of the  
provisions. The table includes the increased height allowances that are available for various types  
of sprinklered buildings. The allowable number of stories above grade plane is addressed in  
Table 504.4, presented in a format generally consistent with that used for Tables 504.3 and  
506.2\. Again, definitions are very important, and in this case the term “story above grade plane”  
must be fully understood to apply the provisions appropriately. An increase in allowable stories  
for most types of sprinklered buildings is also applied within Table 504.4.  
The determination of maximum allowable building area is initiated in Table 506.2 through the  
identification of the appropriate allowable area factor. This factor, utilized in the calculation of a  
building’s maximum allowable area, varies based upon occupancy classification, construction  
type, installation of an automatic sprinkler system, and number of stories above grade plane in  
the building, and is applied on a per story basis. Unlike the determination of building height and  
number of stories above grade plane, the area limitation in the table can be further increased due  
to the presence of adequate frontage at the building’s perimeter. A more detailed analysis can be  
found in the discussion of Section 506.  
In this section, the IBC also indicates that fire walls create separate buildings when evaluating  
for allowable height and area. Defined and regulated under the provisions of Section 706, the  
function of a fire wall is to separate one portion of a building from another with a fire-resistance-  
rated vertical separation element. Where a fully complying fire wall is provided, it provides two  
compartments, one on each side of the wall, which may each be considered under the IBC to be  
separate buildings for specific purposes. Multiple fire walls may be utilized to create a number of  
separate buildings within a single structure. The resulting benefit of the use of a fire wall is that  
the limitations on height, number of stories, and floor area are then addressed individually for  
each separate building created by fire walls within the structure, rather than for the structure as a  
whole.  
503.1.1 Special industrial occupancies. This special provision exempts certain types of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbuildings from both the height limitations and the area limitations found in Sections 504 and 506.  
Thus, the type of construction is not limited, regardless of building height or area. It is also not  
necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 507 for unlimited-area buildings to utilize  
this provision. Applicable to structures housing low-hazard and moderate-hazard industrial  
processes that often require quite large areas and heights, the relaxation of the general provisions  
recognizes the limited fire severity, as well as the need for expansive buildings to house  
operations such as rolling mills, structural metal-fabrication shops, foundries, and power  
distribution. It is not the intent that buildings classified as Group H occupancies be addressed  
under the allowances of Section 503.1.1. as evidenced by the specific types of uses listed in the  
provisions.  
503.1.2 Buildings on the same lot. Where two or more buildings are located on the same lot,  
they may be regulated as separate buildings in a manner generally consistent with buildings  
situated on separate parcels of land.  
As an option, multiple buildings on a single site may be considered one building, provided the  
limitations of height, number of stories, and floor area based on Sections 504 and 506 are met.  
The height and number of stories above grade plane of each building and the aggregate area of  
all buildings are to be considered in the determination. Under this method, the provisions of the  
code applicable to the aggregate building shall also apply to each building individually. Further  
regulations for buildings on the same lot are discussed in the commentary for Section 705.3.  
503.1.4 Occupied roofs. A building’s maximum allowable height in regard to number of stories  
above grade plane is determined based upon the building’s type of construction and the  
occupancy classification of the occupancies involved. A story, by definition, is considered as that  
portion of a building between the upper surface of a floor and the upper surface of the floor or  
roof next above. Because a roof deck has no floor or roof above it, an occupied roof does not  
qualify as a story. However, the presence of occupants and fire loading on an occupied roof  
requires such a condition to be specifically addressed.  
As a general rule, an occupancy is permitted to be located on the roof only if the occupancy is  
permitted by Table 504.4 to be located on the story directly below the roof. However, such a  
limitation does not apply where two conditions exist\: \(1\) the building is fully sprinklered, and \(2\)  
occupant notification per Section 907 is provided for the occupied portion\(s\) of the roof. Where  
both conditions exist, the rooftop occupancies have no effect on the building’s allowable height  
in stories above grade plane.  
In addition to the allowance that an occupied roof is not considered as a story for purposes of  
applying the IBC, it is also not considered as building area in the regulation of allowable floor  
area. Addressed in much the same manner as penthouses and other roof structures, the roof area  
is not a factor in determining the permissible building area. Where penthouses and other  
enclosed rooftop structures are in compliance with Section 1511, such structures also do not  
contribute to the building’s floor area, height, and number of stories above grade plane.  
Section 504 Building Height and Number of Stories  
As previously addressed, a building’s limiting height in feet and number of stories above grade  
plane is based upon the type of construction, occupancy classification\(s\), and presence of an  
automatic sprinkler system. Because automatic fire-sprinkler systems have exhibited an excellent  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrecord of in-place fire suppression over the years, Tables 504.3 and 504.4 generally allow greater  
heights where an automatic fire-sprinkler system is installed throughout the building. The tables  
typically reflect an increase of one story in the number of stories above grade plane, and 20 feet  
\(6,096 mm\) in building height, where the building is provided with an automatic fire-sprinkler  
system throughout.  
There are basically five variations to the general requirements for height and story increases\:  
1\. Extended height and number of stories sprinkler allowances are not permitted for Group I-  
2 occupancies of Type IIB, III, IV, or V construction, or for Groups H-1, H-2, H-3, and  
H-5 occupancies of any construction type. These occupancies present unusual hazards that  
limit their heights even where a sprinkler system is present.  
2\. One-story aircraft manufacturing buildings and hangars may be of unlimited height when  
sprinklered and surrounded by adequate open space. Such uses require very large  
structures and through the safeguards provided, should be adequately protected.  
3\. For Group R buildings provided with an NFPA 13R sprinkler system, the tables reflect  
that the increases in height and number of stories above grade plane apply only up to a  
maximum of 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) and four stories, respectively. The limitation of four  
stories above grade plane and 60 feet for buildings sprinklered with a 13R system cannot  
be exceeded under any circumstances. In those residential buildings where an NFPA 13,  
rather than an NFPA 13R system, is installed, the limitations of 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) and  
four stories above grade plane are not applicable.  
4\. Roof structures such as towers and steeples may be of unlimited height when constructed  
of noncombustible materials, whereas combustible roof structures are limited in height to  
20 feet \(6,096 mm\) above that permitted by Table 504.3. In all cases, such roof structures  
are to be constructed of materials based on the building’s type of construction. These  
requirements are not based on the presence of the sprinkler system. Additional  
requirements for roof structures can be found in Section 1511.  
5\. The allowable height in feet and number of stories above grade plane for Type IV-A, IV-  
B, and IV-C mass timber buildings are based upon a variety of factors due to the unique  
features of these three construction types. In addition, the expectation is that such mass  
timber buildings be fully sprinklered. As a result, the typical allowances that the  
maximum permissible height and number of stories above grade plane for nonsprinklered  
\(NS\) buildings be established at 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) and one story, respectively, below  
that permitted for sprinklered buildings are not recognized. Nonsprinklered values are  
nevertheless provided in the table to allow for the calculation of area increases for open  
perimeter conditions, which are based on NS building areas.  
Section 505 Mezzanines and Equipment Platforms  
A mezzanine is defined in Chapter 2 as an intermediate level or levels between the floor and  
ceiling of any story. As such, a mezzanine is not considered as a story but is rather deemed to be  
located “within” a story. An intermediate floor level of limited size and without enclosure has  
historically been deemed to cause no significant safety hazard. The occupants of the mezzanine  
by means of sight, smell, or hearing will be able to determine if there is some emergency or fire  
that takes place either on the mezzanine or in the room in which the mezzanine is located.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationHowever, once portions of or all of the mezzanine is enclosed, or the mezzanine exceeds one-  
third the area of the room in which it is located, life-safety problems such as occupants not being  
aware of an emergency or finding a safe exit route from the mezzanine become important.  
Therefore, the code places the restrictions encompassed in this section on mezzanines to  
ameliorate the life safety that can be created.  
505.2 Mezzanines. By virtue of the conditions placed on mezzanines in Section 505, a  
complying mezzanine is not considered to create additional building area or an additional story  
for the purpose of limiting building size. In the determination of a building story’s floor area for  
allowable area purposes, the floor area of a complying mezzanine need not be added to the area  
of the floor below. As previously mentioned, complying mezzanines also do not contribute to the  
actual number of stories in relationship to the allowable number of stories above grade plane  
permitted by Table 504.4. The limitations imposed on mezzanines are deemed sufficient to  
permit such benefits.  
In contrast to the above allowances, the floor area of mezzanines must be included as a part of  
the aggregate floor area in determining the fire area. Because the size of a fire area is based on a  
perceived level of fire loading present within the building, the contribution of a mezzanine’s fire  
load to the fire loading in the room in which the mezzanine is located cannot be overlooked.  
Figure 505-1 depicts the proper use of these provisions. The clear height above and below the  
floor of the mezzanine is also regulated at a minimum height of 7 feet \(2,134 mm\).  
505.2.1 Area limitation. There is no limit on the number of mezzanines that may be placed  
within a room; however, the total floor area of all mezzanines must typically not exceed one-  
third the floor area of the room in which they are located. See Figure 505-2. As illustrated in  
Figure 505-3, any enclosed areas of the room in which the mezzanine is located are not to be  
utilized in the calculations for determining compliance with the one-third rule.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 505-1 Mezzanine height and area.  
Figure 505-2 Mezzanine area.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 505-3 Mezzanine area.  
Where two specific conditions exist, the aggregate floor area of mezzanines may be increased  
up to two-thirds of the floor area of the room below. First, the building must contain special  
industrial processes as identified in Section 503.1.1, and second, the building shall be of Type I  
or Type II construction. Intermediate floor levels are very common in buildings of this kind  
because of the nature of their operations. By limiting the increased mezzanine size to  
noncombustible buildings housing primarily noncombustible processes, fire safety is not  
compromised.Because Section 503.1.1 exempts buildings addressed in this exception from  
number of story and floor area limits, there is seldom, if ever, any need to apply Exception 1.  
Exception 2 also permits an increase in allowable mezzanine size, in this case up to a  
maximum of one-half of the area or room in which the mezzanine is located. See Figure 505-4.  
The increased size takes into consideration the enhancements of noncombustible construction,  
automatic sprinkler system protection, and occupant notification by means of an emergency  
voice/alarm communication system. By limiting construction to Type I or II, there is no  
contribution to the fire hazard that is due to the materials of construction. The automatic  
sprinkler protection will increase the potential for limiting fire spread. In addition, the occupant  
notification system increases occupant awareness of a fire condition and allows for evacuation  
during the early fire stages.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 505-4 Maximum floor area of mezzanine.  
505.2.3 Openness. As a general rule, a mezzanine must be open to the room in which it is  
located. Any side that adjoins the room will be considered open if it is unobstructed, other than  
by walls or railings not more than 42 inches \(1,067 mm\) in height, or columns and posts. There  
are, however, five exceptions to the requirement for openness that result in most mezzanines  
being permitted to be partially or completely enclosed. If in compliance with any one of the five  
exceptions, the mezzanine need not be enclosed.  
1\. The sole, criterion is that the enclosed area contains a maximum occupant load of 10  
persons. The limitation on occupant load is based on the aggregate area of the enclosed  
space. This exception is consistent with other provisions of the code that relax the  
requirements where the occupant load is expected to be relatively small. This exception  
may result in the enclosure of an entire mezzanine or just a portion of it.  
2\. A mezzanine may also be fully or partially enclosed if it is provided with two means of  
egress. No further conditions are established under this option.  
3\. Up to 10 percent of the mezzanine area may be enclosed, typically applicable to toilet  
rooms, closets, utility rooms, and other similar uses that must, of necessity, be within an  
enclosure. As long as the aggregate area does not exceed 10 percent of the area of the  
mezzanine, the enclosure is permitted by the code.  
4\. Those mezzanines used for control equipment in industrial buildings may be glazed on all  
sides. This exception is necessary because of the delicate nature of much of today’s  
control equipment and the fact that it may require a dust-free environment.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation5\. This exception allows enclosure of the entire mezzanine, provided specified egress and  
sprinkler provisions are met. Similar to the conditions of Exception 2, this exception  
requires a minimum of two means of egress from the mezzanine. However, it differs in  
that a number of additional conditions are required. Therefore, there is no application of  
this exception as Exception 2 satisfies the condition for the enclosure of mezzanines  
without any other conditions of compliance.  
505.3 Equipment platforms. In buildings containing platforms that house equipment, such  
platforms need not be considered stories or mezzanines, provided they conform to the provisions  
of this section regulating platform size, extent of automatic sprinkler protection, and guards. In  
addition, the equipment platforms cannot serve as any portion of the exiting system from the  
building. Complying platforms are not deemed to be additional stories, do not contribute to the  
building floor area, and furthermore, need not be included in determining the size of the fire area.  
Section 506 Building Area  
506.1 General. Building area is one of the three limiting factors in the IBC when it comes to  
determining maximum allowable building size based on occupancy and type of construction  
classifications. The presence of automatic sprinkler protection and/or the amount of building  
frontage also contribute to this determination. The process is initiated in Table 506.2 where the  
allowable area factor is identified, and continued through the application of the frontage  
modifier. A general overview of the concept regarding allowable building area can be found in  
the discussion of Section 503.  
There are two additional approaches to allowable area compliance that modify or exempt  
compliance with Section 506. For those buildings constructed under the provisions of Section  
507, there is no limit on floor area, provided specified conditions are met. In addition,  
modifications and exemptions to height and area limitations of Chapter 5 are set forth in Section  
510\. Although there is no requirement to apply Section 507 or 510 for allowable area  
determination, the allowances provided in these sections provide alternative methods for  
compliance.  
The code intends that a basement that does not exceed the allowable floor area permitted for a  
one-story building need not be included in determining the total allowable area of the building.  
This provision is a holdover from many years back when basements were most commonly used  
for service of the building. Today, it is not uncommon to find basements occupied for the same  
uses as the upper floors. There apparently has been no adverse experience for cases of this type  
\(most likely because of the fire-sprinkler protection required in most basements\), and therefore  
the code provision appears to be satisfactory. The code does not address how to handle a  
basement that exceeds the area permitted for a one-story building. However, as the code does not  
permit any story to exceed that permitted for a one-story building, it would seem logical that a  
basement should also be limited to the same area. If anything, a fire in a basement is more  
difficult to fight than one in an above-ground story. Thus, it does not seem reasonable or  
appropriate to permit a single basement with an area exceeding that allowed for a one-story  
building. Multiple basements are also exempt from inclusion in the building area calculations,  
but only where the aggregate area of such basements does not exceed the area permitted for a  
single-story building. Additional requirements for basements extending well below grade level  
may be found in Section 405 for underground buildings.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation506.2.1 Single-occupancy, buildings. The most straightforward determination of allowable area  
is applied to those buildings no more than three stories above grade plane that contain only one  
occupancy classification. The formula for the calculation of the maximum allowable area for  
these types of buildings \(in square feet\), Equation 5-1, is additive. It is based on the sum of the  
tabular allowable area factor shown in Table 506.2 plus any increase that is due to building  
frontage per Section 506.3. Equation 5-1 provides for the maximum allowable floor area for each  
story of a building having one, two, or three stories above grade plane. An example is shown in  
Application Example 506-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 506-1  
Where the building has four or more stories above grade plane, the total building area based  
on the sum of the floor areas of all stories above grade plane is further limited. The calculation of  
the allowable building area is based on Equation 5-2 limiting the total building area to three  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationtimes the allowable area as calculated in Equation 5-1. It is important to note that any individual  
story cannot exceed the allowable area as determined by Equation 5-1. See Application Example  
506-2\. The exception to this methodology is applicable to only those four-story above grade  
plane buildings equipped with an NFPA 13R sprinkler system. Four-story residential  
occupancies provided with an NFPA 13R automatic sprinkler system are permitted additional  
allowable area beyond that permitted under the general provisions. As the installation of a 13R  
sprinkler system in a residential occupancy does not provide for an increase in allowable area for  
sprinklered buildings, and the use of an NFPA 13R system is limited to buildings no more than  
four stories in height, it is considered appropriate to permit the maximum allowable area per  
story for each of the stories in the residential building. This would include the four-story  
structure as depicted in Figure 506-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 506-2  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 506-1 Group R area determination example.  
How does the installation of an automatic sprinkler system relate to a building’s allowable  
floor area? The tabular allowable area factors established in Table 506.2 include any increases  
that may be appropriate due to the installation of an automatic sprinkler system. Because of the  
excellent record of automatic sprinkler systems for the early detection and suppression of fires,  
the IBC allows quite large floor-area increases where an automatic fire sprinkler system is  
installed throughout the building. As evidenced in Table 506.2, the maximum allowable area of a  
fully sprinklered one-story building is typically four times the amount for a NS building; and for  
a building of two or more stories in height, the tabular allowable area is typically three times the  
floor area permitted for a NS condition. The lesser sprinkler benefit for multistory buildings is  
based on the assumption by the code that fire department suppression activities are still going to  
be required even where an automatic fire-sprinkler system is installed. Therefore, a multistory  
building presents more problems to the fire department than a one-story building, and a smaller  
floor area allowance is permitted.  
Table 506.2 reflects increased floor area allowances for buildings protected throughout with  
an NFPA 13 sprinkler system, but not those buildings protected with an NFPA 13R system. In  
addition, the increased floor areas are not applicable to Group H-1, H-2, or H-3 occupancies. The  
code considers that the conditions requiring the installation of sprinkler systems in these three  
high-hazard occupancies are such that the sprinkler system should not also be used to provide  
additional allowable area. In a mixed-occupancy building, this restriction is only applicable to  
the Group H-2 and H-3 portions. Other occupancies within the building are permitted to utilize  
the allowable areas established for building protected by an automatic sprinkler system as  
indicated in Section 506.2.2.1.  
What other conditions affect the determination of allowable floor areas? As expected, there  
are other situations that can arise involving the determination of the allowable area for a  
building. It should be noted that, as illustrated in Figure 506-2, the introduction of a fire wall in a  
large-area building will result in the loss of a portion of the open space at the building perimeter.  
Figure 506-3 illustrates the permitted frontage increase for an open space shared by two  
buildings on the same lot.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 506-2 Area increases with fire wall.  
Figure 506-3 Area increases for open spaces.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation506.2.2 Mixed-occupancy, buildings. For allowable area purposes, the introduction of multiple  
occupancies into the building requires an additional level of scrutiny. The methods for  
determining allowable area compliance in mixed-occupancy buildings differ based on the  
manner in which the various occupancies are addressed. Where the accessory occupancy method  
is utilized, the allowable area of the main occupancy will govern. Where occupancies are  
regulated under the nonseparated occupancy method, the allowable area is limited to that of the  
most restrictive occupancy involved. In the case of separated occupancies, the unity formula  
must be used to determine if the allowable area is exceeded. Each individual story of a mixed-  
occupancy building must be evaluated for allowable area compliance, based on the process as  
addressed in Section 508.1. Further discussion can be found in the narratives of Section 508 for  
each of the three mixed-occupancy methodologies.  
Similar to the approach described in Section 506.2.1 for buildings, of three stories or less  
above grade plane a mixed-occupancy building must be analyzed on a story-by-story basis and  
each individual story must be shown to be in compliance with the applicable provisions of  
Section 508.1. In all cases, regardless of the building’s number of stories, each individual story  
must comply for allowable area purposes. For those buildings exceeding three stories above  
grade plane the approach differs. Again, each story in the building must comply individually. In  
addition, the aggregate sum of the ratios of the actual areas of each story divided by the  
allowable areas of such stories cannot exceed three. The procedure is illustrated in Application  
Example 506-3. In buildings designed as separated occupancies and equipped with an NFPA  
13R sprinkler, the sum of the ratios of actual area divided by the allowable areas shall not exceed  
four.  
In all cases for mixed-occupancy conditions, reference is made to the provisions of Section  
508.1, which identify the three options for mixed-occupancy determination \(accessory  
occupancies, nonseparated occupancies, and separated occupancies\). Since each story is to be  
evaluated independently in a multistory condition, it is possible for the designer to utilize  
different mixed-occupancy options on various stories within the building.  
506.3 Frontage increase. The initial requirement of the code, insofar as a frontage increase is  
concerned, is that it adjoin or have access to a public way. Thus, the structure could extend  
completely between side lot lines and to the rear lot line, and be provided with access from only  
the front of the building, and still potentially be eligible for a small frontage increase. Therefore,  
it follows that if a building is provided with frontage consisting of public ways and/or open space  
for an increased portion of the perimeter of the building, some benefit should accrue based on  
better access for the fire department. Also, if the yards or public ways are wide enough, there  
will be a benefit that is due to the decreased exposure from adjoining properties.  
Because of the beneficial aspects of open space adjacent to a building, the IBC permits  
increases in the tabular areas established from Table 506.2 based on the amount of open  
perimeter and width of the open space and public ways surrounding the building. For any open  
space to be effective for use by the fire department, it is mandated that it be accessed from a  
public way or a fire lane so that the fire department will have access to that portion of the  
perimeter of the building that is adjacent to open space. See Figure 506-4.  
Open space and public ways—what can and cannot be used. In addition to allowances for  
public ways, the IBC uses the term open space where related to frontage increases in the  
determination of allowable floor areas. Although the term open space is not specifically defined  
in the IBC, the definition of a yard is an open space unobstructed from the ground to the sky that  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationis located on the lot on which the building is situated. It is logical that this definition is consistent  
with the intended description of open space. This definition seems to preclude the storage of  
pallets, lumber, manufactured goods, home improvement materials, or any other objects that  
similarly obstruct the open space. However, it would seem reasonable to permit automobile  
parking, low-profile landscaping, fire hydrants, light standards, and similar features to occupy  
the open space. These types of obstructions can be found within the public way, so their  
allowance within the open space provides for consistency. Because a yard must be unobstructed  
from the ground to the sky, open space widths should be measured from the edge of roof  
overhangs or other projections, as shown in Figure 506-5.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 506-3  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 506-4 Open space access.  
Regarding the use of public ways for providing frontage increases, the width of public way  
that should be used for determining area increases seems to cause confusion. Should the full  
width of the public way or only the distance to the centerline be used? The confusion evolves  
from the definition of fire separation distance as established in Chapter 2, which states that fire  
separation distance is measured from the building face to the centerline of a street, alley, or  
public way. However, the requirement to use the centerline is limited to fire separation distance  
and is not applicable to Section 506.3. For determining frontage increases for open space, the full  
width of the public way may be used by buildings located on both sides of the public way as  
expressed in Item 2 of Section 506.3.2.  
Figure 506-5 Measurement of open space.  
The following type of question is also sometimes asked\: “Why cannot I use the big open field  
next door for an area increase?” Section 506.3.1 specifically mandates that open space used for a  
frontage increase must be on the same lot as the building under consideration, or alternatively,  
dedicated for public use. There is a good reason for this limitation, insofar as the owner of one  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationparcel lacks control over a parcel owned by another and, thus, the open space can disappear  
when the owner of “the big open field” decides to build on it. One method by which some  
jurisdictions have allowed such large open spaces to be used is by accepting joint use of shared  
yards. It is typically necessary that a recorded restrictive covenant be executed to ensure that the  
shared space will remain open and unoccupied as long as it is required by the code. The creation  
of a no-build zone does not seem unreasonable insofar as the aim is to maintain open spaces  
between buildings. Any covenant should be reviewed by legal counsel to be sure it will  
accomplish what is intended. In addition, it should clearly describe the reason and applicable  
code section so that any future revisions or deletions may be considered if the owners wish to  
terminate such an agreement. In such an event, each building should be brought into current code  
compliance, or the agreement would be required to remain in effect.  
Whereas use of a public way as open space is permitted by the IBC, other publicly owned  
property is generally not, because the building official usually has no control over the long-range  
use of publicly owned property, and there is little assurance that such property will be available  
as open space for the life of the building. Remember that what is today’s publicly owned open  
parking lot could become tomorrow’s new city hall, and the open space used to justify area  
increases would no longer exist. Whereas Section 506.3.1 allows publicly owned property to be  
considered open space, the intent is such that the property be permanently dedicated for public  
use and maintained as unobstructed. The term public way was used in place of streets because its  
definition allows the use of a broader range of publicly owned open space while still allowing the  
building official some discretion as to the acceptability of a particular parcel. Public way usually  
conjures up visions of streets and alleys, but how about other open spaces such as power line  
right-of-ways, flood-control channels, or railroad rights-of-way? Many such open spaces are  
generally acceptable, provided there is a good probability that they will remain as open space  
during the life of the building for which they will serve. Power lines and flood-control channels  
are usually good bets for longevity, but railroad routes are often abandoned and, therefore, may  
not be as good a bet. There is also an expectation that the public way is maintained in an  
unobstructed condition to allow for fire department access, which potentially would disallow the  
use of waterways and similar features. If the public way does not provide for fire department  
access, its use for a frontage increase is prohibited. It should be noted that the definition for  
public way requires any such public parcel of land, other than a street or alley, to lead to a street.  
Figure 506-6 provides a visual summary of open space and public ways that could be used for  
open-space area increases.  
How much increase? Where public ways or open space having a minimum width of 20 feet  
\(6,096 mm\) adjoin at least 25 percent of the building’s perimeter, the code permits an increase in  
the building’s allowable area per story as established in Table 506.2. The area increase that is  
due to frontage \(If \) can be determined through the application of Table 506.3.3. The increase is  
based on two criteria\: \(1\) the percentage of the building’s perimeter that has open space or public  
ways of at least 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) in width, and \(2\) the smallest of such open space or public  
ways that is 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) or more wide.  
Based on the table, the maximum area increase permitted is 75 percent \(If of 0.75\) of the NS  
tabular area factor set forth in Table 506.2 as shown in Application Example 506-4. In order to  
receive the maximum increase permitted by the IBC, at least 75 percent of the entire perimeter of  
the building must adjoin a public way or open space having a width of at least 30 feet \(9,144  
mm\). Where a lesser amount of the perimeter has adequate open area, or where some portions of  
the complying open space are less than 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) in width, or both, the area increase  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfor frontage will be reduced as illustrated in Application Examples 506-5 and 506-6.  
Figure 506-6 Yards and public ways available for area increases.  
Whereas 75 percent is generally the largest allowable frontage increase, a greater area  
increase is permitted for those buildings that comply with all of the requirements for unlimited-  
area buildings as described in Section 507, other than compliance with the 60-foot \(18,288-mm\)  
open space or public way requirement. Where such a condition exists, Table 506.3.3.1 is to be  
applied.  
A maximum frontage increase of 150 percent can be achieved based on at least 75 percent of  
the perimeter being open with a minimum width of 55 feet \(16,764 mm\). Once 60 feet \(18,288  
mm\) of accessible open space and public ways is obtained for 100 percent of the building’s  
perimeter, the provisions of Section 507 are applicable and Table 506.3.3.1 need not be used. An  
example of the increased frontage increase is shown in Application Example 506-7  
It is necessary to make two assumptions when applying Table 506.3.3.1. The frontage  
increase \(If\) should be based on the smallest public way or open space that is 30 feet \(9,144 mm\)  
or more in width. In addition, where the smallest public way or open space of more than 30 feet  
\(9,144 mm\) in width is also 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) or more in width, the column identified as “55  
to less than 60” feet of open space should be applied.  
Must all qualifying open space be considered? When applying Table 506.3.3, it may be  
advantageous for the designer to not consider portions of the open space that are 20 feet \(6,096  
mm\) or more in width. By electing not to take credit for a qualifying yard, there are situations  
where the frontage increase \(If\) will be greater than if all yards with a width of at least 20 feet  
\(6,096 mm\) are considered. It is acceptable to ignore any open space where its inclusion in the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationapplication of Tables 506.3.3 will result in a smaller frontage increase.  
Application Example 506-4  
The same approach may be taken when Table 506.3.3.1 is applied. It may be advantageous for  
the designer to not consider portions of the open space that are 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) or more in  
width. An example is illustrated in Application Example 506-7.  
How must access be provided to an open space? The IBC provides no details as to the degree  
of fire department access required in order to consider open space for an allowable area increase;  
it only mandates that access be provided from a street or approved fire lane. It is clearly not the  
intent of the provisions to mandate a street or fire lane in the complying open space around a  
building in order to acquire the maximum frontage increase. However, fire personnel access from  
such streets or fire lanes is necessary. Although it is not a requirement to provide access around a  
building for fire department apparatus, other than that required by IFC Section 503.1.1, the  
frontage increase is based on the ability of fire personnel to physically approach the building’s  
exterior under reasonable conditions. For example, where the space adjacent to the building is  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationheavily forested or steeply sloped, the frontage increase addressed in Section 506.3 is not  
permitted. The presence of a lake or similar water feature next to a building would also reduce or  
prohibit an area increase. The evaluation of each individual building and its site conditions is  
necessary to properly apply the code for fire department access.  
Application Example 506-5  
Section 507 Unlimited-Area Buildings  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThere are many cases where very large undivided floor areas are required for efficient operation  
in such facilities as warehouses and industrial plants. Through the use of adequate safeguards,  
the IBC recognizes this necessity and allows unlimited areas for these uses under various  
circumstances. Large open floor space is also desirable for other applications; therefore, such  
allowances are also permitted for business and mercantile occupancies, as well as specific  
assembly and educational uses. The use of this section is typically intended to eliminate fire-  
resistive construction of the building that would be mandated based on the area limitations of  
Section 506. Contrary to the general philosophy that as a building increases in floor area the  
allowable types of construction become more restrictive, many of the unlimited-area uses permit  
the use of any construction type.  
Application Example 506-6  
It is important to remember that Section 507 is not the only means under which a building can  
be unlimited in floor area. Those buildings containing occupancies other than Groups H-1 and H-  
2 may be unlimited in area where built of Type IA construction as set forth in Table 506.2. In  
addition, unlimited area Type IB buildings are permitted for a significant number of moderate-  
and low-hazard occupancies. Section 503.1.1 also permits unlimited floor areas in special  
industrial occupancies that require large areas to accommodate equipment and processes.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation507.1 General. Historically, structures constructed under the provisions for unlimited area have  
performed quite well in regard to fire and life safety. A number of occupancy groups, particularly  
those relating to institutional, residential, and high-hazard occupancies, are excluded from the  
benefits derived from the provisions for unlimited-area buildings. Such occupancies pose  
unacceptable risks that are due to their unique characteristics. As a general rule, only those  
occupancy classifications specifically identified in this section are permitted to be housed in  
buildings allowed to be unlimited in area by Section 507. For example, Group I occupancies are  
not specifically permitted by any of the provisions addressing unlimited-area buildings.  
Therefore, it would appear no amount of Group I is permitted in such structures. However,  
Section 507.1.1 identifies the method that allows for a limited degree of such prohibited  
occupancies. Section 508.2.3 indicates that the allowable area for an accessory occupancy is to  
be based on the allowable area of the main occupancy. If the main occupancy is permitted by  
Section 507 to be in an unlimited-area building, a complying accessory occupancy also enjoys  
the same benefit. Figure 507-1 illustrates this condition.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 506-7  
It is also not uncommon for two or more occupancies regulated under the provisions of  
Section 507 to be located within the same building. For example, assume a one-story building  
contains a Group M furniture store and its associated Group S-1 warehouse. Because both Group  
M and Group S-1 occupancies are permitted in an unlimited-area building complying with  
Section 507.4, both occupancies are permitted to be located in the same unlimited-area building.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSee Figure 507-2. Any fire-resistive separation requirement would be based on the applicable  
mixed-occupancy method of Section 508 applied to the building.  
Figure 507-1 Accessory occupancy in an unlimited-area building.  
All buildings regulated under the unlimited-area building provisions of Section 507 are  
required to be surrounded by public ways and yards of substantial width. This continuous open  
space provides a means for the fire service to access the building as necessary from the exterior,  
while at the same time maintains a sizable separation from any other structures on the site. The  
required open space is to be measured from all points along the building’s exterior wall in all  
directions, ensuring that the full perimeter of the building is provided with continuous open  
space. See Figure 507-3. This differs somewhat from the right-angle method established for an  
allowable area frontage increase as set forth in Section 506.3 where such continuity of open  
space is not required at the building corners. Consistent with the measurement method of Section  
506.3 to gain a frontage increase, the open space width adjacent to those exterior walls fronting  
on a public way is permitted to include the entire width of the public way.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 507-2 Mixed-occupancy unlimited-area buildings.  
507.2.1 Reduced open space. There may be situations where the full 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) of  
open space or public ways surrounding an unlimited-area building cannot be obtained or its use  
is undesirable. The IBC permits a reduction in the required open space under very specific  
conditions, as illustrated in Figure 507-4. In no case may the permanent open space be reduced to  
less than 40 feet \(12,192 mm\) in width. By limiting the amount of reduced open space, requiring  
a high degree of exterior wall fire resistance, and mandating opening protectives in all openings  
in the exterior wall facing the reduced open space, the code provides protection equivalent to full  
60-foot \(18,288-mm\) yards or public ways. A final point\: The permitted reduction in open space  
is only applicable to specific portions of Section 507. Although the allowance is not identified as  
acceptable for buildings complying with Section 507.7, it would seem the reduction could also  
be viewed as appropriate since Section 507.7 is a companion provision to Section 507.6.  
507.3 Nonsprinklered, one-story buildings. This section addresses a Group F-2 or S-2  
occupancy in a one-story building of any type of construction. Both Group F-2 and S-2  
occupancies by definition are low-hazard manufacturing or storage uses, which the code  
considers to be low fire risks. Fire risk is further reduced by requiring that the building be  
surrounded by yards or streets with a minimum width of 60 feet \(18,288 mm\). The relatively low  
fire loading expected in such occupancies is why the code does not require the installation of an  
automatic fire-sprinkler system for this application. The use of this provision is applicable to  
buildings of all construction types; however, it is anticipated that the structure will mirror the  
contents in the absence of combustible elements.  
507.4 Sprinklered, one story buildings. Specific moderate-hazard occupancies, limited to  
Groups B, F, M, and S, are permitted single-story buildings of unlimited area where the building  
is completely surrounded by streets or yards not less than 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) in width and the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationentire structure is protected by an automatic fire-sprinkler system. The limitation of one story  
does not apply where the building is utilized for rack storage, provided the building is of  
noncombustible construction, and is not intended for public access. This unlimited-area storage  
facility, required to conform with Chapter 32 of the IFC, is permitted to be of any height.  
Figure 507-3 Open space measurement for unlimited-area building.  
In most applications, the use of the unlimited-area provisions simply means that the type of  
construction is not regulated, regardless of the size of the building’s floor area. The code  
assumes that the amount of combustibles and, consequently, the potential fire severity are  
relatively moderate. In addition, the protection provided by the automatic fire-sprinkler system  
plus the fire-department access furnished by the 60-foot \(18,288-mm\) yards or streets  
surrounding the building reduce the potential fire severity to such a level that unlimited area is  
reasonable.  
One-story Group A-4 occupancies are also permitted to be of unlimited area where a sprinkler  
system is provided throughout and a minimum 60-foot \(18,288-mm\) open space surrounds the  
building. However, because of the increased risk posed by the anticipated high number and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconcentration of occupants in such a structure, the construction type of the building is limited to  
Type I, II, III, or IV. The automatic sprinkler system required in an unlimited-area building  
housing a Group A-4 occupancy may be omitted in those specific areas occupied by indoor  
participant sports, including tennis, skating, swimming, and equestrian activities. Such an  
omission mandates that exit doors from the participant sports areas lead directly to the outside,  
and the installation of a fire-alarm system with manual fire-alarm boxes is required. It is  
anticipated that such sports areas will have little, if any, combustible loading if the uses are  
limited to those described in the code. If there is a reasonable expectation that other types of uses  
could occur, it would be inappropriate to omit the sprinkler system in such areas.  
Group A-1 and A-2 occupancies are permitted in a mixed-occupancy building when in  
compliance with the general limitations of Section 507.4 plus additional criteria as established in  
Section 507.4.1. This allowance does not grant the designated Group A occupancies unlimited  
area, but rather allows such assembly occupancies to be located within a Group B, F, M, S, or A-  
4 unlimited-area building under specified conditions. The building must be classified as Type I,  
II, III, or IV construction. In addition, the Group A-1 and A-2 assembly occupancies must be  
separated with fire barriers from other occupancies within the building, in accordance with the  
separated occupancy provisions of Section 508.4.4. For example, in an unlimited-area retail sales  
building, a Group A-2 restaurant would be required to be separated from a Group M sales tenant  
by a minimum 2-hour fire-resistance-rated fire barrier. No reduction in the minimum required  
fire-resistance rating of the fire barrier is permitted for the presence of an automatic sprinkler  
system. Each individual Group A tenant would also be limited in area by the provisions of  
Section 506. No additional height increases would apply to the Group A occupancies because of  
the specific Section 507.4 limitation of one story for the entire building. An additional  
requirement mandates that all required means of egress from the assembly spaces exit directly to  
the exterior of the building. See Figure 507-5. Application of this provision does not require the  
assembly occupancy to be accessory to the major use of the building, nor is the assembly floor  
area limited to 10 percent of the floor area. As an additional note, it would seem appropriate that  
the provision also extend to Group A-3 occupancies, as such uses are typically considered equal  
or lesser in hazard level to the Group A-1 and A-2 classifications.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 507-4 Reduced open space.  
507.5 Two-story buildings. In Groups B, F, M, and S, the unlimited-area provisions also apply  
to structures that are two stories in height. Minimum 60-foot \(18,288-mm\) open space or public  
ways must surround the building, and an automatic fire-sprinkler system is required throughout  
the structure.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 507-5 Group A occupancies in unlimited-area buildings.  
507.6 Group A-3 buildings of Type II construction. Although most assembly occupancies are  
viewed as relatively high hazard because of the concerns associated with the number and  
concentration of the occupants, certain types of uses classified as Group A-3 occupancies are  
considered as moderate hazard. Therefore, it is possible to utilize the unlimited-area provisions  
for specific Group A-3 uses where the specified criteria are met.  
Such buildings allowed to be of unlimited area are limited to one story in height, must be of  
Type II noncombustible construction, and contain only those specific types of assembly uses  
listed in the code. By limiting the types of buildings to places of religious worship, gymnasiums  
\(without spectator seating\), lecture halls, and similar uses, it is anticipated that the fire loading is  
relatively low. Buildings such as libraries, museums, and similar uses pose a higher risk that is  
due to the large amount of combustibles expected to be present. The potential for combustible  
loading is further reduced by the prohibition of a stage as a part of the use, although a platform is  
acceptable. Installation of an automatic sprinkler system is mandated, as is the presence of a  
minimum 60-foot \(18,288-mm\) open space around the building.  
507.7 Group A-3 buildings of Types III and IV construction. Buildings of Type III or IV  
construction are granted unlimited-area status when housing specified Group A-4 occupancies in  
a manner similar to those Type II buildings identified in Section 507.6. The same requirements  
apply for sprinkler protection and adequate open space. In addition, the assembly use must be  
located relatively close to the exterior ground level to expedite the exiting process. As a part of  
this requirement, any elevation change from the building to the grade level must be  
accomplished by ramps rather than stairs. This further provides for an efficient means of egress  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfrom the assembly building. The additional limitation regarding floor-level location is mandated  
due to the combustible nature of the building’s construction.  
507.8 Group H occupancies. Because many large industrial operations, both manufacturing and  
warehousing, have a need to utilize a limited quantity of high-hazard materials in some manner,  
it is necessary that Group H-2, H-3, and H-4 occupancies be permitted to a small degree in  
Group F and S unlimited-area buildings. Because of the allowances given to buildings of  
unlimited area, it is critical that the high-hazard occupancies be strictly limited in floor area and  
adequately separated from the remainder of the building.  
There are four factors that limit the allowable floor area of the permitted Group H  
occupancies\: the specific classification of the Group H occupancy, the building’s type of  
construction, its floor area, and the location of the high-hazard uses in relationship to the  
building’s exterior wall. Where high-hazard occupancies are located on the perimeter of the  
building, fire-department access is enhanced, and exposure to interior areas is reduced.  
Accordingly, the permitted floor area of the Group H occupancies located on the building’s  
perimeter is considerably greater than that allowed for such high-hazard uses completely  
surrounded by other interior portions of the unlimited-area building.  
Where Group H-2, H-3, and H-4 occupancies are located at the perimeter of the unlimited-  
area Group F or Group S building, their size is restricted by the area limitations of Section 506.  
In a condition where the high-hazard occupancy is totally enclosed by the unlimited-area  
building, the size of the Group H occupancy is limited to only 25 percent of the area limitations  
specified in Section 506. Both of these conditions are shown in Application Example 507-1. The  
example also illustrates that multiple Group H occupancies that are not located at the perimeter  
of the building are limited in size based on the aggregate floor area of such occupancies.  
Similarly, where multiple Group H occupancies do occur on the building’s perimeter, the  
maximum permitted size is also based on the total of all such occupancies. In all situations, the  
appropriate fire-barrier assemblies mandated by Table 508.4 must be provided. Regardless of the  
location of the applicable Group H occupancies, in no case may such aggregate floor areas  
exceed 10 percent of the area of the entire building. The provisions addressing liquid use, mixing  
and dispensing rooms, liquid storage rooms, and spray-paint booths simply replicate those of  
Sections 415.6.1, 415.6.2, and 415.6.3, in order to remind code users of the limitations and  
allowances placed on such rooms and areas.  
507.9 Unlimited mixed-occupancy buildings with Group H-5. The Group H-5 classification  
was created some time ago to standardize regulations for semiconductor manufacturing facilities.  
The Group H-5 category requires engineering and fire-safety controls that reduce the overall  
hazard of the occupancy to a level regarded to be equivalent to that of a moderate-hazard Group  
B occupancy. The mitigating provisions of Section 415.11 have effectively equalized the two  
occupancies in terms of relative hazard such that, in concert with the three additional criteria  
established in this section, the allowance for Group H-5 unlimited-area buildings is deemed to be  
appropriate.  
A unique condition not applied to other unlimited-area buildings regulated by Section 507 is  
the need to limit the unseparated floor area of Group H-5 use. Although an unlimited amount of  
Group H-5 floor area is permitted within a complying unlimited-area building, it may be  
necessary to subdivide the floor area using minimum 2-hour separations due to the limits of Item  
3\. An application of the provisions and the required fire barrier separations is illustrated in Figure  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation507-6.  
Application Example 507-1  
507.10 Aircraft paint hangar. The provisions of Section 412.5 address aircraft painting  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationoperations where the amount of flammable liquids in use exceeds those maximum allowable  
quantities listed in Table 307.1\(1\). Classified as Group H-2, such aircraft paint hangars must be  
fully suppressed in accordance with NFPA 409 and of noncombustible construction. One-story  
hangars may be unlimited in floor area where complying with Section 412.5, provided they are  
surrounded by public ways or yards having a width of at least one and one-half times the height  
of the building.  
Figure 507-6 Unlimited area Group H-5 building example.  
507.11 Group E buildings. Because of the various fire- and life-safety concerns associated with  
educational occupancies, buildings housing uses classified as Group E are typically not eligible  
for consideration as unlimited-area buildings. Only when the following six criteria are met does  
the IBC permits the area of a Group E educational building to be unlimited based on Section 507.  
1\. 2. 3. 4. The building is limited to one story above grade plane.  
The building is of Type II, IIIA, or IV construction.  
Two or more means of egress are provided from each classroom.  
At least one means of egress from each classroom is a direct exit to the exterior of the  
building.  
5\. 6. An automatic sprinkler system is provided throughout the building.  
The building is surrounded by open space at least 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) in width.  
507.12 Motion-picture theaters. Because of their limited combustible loading, motion-picture  
theaters are granted unlimited floor areas in a manner relatively consistent with other moderate-  
hazard uses. This specific allowance is not extended to the other uses classified as Group A-1,  
such as performance theaters, because of their higher fire-severity potential.  
In order to address the concerns related to the high-density, high-volume occupant loads often  
encountered in motion-picture theaters, unlimited area is not permitted where the building is of  
Type III, IV, and V combustible construction. This restriction further limits the fire load  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcontained within the building construction. In concert with Section 507.4, a fire-sprinkler system  
must be installed throughout, and minimum 60-foot \(18,288-mm\) open areas must completely  
surround the building.  
The application of this provision differs from the allowance granted in Section 507.4.1. That  
provision permits any Group A-1 occupancy, including motion-picture theaters, to be located in  
an unlimited-area building complying with Section 507.4, provided the limitations of the  
exception are met. However, it does not allow Group A-1 occupancies themselves to be  
unlimited in area. On the other hand, this section permits a Group A-1 theater complex to be  
unlimited in area, provided it is fully sprinklered, of Type II construction, and surrounded by  
adequate open space.  
507.13 Covered and open mall buildings and anchor buildings. The provisions of Section 402  
for unlimited-area covered and open mall buildings are referenced for convenience purposes.  
Note that although the reduction in open space permitted by Section 507.2.1 is not applicable to  
covered or open mall buildings, a similar reduction is permitted by the exception to Section  
402.2.  
Section 508 Mixed Use and Occupancy  
Multiple uses commonly occur within a single building. Each use creates its own distinct  
hazards, many of which are addressed by the code. However, many of the hazards are similar in  
nature, which allows the varied uses to be grouped into categories that recognize the common  
concerns. These categories are identified in Chapter 3 as occupancy groups. Where two or more  
occupancy groups share a single building, it is necessary to evaluate their relationship to each  
other as a mixed-occupancy condition. This section provides various methods to address such  
relationships in regard to occupancy classification, allowable height and area, fire protection  
systems, and fire-resistance-rated separation.  
It should be noted that live/work uses as addressed under the provisions of Section 508.5 are  
not to be regulated as mixed-occupancy conditions. Section 508.5.1 indicates that live/work units  
are to be classified as a single occupancy, a Group R-2. As such, the Section 508.5 essentially  
becomes an exception to applying the mixed occupancy requirements of Section 508.  
508.1 General. A mixed-occupancy condition exists where two or more distinct occupancy  
groups are determined to exist within the same building. In fact, it is quite common for a  
building to contain more than one occupancy group. For example, hotel buildings of various  
sizes not only house the residential sleeping areas, but may contain administrative offices, retail  
and service-oriented spaces, parking garages, and, in many cases, restaurants, conference rooms,  
and other assembly areas. Each of these uses typically constitutes a distinct and separate  
occupancy as far as Chapter 3 of the IBC is concerned. Because this situation is not uncommon,  
the code specifies requirements for buildings of mixed occupancies. Under such circumstances,  
the designer has available several methodologies \(accessory occupancies, nonseparated  
occupancies, and separated occupancies\) to address the mixed-occupancy concerns. The methods  
that have been established represent a hierarchy of design prerogatives that may be utilized at the  
discretion of the design professional. Although compliance is required with only one of the three  
mixed-occupancy methods, it is acceptable to utilize two or even all three methods in the same  
building, as shown in Figure 508-1. The common format utilized in presenting the requirements  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfor each of the methods allows for a comparison of the provisions. This should assist in  
determining the most appropriate method, or methods, for the building under consideration. A  
simple comparison of the three mixed-occupancies methods is shown in Figure 508-2.  
Figure 508-1 Combination of methods.  
It is important to recognize that there is no relationship between the mixed-occupancy  
provisions of Section 508.4 and the fire area concept utilized in Section 903.2 for automatic  
sprinkler systems. As set forth in Section 508.4.1, compliance with any of the three mixed-  
occupancy methods does not relieve the responsibility to comply with Section 901.7 and Table  
707.3.10 regarding the proper separation of fire areas. An example is shown in Figure 508-3.  
Figure 508-2 Summary of mixed-occupancy methods.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 508-3 Occupancy separation versus fire area separation example.  
508.2 Accessory occupancies. Those minor uses in a building that are not considered consistent  
with the major occupancy designation can potentially be considered accessory occupancies. They  
often are necessary or complimentary to the function of the building’s major use, but have few  
characteristics of the major occupancy in regard to fire hazards and other concerns. Therefore,  
accessory occupancies must each be assigned to an occupancy group established in Chapter 3  
based on their own unique characteristics. While maintaining the philosophy of a mixed-  
occupancy building, this section permits such relatively small accessory occupancies to be  
considered merely a portion of the major occupancy for fire separation purposes. A good  
example would be a lunchroom seating 120 persons and located in a large manufacturing facility.  
Whereas the individuals using the lunchroom are generally the same individuals who work  
elsewhere in the factory, the hazards encountered while they are occupying the lunchroom are  
quite different from those created in the Group F-1 manufacturing environment. Therefore, the  
lunchroom must be appropriately classified as a Group A-2 occupancy, creating a mixed-  
occupancy condition. However, through compliance with the accessory occupancy provisions of  
this section, the need for a fire-resistance-rated separation between the lunchroom and  
manufacturing area is eliminated. In fact, no physical separation of any kind would be mandated.  
It is important to note, however, that in spite of the absence of a fire separation, the two areas  
would maintain their unique occupancy classifications. They would continue to be classified as  
Groups A-2 and F-1, respectively, and the building would be considered a mixed occupancy.  
As previously indicated, consideration as an accessory occupancy is only possible where the  
occupancy is subsidiary to the main occupancy of the building. There are several additional  
criteria that must also be met in order to utilize the accessory occupancy method. The occupancy  
under consideration cannot exceed 10 percent of the floor area of the story on which the  
accessory occupancy is located, nor more than that permitted by Table 506.2 for NS buildings.  
See Figure 508-4. It is specified that the 10 percent limitation is based on the aggregate floor  
areas of all accessory use areas, not individually. Multiple minor occupancies that cumulatively  
make up more than 10 percent of the total floor area could pose a hazard that the code does not  
anticipate. There are unique situations—such as where minor occupancies are adequately  
separated spatially or are of such different types of uses that their aggregate area is not relevant  
—where the regulation of minor uses as individual areas could potentially be considered. See  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 508-5. The application of these limits is subject to the interpretation of the building  
official, based on conditions unique to each building under consideration. The general limitations  
applied to accessory occupancies are shown in Application Example 508-1. There is limited  
guidance in the code as to the determination of the allowable location of an accessory occupancy  
in a multistory building. The provisions address the building as a whole, with a reference to  
Section 504. In applying Section 504.2 addressing all mixed occupancies, it follows that the  
accessory occupancy cannot be located higher than that permitted by Table 504.4 for the main  
occupancy as illustrated in Figure 508-6.  
Figure 508-4 Aggregate accessory occupancies example.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 508-5 Individual accessory occupancies example.  
Figure 508-6 Maximum height of accessory occupancy example.  
Although the primary allowance provided by the accessory occupancy provisions is the lack  
of a required fire separation between the accessory occupancy and the remainder of the building,  
there is also a potential benefit that is due to the manner in which allowable area is regulated.  
The code calls for the allowable area of the accessory occupancy to be based on the main  
occupancy of the building. This approach typically allows for a greater allowable area than  
would be permitted under the conditions for both nonseparated occupancies and separated  
occupancies. Another important benefit provides for occupancies not normally permitted in  
unlimited-area buildings, as regulated by Section 507, to be located in such buildings. This  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationallowance is established in Section 507.1.1. For example, a Group A-2 lunchroom considered an  
accessory occupancy may be located in a two-story Group B unlimited-area building complying  
with Section 507.5 with no separation required between the two occupancies. This allowance,  
along with the limitations for accessory occupancies, is shown in Application Example 508-2.  
Application Example 508-1  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 508-2  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTwo exceptions indicate those conditions related to accessory occupancies under which some  
degree of fire-resistance-rated separation is mandated. The first exception indicates that the fire  
separation cannot be eliminated where the accessory occupancy is classified as Group H-2, H-3,  
H-4, or H-5. Where such occupancies occur in a mixed-occupancy building, it is necessary to  
apply the separated occupancy provisions of Section 508.4.4. Note that the Group H occupancy  
can continue to be considered as an accessory occupancy, where applicable, and take advantage  
of the other allowances provided by Section 508.2. The second exception mandates that the  
separation elements addressed in Section 420 for buildings containing dwelling units and  
sleeping units be provided. The use of the accessory occupancy methodology does not override  
the requirements for fire partition and/or horizontal assembly separations required in Group I-1,  
R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 occupancies. The application to Group R-4 occupancies, while not set  
forth in the exception, is established by the second paragraph of Section 310.5  
508.3 Nonseparated occupancies. This section presents another of the available methods  
addressing the relationship between different occupancies in a mixed-occupancy building. Under  
the specific conditions of this methodology, fire-resistance-rated separations are not mandated  
between adjacent occupancies. The fundamental concept behind this provision assumes that if  
the building is designed in part to address the most restrictive and most hazardous conditions that  
are expected to occur based on the occupancies contained in the building, a fire-resistance-rated  
separation is not needed. In fact, no physical separation of any type is required.  
Utilizing the nonseparated-occupancy method, the building must be individually classified for  
each unique occupancy that exists. The height and area limitations for those occupancies will be  
used to determine the required type of construction for each occupancy, with the most restrictive  
type of construction required for the entire building. In addition, the most restrictive fire-  
protection system requirements \(automatic sprinkler systems and fire alarm systems\) that apply  
to an occupancy in the building shall apply to the entire structure. For the application of other  
code provisions, each individual occupancy will be regulated by only the specific requirements  
related to that occupancy. A special condition mandates that if a high-rise building is regulated  
under the nonseparated-occupancy provisions, even those portions of the building that are not  
considered high rise must comply with the high-rise requirements. See Figure 508-7. Another  
important limitation is that the use of the nonseparated-occupancy method is significantly limited  
for Group H-2, H-3, H-4, and H-5 occupancies. The key benefit of this mixed-occupancy method  
is not available because occupancy separations as established in Table 508.4 must be provided  
where applicable. In addition, the nonseparated-occupancy provisions cannot be utilized to  
eliminate any required dwelling unit or sleeping unit separation required under the special  
provisions of Section 420.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 508-7 Nonseparated occupancies in a high-rise building.  
The approach to understanding the rationale for the nonseparated-occupancy method may be  
better understood by viewing the structure as multiple single-use facilities. In evaluating the  
building described in Application Example 508-3, assume that the building is entirely a Group B  
occupancy. Based on that assumption, determine its maximum allowable height and area, as well  
as any required fire protection features. Now evaluate the building as if it were entirely a Group  
E occupancy, again addressing the maximum allowable height and area, along with the  
requirements for fire protection systems. By applying the most restrictive height, area, and fire  
protection provisions of both Group B and E occupancies to the entire building, the conditions  
for nonseparated occupancies can be determined.  
Where no fire separation is provided between a Group I-2, Condition 2 occupancy and other  
occupancies in the building due to the application of the nonseparated occupancy provisions, it is  
important that some critical fire protection features be extended beyond the healthcare portion of  
the building. Many of these restrictions directly support the defend-in-place concept that  
hospitals rely on. Within an individual fire area containing a Group I-2, Condition 2 occupancy,  
the more restrictive provisions of Sections 407, 509, and 712 apply to all occupancies within the  
fire area. In addition, the more restrictive means of egress provisions apply to the entire path of  
egress from the Group I-2, Condition 2 occupancy until arriving at the public way.  
Section 407 contains provisions that are specific to Group I-2 occupancies that may not  
necessarily apply to the entire building. Within the fire area that contains the Group I-2,  
Condition 2 occupancy, safeguards including those for corridor construction, smoke  
compartmentation and hospital-specific egress must be maintained in order to support the  
defend-in-place concept. Separation and/or protection requirements for incidental uses that are  
specific to Group I-2 occupancies as established in Section 509 must also be provided where  
such uses occur within other occupancies in the same fire area as the hospital use. The vertical  
opening limitations set forth in Section 712 for Group I-2 occupancies must also be applied to  
other occupancies in the same fire area, addressing the concern of unprotected vertical openings  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbetween adjacent stories. In all cases, the most restrictive applicable provisions of Sections 407,  
509, and 712 are to be applied where one of the nonseparated occupancies is a Group I-2,  
Condition 2.  
Means of egress concepts such as the minimum width appropriate for stretcher and bed traffic  
must be applied from the hospital area through the exit discharge. This mandate is addressed in a  
general sense by Section 1004.4 indicating that where two or more occupancies utilize portions  
of the same means of egress system, those egress components shall meet the more stringent  
requirements of all occupancies that are served.  
508.4 Separated occupancies. Using this method of addressing mixed-occupancy buildings, the  
code directs that each portion of the building housing a separate occupancy be individually  
classified and comply with the requirements for that specific occupancy. Furthermore, the code  
intends that each pair of adjacent occupancies be evaluated through Table 508.4 as to the  
relationship of the hazards involved, often mandating a fire-resistance-rated separation between  
them. The allowable number of stories above grade plane for each occupancy is independently  
regulated based on Table 504.4 based on the type of construction of the building. See Figure  
508-8.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 508-3  
Figure 508-8 Maximum height of separated occupancies example.  
For allowable floor-area considerations in a building having multiple occupancies, the code  
uses a formula that is very similar to the interaction formula used in structural engineering where  
two different types of stress are imposed on a member at the same time.  
In the case of a mixed-occupancy building, the code uses this type of formula for the  
calculation of the allowable building area for each floor. For example, if there are three different  
occupancies in a building, the formula is as follows\:  
a1/A1+ a2/A2 + a3/A3 ≤ 1.0  
WHERE\: a1, a2, and a3 represent the actual areas for the three separate occupancies, and A1,  
A2, and A3 represent the allowable areas for the three separate occupancies.  
See Application Examples 508-4 and 508-5 for examples of this computation.  
This formula essentially prorates the areas of the various occupancies so that the sum of  
percentages must not exceed 100 percent.  
It is also appropriate to utilize a variation of this formula for the determination of the  
allowable area for the total building as evidenced by the provisions of Section 506.2.4. See  
Application Example 506-3. For all practical purposes, the need to evaluate the building as a  
whole is only necessary in buildings of four or more stories above grade plane. For two- and  
three-story buildings, if each story is compliant for allowable area purposes, the entire building  
will always comply.  
Of special note is how the fire protection provisions of Chapter 9 are to be applied under the  
separated-occupancy method. Any fire sprinkler and fire alarm requirements applicable to an  
occupancy regulated as a separated occupancy are to be extended to all occupancies where no  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfire-resistance-rated separation is mandated by Table 508.4. As addressed in the specific  
discussion of Table 504.8, there are multiple combinations of occupancies where the table does  
not require a fire separation due to the similarity of the occupancies under consideration.  
Table 508.4 Required Separation of Occupancies. The code has established several alternative  
methods for addressing mixed-occupancy buildings regarding fire separations between the  
various occupancies involved. Both Sections 508.2.4 and 508.3.3 for accessory occupancies and  
nonseparated occupancies, respectively, do not require any fire-resistance-rated separation  
between occupancies. However, Table 508.4, establishing fire separations under the separated  
occupancy method of Section 508.4, indicates varying degrees of separation. Fire-resistive  
separations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours are selectively required based on the occupancies involved. In  
some cases, however, no fire separation is mandated. The intent of the table is to provide for  
relative separation requirements based primarily on dissimilar risk. The fire-resistance ratings,  
including the lack of such required ratings in many circumstances, appropriately recognize the  
degree of dissimilarity between the various occupancies.  
Application Example 508-4  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 508-5  
In a general sense, the following logic was utilized in formulating the table. High-hazard  
\(Group H\) occupancies are required to be separated from each other and from all other  
occupancies. Ordinary or moderate-hazard commercial/industrial \(Groups B, F-1, M, and S-1\)  
occupancies require no separation from each other; however, they are required to be separated  
from all other occupancies. People-intensive \(Groups A and E\) occupancies also require no  
occupancy separation between each other but must be separated from all other occupancies  
except for fully sprinklered Group F-2 and S-2 occupancies. Group R occupancies require no  
separation from other Group R occupancies, but such separations are mandated between all other  
occupancy classifications. Similar criteria apply to the Group I occupancies with a modification  
for Group I-2. The philosophy of the provisions set forth in the table dictates increased fire-  
resistance ratings on the basis of greater inherent dissimilar risk. Where Table 508.4 mandates  
some degree of occupancy separation, an occupancy shall be physically separated from the other  
occupancy through the use of fire barriers, horizontal assemblies, or a combination of both  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationvertical and horizontal fire-resistance-rated assemblies.  
In some cases, the rationale behind the use of fire-resistance-rated separations between  
incompatible occupancies concerns itself with the amount of combustibles encompassed in the  
adjoining occupancies and is termed in fire-protection circles as fire loading. Thus, if the amount  
of combustibles or fire loading in one occupancy is quite high while there is a limited fire load  
anticipated in the other occupancy, some degree of fire separation between the two distinct  
occupancies is necessary. However, the relationship of fire loads is not the only factor in  
determining an appropriate occupancy separation. In some cases, the separation is specified to be  
of 1 hour or more in duration mainly because of what the code implies to be incompatibility  
between the activities that occur within the two occupancies. For example, the code requires a  
separation of 1 hour between a Group I-2 occupancy and a Group S-2 occupancy in a fully  
sprinklered building. The limited amount of combustibles in either occupancy does not justify a  
fire-resistive separation; however, because of the presumed incompatibility between the two  
occupancies, the 1-hour separation is considered to be justified.  
As a general rule, a reduction of the fire-resistance ratings in Table 508.4 by 1 hour is  
permitted in buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system. The potential of  
a sizable fire spreading throughout a building is minimal under fully sprinklered conditions.  
The fire-resistance ratings set forth by the table are further modified by Footnote b. The  
required separation for storage occupancies may be reduced by 1 hour where the storage is  
limited to the parking of private or pleasure vehicles, but may never be less than 1 hour. It would  
seem the footnote would not apply where no separation is initially required. For example, where  
the two occupancies involved are Groups S-2 and U parking facilities, a fire-resistive separation  
between them would not be warranted.  
It is necessary to again emphasize that there is no relationship between the separated  
occupancy provisions of Section 508.4 and the fire area concept utilized in Section 903.2 for  
automatic sprinkler systems. Compliance with Table 508.4 does not relieve the responsibility to  
comply with Section 901.7 and Table 707.3.10 regarding the proper separation of fire areas. An  
example is shown in Figure 508-3.  
508.5 Live/work units. An increasingly popular concept of building use combines a residential  
unit with a small business activity. Residential live/work units typically include a dwelling unit  
along with some public service business, such as an artist’s studio, coffee shop, or chiropractor’s  
office. There may be a small number of employees working within the residence and the public  
is able to enter the work area of the unit to acquire service. Live/work units are a throwback to  
1900-era community planning where residents could walk to all of the needed services within  
their neighborhood. These types of units began to re-emerge in the 1990s through a development  
style known as “Traditional Neighborhood Design.  
” More recently, adaptive reuse of many older  
urban structures in city centers incorporated the same live/work tools to provide a variety of  
residential unit types. Provisions specifically addressing live/work units recognize the  
uniqueness of this type of use.  
By definition, a “live/work unit” is primarily residential in nature but has a sizable portion of  
the space devoted to nonresidential activities. Often service-related in nature, the nonresidential  
portion is limited in several respects. The unit itself, including both the residential and  
nonresidential portions, is limited to 3,000 square feet \(279 m2\) in total floor area. In addition,  
the nonresidential activities cannot take up more than 50 percent of the unit’s total floor area.  
The portion dedicated to nonresidential use must be located on the first floor of the unit, or where  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationapplicable, on the unit’s main floor level. In addition to the unit’s residents, a limit of five  
workers or employees is permitted at any one time. An overview of the limitations is shown in  
Figure 508-9.  
The occupancy classification of a live/work unit is Group R-2 based upon the primary use of  
the unit. Although differing uses are typically classified based on the characteristics of the  
varying uses involved and considered as mixed-occupancy conditions, in this case a single  
classification is considered acceptable. The potential hazards created due to the nonresidential  
uses are addressed through the special requirements of Section 508.5 that are to be applied in  
addition to those required due to the Group R-2 classification. Since live/work units are regulated  
as single-occupancy conditions, the provisions of Section 508 for mixed-occupancy buildings do  
not apply. Therefore, the application of Section 508.5 should be viewed as an exception to the  
mixed-occupancy requirements. In addition to the other limitations on use of a live/work unit,  
significant storage uses and those activities involving hazardous materials are prohibited. The  
increased fire load found in many storage uses is not considered in the live/work provisions, nor  
is the potential physical or health hazard that is due to the use or storage of hazardous materials.  
A very small amount of storage is permitted if it is deemed to be accessory to the nonresidential  
use.  
Figure 508-9 Live/work unit.  
Even though a live/work unit is classified as a Group R-2 occupancy, there are several issues  
where the residential and nonresidential portions are regulated independently. Structural floor  
loading conditions, accessibility features, and ventilation rates are all to be based on the  
individual function of each space within the unit, as are the design of the means of egress and the  
determination of required plumbing facilities. In all other cases, the provisions applicable to a  
Group R-2 occupancy are to be applied to the entire live/work unit.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 509 Incidental Uses  
There are times where the hazards associated with a particular use do not rise to the level of  
requiring a different occupancy classification; however, such hazards must still be addressed  
because of their impact on the remainder of the building. These functions are identified as  
incidental uses, which are regulated independently of the mixed-occupancy provisions.  
Incidental uses are uniquely addressed through the use of fire-resistance-rated separations or  
automatic sprinkler system protection.  
What is an incidental use? There are occasionally one or more rooms or areas in a building  
that pose risks not typically addressed by the provisions for the general occupancy group under  
which the building is classified. However, such rooms or areas may functionally be an extension  
of the primary use. These types of spaces are considered in the IBC to be incidental uses and are  
regulated according to their hazard level. These areas are not ever intended to be considered  
different occupancies, creating a mixed-occupancy condition, but rather are classified in  
accordance with the main occupancy of the portion of the building where the incidental use is  
located. There is no specific definition for an incidental use, as it is simply described as any of  
those rooms or areas listed in Table 509.1. If it is not listed, it is not considered an incidental use  
for code purposes.  
The designation and regulation of incidental uses do not apply to those areas within and  
serving a dwelling unit. Otherwise, the special hazards that may be found in buildings of various  
uses and occupancies are addressed through the construction of a fire barrier and/or horizontal  
assembly separating the incidental use from the remainder of the building, the installation of an  
automatic sprinkler system in the incidental use space, or, in special cases, both the fire  
separation and automatic sprinkler system.  
Incidental uses are listed in Table 509.1. Most of the rooms or areas identified in the table are  
regulated where located in any of the occupancy groups established by the code, other than  
dwelling units as previously noted. A few of the incidental uses are to be regulated only where  
located within a specific occupancy or a limited number of occupancies.  
It is common for many of the listed incidental uses to be unoccupied for extended periods of  
time, creating the potential for a fire to grow unnoticed. Oftentimes, combustible or hazardous  
materials are present in such areas. Because of the potentially high fuel load and lack of constant  
supervision, spaces such as furnace rooms, machinery rooms, laundry rooms, and waste  
collection rooms are selectively considered incidental uses. Other uses, such as paint shops,  
laboratories, and vocational shops, may cause concern to the point where they too must be  
protected or separated from other areas of the building. A significant number of incidental uses  
are located in Group I-2 occupancies and ambulatory care facilities due to the concerns related to  
occupants who are incapable of self-preservation.  
How are incidental uses regulated? The fire-resistance-rated separations required by Table  
509.1 are to be fire barriers and/or horizontal assemblies, typically having a minimum fire-  
resistance rating of 1 hour. For incinerator rooms and paint shops, the minimum required rating  
is greater. Where an automatic sprinkler system provides the necessary protection, it need only  
be installed within the incidental use under consideration. Examples of the requirements are  
illustrated in Figure 509-1.  
There is a variety of combinations regarding the separation and protection methods identified  
in Table 509.1. It should be noted that where an automatic sprinkler system is utilized without a  
fire barrier as the protective element, the incidental use must still be separated from the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationremainder of the building. However, this separation need only consist of construction capable of  
resisting the passage of smoke. As this requirement is performance in nature rather than  
prescriptive, the separation is not required to be constructed as a smoke partition or smoke  
barrier. Although not required to have a fire-resistance rating, walls must either extend to the  
underside of the floor or roof deck above, or to the underside of a fire-resistance-rated  
floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assembly. Doors are to be self-closing or automatic-closing upon  
detection of smoke, with no air-transfer openings or excessive undercuts. See Figure 509-2. The  
room must be tightly enclosed, providing for the containment of smoke while assisting in the  
heat increase necessary to activate the automatic sprinkler system.  
Table 509.1 Incidental Uses. Incidental uses are limited to those rooms or spaces listed in this  
table. The listed rooms have been selected for inclusion because of the increased hazard they  
present to the other areas of the building. However, it is recognized that the degree of hazard is  
such that a separate occupancy classification is not warranted. In fact, such a classification may  
be overly restrictive. The intent of the fire separation and fire protection requirements is to  
provide safeguards because of the increased hazard level presented by the incidental use.  
Furnace rooms and boiler rooms. The hazard potential for fuel-fired heating equipment is  
addressed once the thresholds established in the table have been exceeded. It should be noted that  
the limitations are based on individual pieces of equipment, rather than the aggregate amounts  
from all equipment within the space. For example, the requirements of Table 509.1 are not  
applicable where there are two furnaces within the furnace room, each with an input rating of  
300,000 Btu per hour \(87,900 watts\). Because no furnace exceeds the 400,000 Btu/hr \(117,200  
watts\) threshold, there is no fire barrier separation or automatic sprinkler system protection  
required.  
The regulated furnace or boiler is anticipated to be located within a room isolated from the  
remainder of the building. Where such an enclosed space is provided, the furnace room or boiler  
room must either be separated from other portions of the building with a complying fire barrier  
and/or horizontal assembly, or isolated by construction capable of resisting the passage of smoke  
and provided with an automatic sprinkler system. The intent of the requirement is to address the  
hazards associated with specified boilers and furnaces, along with those hazards created where a  
concealed accessible space with limited occupancy is provided.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 509-1 Incidental use.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 509-2 Incidental use smoke separations.  
Hydrogen fuel gas rooms. Hydrogen fuel gas rooms are defined in Chapter 2 as rooms or  
spaces that are intended exclusively to house a gaseous hydrogen system. Special requirements  
applicable to such rooms are set forth in Section 421. Where the quantities of materials would  
cause a hydrogen fuel gas room to be classified as a Group H occupancy, the separation  
requirements of Section 508.4 for separated occupancies will apply rather than those of Table  
509.1.  
The reference in the table exempting those rooms classified as Group H is not strictly limited  
to hydrogen fuel gas rooms. In fact, where the quantities of hazardous materials in any of the  
rooms or areas designated by Table 509.1 exceed those permitted by Section 307.1 causing  
classification as a Group H occupancy, the use of the table is not appropriate. In a mixed-  
occupancy building, all spaces with a Group H classification must be separated from the  
remainder of the building in accordance with Section 508.4 for separated occupancies.  
Paint shops. The provisions of Section 416 control the construction, installation, and use of  
rooms for spraying paints, varnishes, or other flammable materials used for painting, varnishing,  
staining, or similar purposes. The paint shops regulated by Table 509.1 are those rooms where  
the same types of spraying operations occur. As a general rule, a minimum 1-hour fire-resistive  
enclosure is mandated by Section 416.2 to isolate spray rooms from the remainder of the  
building. However, in all but Group F occupancies, Table 509.1 mandates a higher degree of  
protection.  
Laboratories and vocational shops. In educational buildings, particularly secondary schools, it  
is common to find multiple laboratories and vocational shops that are an extension of the  
educational function. Because of the presence of some quantities of hazardous materials in such  
laboratories, as well as in those labs associated with Group I-2 occupancies, the code mandates  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsome degree of separation and/or protection. Where the quantities of hazardous materials warrant  
a Group H classification, the use of this table is inappropriate. Vocational shops in schools also  
pose a hazard to the remainder of the building that is due to the hazardous processes and  
combustible materials involved. Where no such hazards exist, such as in a computer lab or  
design lab, the table is not intended to apply.  
Section 510 Special Provisions  
The provisions of this section allow for modifications or exceptions to the general provisions for  
building heights and areas as regulated by Chapter 5 of the IBC. These special provisions are  
viewed as specific in nature and, based on Section 102.1, take precedence over any general  
provisions that may apply. Because this section permits, rather than requires, the use of the  
special conditions established in Section 510, the provisions are optional. Much like the  
application of the mezzanine provisions of Section 505, only where the designer elects to utilize  
the special allowances does this section apply.  
It is evident that several of the provisions overlap in their scope. For example, Sections 510.2,  
510.4, and 510.7 all address a potential condition where an open parking garage is located below  
a Group R occupancy. It is the choice of the designer which of the three methods to use where  
such a condition exists, based on the benefits and consequences of each method. Or, as stated  
above, none of the methods need to be applied. The requirements could simply be based on the  
general provisions of Chapter 5 for allowable building height and area.  
510.2 Horizontal building separation allowance. This section is one of several that contain  
provisions that might be considered the only exceptions to the principle that a fire wall is the  
only code-established approach to dividing a single building into two or more separate buildings.  
See the discussion of Section 503.1 for the application the fire wall concept. In Item 1, the code  
makes provisions for the use of a minimum 3-hour fire-resistance-rated horizontal assembly,  
including any horizontal offsets that are provided, as an equivalent construction feature, in  
certain aspects, to a fire wall. This methodology is often referred to as “podium” or “pedestal”  
buildings.  
The provisions create, in effect, an exception that allows those stories below the horizontal  
fire separation to be considered portions of a separate building for specific purposes, provided no  
Group H occupancy is involved. The stories above the horizontal separation must only house  
Group B, M, R, and/or S occupancies, as well as Group A occupancies having less than 300  
occupants. As these occupancies are quite common in Type III and V construction, the typical  
application is to grant the maximum number of stories for Type III or V construction without the  
penalty of sacrificing one or more stories for a parking garage or other permitted uses located on  
the level\(s\) below the 3-hour horizontal assembly. Distinct buildings are also created for area  
limitations and fire wall continuity.  
It is fairly common in terrain that has a rolling or hillside character to erect apartment houses  
and small office/retail buildings with a garage below. Because of the slope of the ground surface,  
the lowest level is usually partially within the ground; therefore, the walls are normally designed  
as reinforced concrete or reinforced masonry-retaining walls. The construction of the lowest  
level is thereby easily able to conform to the code construction requirements for a Type IA  
building.  
If the lower levels are classified as stories above grade plane, they would typically be  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationincluded in the number of total stories permitted by the code. However, as depicted in Figure  
510-1, those stories would not be included where the building below the 3-hour horizontal  
separation is of Type IA construction.  
The code lists six conditions that must be met in order to take advantage of these provisions.  
The first condition regulates the fire-resistance rating of the horizontal assembly. Second, the  
minimum type of construction for portions below the horizontal assembly is established. The  
third condition addresses the methods for protection of openings that will occur in the fire-  
resistance-rated horizontal assembly. An allowance for combustible stairways in the Type IA  
building is established in Condition 4 as shown in Figure 510-2. Fifth, only Group A  
occupancies having an occupant load of less than 300, and Groups B, M, R, and S are permitted  
to be located above the horizontal assembly. The sixth condition limits the use of the building  
below the horizontal assembly to those that are not classified as Group H and requires the lower  
building to be sprinklered throughout. An often-overlooked provision is the seventh condition,  
requiring that the overall height in feet \(mm\) of both buildings not exceed the height limits set  
forth in Section 504.3 for the least type of construction that occurs in the building.  
Of critical importance is the scope of the horizontal separation’s use as an alternative to the  
general requirements of Chapter 5. The buildings that are created above and below the separation  
are only to be considered as separate and distinct buildings for four purposes\:  
Figure 510-2 Stairway construction.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 510-1 Horizontal building separation.  
• Allowable area limitations  
• Continuity of fire walls  
• Allowable number of stories limitation  
• Type of construction determination  
For all other applications of the IBC, the entire structure both above and below the horizontal  
separation is to be considered as a single building.  
510.3 Group S-2 enclosed parking garage with Group S-2 open parking garage above. The  
provisions of this section are similar in nature to those of Section 510.2, insofar as the two  
different parking uses in a single structure, one located above the other, may be considered two  
separate and distinct buildings for the purpose of determining the type of construction. Five  
specific conditions must be met in order for an open parking garage, located above an enclosed  
parking garage, to be regulated on its own for construction type. Details of this special situation  
are shown in Figure 510-3.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 510-3 Open and enclosed parking structure.  
Figure 510-4 Parking beneath Group R occupancy.  
510.4 Parking beneath Group R. Consistent with the concepts expressed by Sections 510.2 and  
510.3, the provisions of this section address residential uses located above a first story used as a  
parking garage. Where parking is limited to the first story, the number of stories used in the  
determination of the minimum type of construction may be measured from the floor above the  
garage. The construction type of the parking garage and the floor assembly between the  
residential area and the garage are further regulated. See Figure 510-4.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation510.7 Open parking garage beneath Groups A, I, B, M, and R. The excellent fire-safety  
record for open parking garages is the basis for this modification in the general provisions for  
allowable floor area and allowable height. Where located below assembly, institutional, business,  
mercantile, or residential occupancies, an open parking garage is regulated for height and area by  
Section 406.5. Those permitted occupancies located above the parking garage are independently  
regulated by Section 503.1 for height and area. The only exception requires that the height of the  
portion of the building above the open parking garage, both in feet \(mm\) and stories, be  
measured from the grade plane.  
The details of construction type are applicable to each of the occupancies involved; however,  
the structural-frame members shall be of fire-resistance-rated construction according to the most  
restrictive fire-resistive assemblies of the occupancy groups involved. Egress from the areas  
above the parking garage shall be isolated from the garage, with the level of protection at least 2  
hours.  
Because the provisions of Section 510.2 can also address open parking garages below similar  
occupancies, the application of this section may be limited. There are several minor differences  
between the two provisions; however, the general concept remains consistent.  
510.8 Group B or M buildings with Group S-2 open parking garage above. A desirable  
feature in high-density areas is to have offices and/or retail stores on the lower levels of open  
parking structures. This provision allows for the type of construction for the portion of the  
structure below the parking garage to be evaluated separately from that of the open parking  
garage above, provided the uses are properly separated and the means of egress from the garage  
is independent from that of the first floor \(and basement if applicable\). This provision reverses  
the conditions addressed by other provisions of Section 510 where the parking garage is located  
below other occupancies. The resulting benefit provides for a potential reduction in the type of  
construction by permitting the evaluation of allowable floor areas independently for the open  
parking garage and the Group B and/or M occupancies.  
510.9 Multiple buildings above a horizontal assembly. Where the varying provisions of  
Section 510 are utilized to create separate buildings above and below a complying horizontal  
separation, it is acceptable for two or more buildings to be located above the separation while  
only one building \(a parking garage\) is located below. For example, a condominium building is  
permitted to be regulated as a separate building from an adjacent office building even though  
both are located above a single parking facility designed under the special provisions of Sections  
510.2, 510.3, or 510.8, as applicable. An example is shown in Figure 510-5.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 510-5 Separate buildings above horizontal separation.  
KEY POINTS  
• Buildings are regulated for maximum size based upon the occupancy or occupancies  
involved, the building’s construction type, and special features such as sprinkler  
protection and open frontage.  
• Table 506.2 provides the allowable area factor per story for all occupancies and types of  
construction.  
• The maximum height of a building above grade plane is regulated by Tables 504.3 and  
504.4 for the total height in feet and the maximum height in stories above grade plane,  
respectively.  
• Buildings of three or more stories in height are permitted to be three times the allowable  
area permitted for a single story.  
• Stepped or terraced buildings should be reviewed carefully to determine the height, as  
often each segment can be viewed independently of the others.  
• Mezzanines are defined by the code in a very specific manner.  
• The area of the basement typically does not need to be included in the total allowable  
area of the building.  
• The installation of automatic sprinkler systems throughout a building typically provides  
for a sizable increase in the allowable area and building height.  
• Sufficient open yards and public ways may be used to increase the allowable area.  
• Through the use of adequate safeguards, the IBC allows certain types of buildings and  
occupancies to have unlimited floor areas.  
• In mixed-occupancy buildings, three different methods \(accessory occupancies,  
nonseparated occupancies, and separated occupancies\) are available for addressing  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationoccupancy classification, allowable height and area, and separation.  
• Incidental uses, classified as a part of the building where the use is located, shall be  
separated, protected, or both.

# TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION  
Section 602 Construction Classification  
Section 603 Combustible Material in Type I and II Construction  
Key Points  
As its title implies, this chapter develops requirements for the classification of buildings by  
type of construction. Based on a combination of two general factors, the combustibility  
potential of the materials of construction and the degree of fire-resistance protecting such  
materials, there are 12 unique construction types. The use of combustible materials in  
otherwise noncombustible buildings is also addressed  
Section 602 Construction Classification  
For the most part, the concepts and applications related to type of construction are focused on  
one simple mandate\: In order to build a structure bigger, it must be built better. Where a building  
is required to be greater in height and floor area, the materials of construction and fire-resistive  
protection of building elements are regulated in a manner that addresses the increased hazards  
that are inherent in larger structures. The type of construction provisions of Chapter 6 are directly  
related to the allowable height and area provisions of Chapter 5.  
Since early in the last century, the fire protection required for the various types of  
construction has been based on hourly fire-endurance ratings. Prior to this time, fire-resistance  
requirements were developed by specifying the type and thickness of materials used.  
Many of the concepts in previous building codes that have carried over to today were  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdeveloped from the reports issued by the committee known as the Department of Commerce  
Building Code Committee, which was appointed by Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of  
Commerce. The committee was also dubbed the Little Hoover Commission and was appointed to  
investigate building codes. This was an outgrowth of the findings of the Senate Committee on  
Reconstruction and Production, which was appointed in 1920 to study the various factors  
entering into the recovery of our economy from the depression of the early 1920s. Although the  
committee studied a wide-ranging set of those institutions and groups affected by the economy, it  
was especially interested in construction. During its tenure, the committee held numerous  
hearings and expressed the following sentiment at their conclusion\: “The building codes of this  
country have not been developed on scientific data, but rather on compromise; they are not  
uniform in practice and in many instances involve an additional cost of construction without  
assuring more useful or more durable buildings.  
” Thus, the stage was set for improvement in  
building regulations, and the timing was especially favorable for the model codes to take  
advantage of the reports of the Department of Commerce Building Code Committee.  
The IBC® classifies construction into five basic categories, listed in a somewhat descending  
order from the most fire resistant to the least fire resistant. These five types are based on two  
main groupings, noncombustible \(required\) construction \(Types I and II\) and combustible  
\(permitted\) construction \(Types III, IV, and V\). The various types of construction within the five  
categories are further subdivided based on fire protection and are represented as follows\:  
1\. Noncombustible, protected—Types IA, IB, and IIA  
2\. Noncombustible, unprotected—Type IIB  
3\. Combustible and/or noncombustible, protected—Types IIIA, IV-A, IV-B, IV-C, IV-HT,  
and VA  
4\. Combustible and/or noncombustible, unprotected—Types IIIB and VB  
Although Types III, IV, and V are commonly considered combustible construction, the use of  
noncombustible materials, either in part or throughout the building, is certainly acceptable. The  
reference to combustible construction more simply indicates that such construction is acceptable  
in Types III, IV, and V but not mandated. A perusal of Tables 504.3, 504.4, and 506.2 indicates  
that the IBC considers Type II, III, and IV-HT buildings to be of comparable protection. For  
example, Types IIA, IV-HT, and, to some degree, IIIA are permitted the same approximate areas  
and heights for most occupancy classifications. The same is also true for Types IIB and IIIB.  
Type IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C mass timber construction height and area limits have been derived  
from a variety of factors.  
Differing from the concept of mixed-occupancy buildings, the code does not permit a building  
to be considered to have more than one type of construction. In simple terms, classification of a  
building for construction type is based on the weakest link concept. If a building does not fully  
conform to the provisions of Chapter 6 for type of construction classification, it must be  
classified into a lower type into which it does conform. Unless specifically permitted elsewhere  
by the code, the presence of any combustible elements regulated by Table 601 prohibits its  
classification as Type I or II construction. Similarly, the lack of required fire resistance in any  
element required by Table 601 to be protected will result in a fully nonrated building.  
Table 601 identifies the required fire-resistance ratings of building elements based on the  
specified type of construction. Reference is made to Section 703.2 for those building elements  
required to have a fire-resistance rating by Table 601. Section 703.2 establishes the appropriate  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationtest procedures for building elements, components, and assemblies that are required to have a  
fire-resistance rating.  
The provisions of Chapter 6 in regard to fire resistance are intended to address the structural  
integrity of the building elements under fire conditions. Unlike those fire-resistance-rated  
assemblies, such as fire walls and fire barriers, whose intent is to safeguard against the spread of  
fire, the protection afforded by the provisions of Chapter 6 is solely that of structural integrity.  
As such, the protection of door and window openings, ducts, and air transfer openings is not  
required for building elements required to be fire-resistance rated by Table 601 unless mandated  
by other provisions of the IBC.  
The IBC intends that the provisions of the code are minimum standards. Thus, Section  
602.1.1 directs that buildings not be required to conform to the requirements for a type of  
construction higher than the type that meets the minimum requirements of the IBC based on  
occupancy. A fairly common case in this regard is where a developer may construct an industrial  
building that complies in most respects to the requirements of the code for a Type IIIB building,  
but the occupancy provisions are such that a Type VB building would meet the requirements of  
the code. In this latter case, it would be clearly inappropriate and, in fact, a violation of the code  
for the building official to require full compliance with requirements for a Type IIIB building.  
However, where the building does comply in all respects to Type IIIB, the building official may  
so classify it.  
602.2 Types I and II. Buildings classified as Type I and II are to be constructed of  
noncombustible materials unless otherwise modified by the code. The various building elements  
in these noncombustible buildings are regulated by Table 601. Although Type I and II buildings  
are defined as noncombustible, it is evidenced by Section 603 that combustible materials are  
permitted in limited quantities. Wood doors and frames, trim, and wall finish are permitted, as  
well as combustible flooring, insulation, and roofing materials. Where these combustibles are  
properly controlled, they have proven, over the years, to not add significantly to the fire hazard.  
Furthermore, Type I buildings are to be of the highest levels of fire-resistance-rated  
construction. The fire-resistance ratings required for Type I buildings historically have provided  
about the same protection over the years and, thus, have proved to be satisfactory for  
occupancies housed in buildings of considerable height and area, particularly those designated as  
high-rise buildings. Type IB construction is very similar to Type IA construction except for a  
reduction of 1 hour in the required ratings for interior and exterior bearing walls, and the  
structural frame, while providing a ½-hour reduction for roof construction. Thus, and particularly  
because of the reduction in the fire-resistance rating required for the structural frame, the Type  
IB building does not enjoy all of the unlimited height and areas that accrue to the Type IA  
building. It will be noted from Tables 504.3, 504.4, and 506.2 that Type IB construction typically  
has height and, to some degree, area limits placed on it.  
Buildings of Type II construction, although noncombustible, may be of either protected \(Type  
IIA\) or unprotected \(Type IIB\) construction. The building elements of a Type IIA building are  
typically required to be protected to a minimum fire-resistance rating of 1 hour. Such elements in  
a Type IIB structure may be nonrated.  
602.3 Type III. The Type III building grew out of the necessity to prevent conflagrations in  
heavily built-up areas where buildings were erected side by side in congested downtown  
business districts. After the severe conflagrations of years past in Chicago and Baltimore, it  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbecame apparent that some control must be made to prevent the spread of fire from one building  
to another. As a result, the Type III building was defined. The Type III building is, in essence, a  
wood-frame building \(Type V\) with fire-resistance-rated noncombustible exterior walls.  
Around the turn of the 20th century, and prior to the promulgation of modern building codes,  
Type III buildings were known as ordinary construction. They later became known in some  
circles as ordinary masonry construction. However, as stated previously, the intent behind the  
creation of this type of construction was to prevent the spread of fire from one combustible  
building to another. Thus, the early requirements for these buildings were for a certain thickness  
of masonry walls, such as 13 inches \(330 mm\) of brick for one-story and 17 inches \(432 mm\) for  
two-story buildings of bearing-wall construction. Later, the required fire endurance was specified  
in hours. Thus, any approved noncombustible construction that would successfully pass the  
standard fire test for the prescribed number of hours was permitted.  
In spite of the requirement for noncombustible exterior walls, Type III buildings are  
considered combustible structures and are either protected \(Type IIIA\) or unprotected \(Type  
IIIB\). Interior building elements are permitted to be either combustible or noncombustible. There  
is an allowance for the use of fire-retardant-treated wood as a portion of the exterior wall  
assembly, provided such wall assemblies have a required fire-resistance rating of 2 hours or less.  
602.4 Type IV. Type IV construction is represented by two distinctly different approaches to the  
use of large wood building elements. A single term, mass timber, represents the various sawn  
and engineered wood products that make up this unique construction type. Traditional Type IV-  
HT construction has exterior walls made of noncombustible materials, fire-retardant-treated  
wood \(FRTW\), or protected cross-laminated timber \(CLT\). Interior building elements must be of  
solid or laminated wood. Columns and roof/floor beams and girders must have minimum  
nominal dimensions per Table 2304.11. Flooring, roof decking, and partitions must be of a  
minimum thickness as prescribed in the IBC. Type IV-HT is deemed to meet fire-resistance  
requirements based on its required minimum dimensions.  
In contrast, mass timber used in construction types IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C is required to have a  
fire-resistance rating. The rating is to be determined in accordance with IBC Section 703.2,  
which includes calculations in accordance with IBC Section 722. The fire-resistance rating is  
determined by adding the fire resistance of the unprotected wood element to the protection time  
provided by the noncombustible protection.  
Type IV-HT construction. Although Type IV-HT buildings have traditionally been designated  
as heavy-timber buildings, they may also have interior building elements of solid wood,  
laminated wood, or structural composite lumber \(SCL\). In the eastern United States during the  
1800s, a type of construction evolved that was known as mill construction. Mill construction was  
developed by insurance companies to reduce the significant losses they were facing in the heavy  
industrialized areas of the Northeast.  
Type IV-HT construction has historically been recognized for its slow burning characteristics.  
Wood under the action of fire loses its surface moisture, and when the surface temperature  
reaches about 400°F \(204°C\), flaming and charring begin. Under a continued application of the  
heat, charring continues, but at an increasingly slower rate, as the charred wood insulates the  
inner portion of the wood member. There is quite often enough sound wood remaining during  
and after a fire to prevent sudden structural collapse. In recognition of these characteristics, the  
insurance interests reasoned that replacement of light-wood framing on the interior of factory  
buildings with heavy-timber construction would substantially decrease their fire losses.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIn the early development of Type IV-HT heavy-timber construction, not only did the heavy-  
timber members have large cross sections to achieve the slow-burning characteristic, but,  
furthermore, surfaces were required to be smooth and flat. Sharp projections were to be avoided,  
as well as concealed and inaccessible spaces. Thus, the intent of the concept was to provide open  
structural framing without concealed spaces and without sharp projections or rough surfaces,  
which are more easily ignitable. In this case, flame spread along the surface of heavy-timber  
members is reduced, and without concealed blind spaces, there is no opportunity for fire to  
smolder and spread undetected. Current allowances for concealed spaces now recognize that  
such spaces are necessary to accommodate mechanicals. Therefore, concealment is acceptable  
where the contents are limited to noncombustible materials other than building elements and  
compliant electrical, mechanical, fire protection, and plumbing materials. In addition, all  
concealed spaces must be protected by one of the methods set forth in Section 602.4.4.3.  
In accordance with Table 601 and Section 2304.11, current Type IV-HT construction can be a  
mixture of heavy-timber floor and roof construction and 1-hour fire-resistance-rated bearing  
walls and partitions. Although Type IV-HT construction is not generally recognized as  
equivalent to 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction, the code considers heavy timber to  
provide equivalent protection.  
In keeping with the concept of slow-burning construction by means of wood members with  
large cross sections, the IBC specifies minimum nominal dimensions for wood members used in  
Type IV-HT construction. As the code specifies the size of members as nominal sizes, the actual  
net surfaced sizes may be used. For example, an 8-inch by 8-inch \(203-mm by 203-mm\) solid  
sawn member nominally will actually be a net size of 7¼ inches by 7¼ inches \(185 mm by 185  
mm\). Therefore, even though the code calls for a nominal 8-inch by 8-inch \(203-mm by 203-  
mm\) member, the net 7¼-inch by 7¼-inch \(185-mm by 185-mm\) member meets the intent of the  
code. As indicated earlier, the minimum sizes for heavy-timber construction are based on  
experience and the good behavior in fire of Type IV-HT construction.  
Wherever framing lumber or sawn timber is specified, structural glued-laminated timber or  
SCL may also be used, as all have the same inherent fire-resistive capability. However, because  
solid sawn wood members, glued-laminated timbers, and SCL are manufactured with different  
methods and procedures, they do not have the same dimensions. Table 2304.11 compares the  
solid sawn sizes with those of glued-laminated members and SCL to indicate equivalency in  
regard to compliance with the Type IV-HT construction criteria.  
Section 2304.11.2.2 specifies that partitions shall be of either solid-wood construction or 1-  
hour fire-resistance-rated construction. However, various provisions of the code address the use  
of fire partitions and fire barriers. In these cases, the fire-resistant-rated fire partitions or fire  
barriers in Type IV-HT buildings should be constructed as required by the code for the required  
rating. For example, where there is a requirement for fire-resistance-rated corridors, 1-hour fire-  
resistance-rated construction must be used rather than solid-wood construction for the fire  
partitions.  
It is highly unusual for any building designed and constructed today to be considered  
compliant as a Type IV-HT structure. As previously addressed, in order for a building to be  
properly classified, all portions must be in conformance with the established criteria. Many  
buildings may have some heavy-timber elements that qualify for use in Type IV-HT buildings;  
however, the floor construction does not fully comply with the prescriptive requirements of  
Sections 2304.11.3. In such cases, the building cannot be classified as Type IV-HT. Such  
buildings are most likely Type III or V construction. However, even if the building as a whole is  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationnot considered a Type IV-HT structure, the recognition of individual heavy-timber elements is  
very important. For example, the provisions of Section 705.2.3 recognize heavy-timber  
projections for use in locations where unprotected combustible construction is not permitted. For  
this and other reasons, the requirements for Type IV-HT buildings and heavy timber construction  
must be fully understood.  
Types IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C construction. The recent introduction of cross-laminated timber  
\(CLT\) in U.S. construction to form solid timber wall, floor, and roof sections has brought about a  
sea of change in the structural and fire-resistance performance for wood buildings. This  
necessitated development of three entirely new construction types \(IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C\) with  
their own unique material and fire-resistance requirements, and corresponding building size  
limitations.  
The Type IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C construction types are indicative of just how different the  
structural and fire performance of solid timber walls, floors, and roofs is compared to repetitive-  
member frame buildings using studs and joists. Fire resistance of solid timber assemblies is very  
different from assemblies with concealed spaces, and when solid mass timber is protected by  
gypsum the difference can be dramatic. By way of example, a five-ply CLT wall with one layer  
of 5/8-inch \(15.9-mm\) Type X gypsum has achieved 3-hour fire resistance in an ASTM E119  
test, whereas a wood stud wall with the same amount of gypsum achieves only a 1-hour fire-  
resistance rating. The structural performance of CLT walls and floors is also vastly different than  
their light-frame counterparts.  
The greatest challenge in the recognition of Type IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C construction involved  
developing an approach to compensate for the combustible nature of the material while  
recognizing its inherent fire resistance and fire performance. The initial step was the  
development of a protection system that would result in a performance akin to that of existing  
Type IB construction, then assigning similar fire-resistance requirements to Type IV-B  
buildings. The same process was used to address Type IV-A and IV-C buildings in turn.  
It was determined that fire testing was necessary to validate the established performance  
objectives. Consequently, five full-scale, multiple-story fire tests were developed to simulate the  
three construction types \(Type IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C\). The successful results of those tests, as  
well as testing for structural performance in accordance with ASTM E119, and additional testing  
by others, helped establish the basis of the mass timber code provisions.  
Performance of all mass timber structural elements, whether protected or exposed, is based on  
design for a quantified fire resistance \(e.g., 2 or 3 hours\) consistent with traditional construction  
types that have performed well for buildings of similar sizes. In the end, the concepts of adding  
the fire-resistance contribution of noncombustible protection to the fire resistance of the exposed  
mass timber element and specifying the relative portion of fire resistance that must be provided  
by the noncombustible protection, were developed specifically for the Type IV-A, Type IV-B,  
and Type IV-C mass timber construction types.  
Because of the close relationship to traditional heavy timber, the established variants are Type  
IV-A for buildings with structural elements completely protected with noncombustible  
protection, Type IV-B for buildings with structural elements mostly protected with  
noncombustible protection, and Type IV-C for buildings with most structural elements left  
unprotected. Even in Type IV-C, noncombustible protection is required for concealed spaces,  
shaft walls, and the exterior surface of outside walls \(see Table 6-1\).  
For Type IV-B construction, the amount of exposed surface permitted, as well as the required  
separation between unprotected portions, is intended to limit potential contribution of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstructure to an interior fire \(see Figure 602-1\). The intent of the 15-foot separation distance is to  
prevent large sections of walls or ceilings from providing enough radiant energy between them to  
continue burning. Unprotected portions of mass timber ceilings, including attached beams, are  
limited to an area equal to not more than 20 percent of the base floor area in any dwelling unit or  
fire area. Unprotected portions of mass timber walls, including attached columns, are limited to  
an area of not more than 40 percent of the base floor area. Unprotected portions of both walls  
and ceilings of mass timber, including attached columns and beams, are limited in area in  
accordance with an equation for summing two ratios of actual exposed area to allowable exposed  
area. Columns and beams that are not an integral part of a wall or ceiling, such as columns  
located in the middle of a space or room, are not required to be included in the calculation of  
ceiling and wall areas, respectively, and are permitted to be unprotected without restriction as to  
unprotected area or separation from one another.  
Table 6-1. Type IV-A, IV-B and IV-C Construction Comparison  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 602-1  
Combustible light-frame materials are specifically and completely excluded from these three  
new types of construction. Light-frame wood stud or joist assemblies are prohibited, including  
the use of light-frame wood to fur out concealed spaces. To accommodate mechanicals in Type  
IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C construction, protected concealed spaces are permitted where protected  
with noncombustible materials or provided with sprinkler coverage.  
Interior exit enclosures and elevator hoistway enclosures in high-rise buildings up to and  
including 12 stories or 180 feet \(54,864 mm\) are permitted to be constructed of mass timber  
having noncombustible protection. For buildings above 12 stories or 180 feet \(54,864 mm\),  
interior exit and elevator hoistway enclosures must be constructed of noncombustible materials  
for their entire building height. Other shafts in buildings above 12 stories or 180 feet \(54,864  
mm\), like those used for mechanical equipment, are permitted to be constructed of mass timber  
having noncombustible protection \(see Table 6-1\).  
602.5 Type V. Type V buildings are essentially construction systems that will not fit into any of  
the other higher types of construction and may be constructed of any materials permitted by the  
code. The usual example of Type V construction is the light wood-frame building consisting of  
walls and partitions of 2-inch by 4-inch \(51-mm by 102-mm\) or 2-inch by 6-inch \(51-mm by  
152-mm\) wood studs. The floor and ceiling framing are usually of light wood joists of 2-inch by  
6-inch \(51-mm by 152-mm\) size or deeper. Roofs may also be framed with light wood rafters of  
2-inch by 4-inch \(51-mm by 102-mm\) size or deeper cross sections or, as is now quite prevalent,  
framed with pre-engineered wood trusses of light-frame construction. Wood-frame Type V  
buildings may be constructed with larger framing members than just described, and these  
members may actually conform to heavy-timber sizes. Such structures sometimes have a  
significant number of noncombustible building elements. However, unless the building complies  
in all respects to one of the other four basic types of construction, it is still a Type V building.  
Type V construction is divided into two subtypes\:  
1\. Type VA. This is protected construction and required to be of 1-hour fire-resistance-rated  
construction throughout.  
2\. Type VB. This type of construction has no general requirements for fire resistance and  
may be of unprotected construction, except where Section 705.5 requires exterior wall  
protection because of proximity to a lot line.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTable 601—Fire-Resistance Rating Requirements for Building Elements. This table provides  
the basic fire-resistance rating requirements for the various types of construction. It also  
delineates those fire-resistance ratings required to qualify for a particular type of construction. As  
previously discussed, even though a building may have some features that conform to a higher  
type of construction, the building shall not be required to conform to that higher type of  
construction as long as a lower type will meet the minimum requirements of the code based on  
occupancy. Nevertheless, any building must comply with all the basic fire-resistance  
requirements in this table if it is indeed the intent to classify it for that particular type of  
construction. The 12 designations used throughout the code to describe a specific construction  
type are not specifically defined in the IBC. Rather, their definitions can only be determined  
through the combination of the provisions of Section 602.2, 602.3, 602.4, or 602.5 along with  
those set forth in Table 601. For example, the definition of a building identified as being of Type  
IIA construction is based on Section 602.2 requiring the building to have noncombustible  
building elements, as well as Table 601 mandating that the primary structural frame, bearing  
walls, floor construction, and roof construction, as applicable, be provided with minimum 1-hour  
fire-resistive ratings. It is only through the evaluation of these two provisions that the definition  
of a Type IIA building can be realized.  
Footnote a. Limited in application to buildings of Type I and Type IV construction, the fire-  
resistance ratings of primary structural frame elements and interior bearing walls supporting only  
a roof may be reduced by 1 hour. In other words, primary structural-frame members or interior  
bearing walls providing only roof support shall have a minimum fire-resistance rating of 2 hours  
in Type IA buildings and 1 hour in Type IB construction. The 1-hour reduction is also permitted  
for roof supports in Type IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C construction, but it is not permitted for interior  
bearing walls. Additional provisions addressing the protection of certain primary structural frame  
members are found in Section 704.  
Footnote b. This footnote, an exception to the general rule for roof construction, addresses  
those situations where the roof and its components are 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) or more above any  
floor immediately below. Under these circumstances, the roof and its components, including  
primary structural frame roof members, roof framing, and decking, may be of unprotected  
construction. The reduction of the fire-resistance rating would apply to buildings of Type IA, IB,  
IIA, IIIA, and VA construction. The footnote mandates that all portions of the roof construction  
must be located at or above the 20-foot \(6,096-mm\) height requirement. For example, in a sloped  
roof condition, it is not acceptable to merely protect those portions below the 20-foot \(6,096-  
mm\) point and leave the remainder unprotected. See Figure 601-1. It is important to note that the  
elimination of any required fire-resistance rating is also applicable to elements of the roof  
construction considered as primary structural frame members.  
The reduction in rating applies to all occupancies other than Groups F-1, H, M, and S-1,  
where fire loading is typically higher. In all occupancies other than those just listed, the  
relaxation of the requirements is based on the fact that where the roof is at least 20 feet \(6,096  
mm\) above the nearest floor, the temperatures at this elevation during most fire incidents are  
quite low. As a result, fire protection of the roof and its members, including the structural frame,  
is not necessary. For those occupancies where the fire loading and the consequent potential fire  
severity is relatively high, such as factory-industrial, hazardous, mercantile, or storage uses, the  
code does not permit a reduction in roof protection. It is also quite common in these occupancies  
for combustible or hazardous materials to be located in close proximity to the roof structure, as  
in the case of high-piled storage.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 601-1 Fire-resistive ratings for roof construction.  
Footnote c. Applicable to Types IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, and VA construction, the code permits  
heavy-timber members complying with Section 2304.11 to be used in the roof construction  
without any fire-resistance rating as required by the table. It is assumed that roof members sized  
and constructed in compliance with the details of heavy-timber construction are equivalent to  
roof construction having a 1-hour fire-resistance rating. In addition, heavy-timber members are  
permitted to be utilized in the roof construction of an otherwise noncombustible Type IB, IIA, or  
IIB building. The allowance also includes the use of heavy timber primary structural frame  
members as a part of the roof construction.  
Footnote e. In addition to any required fire-resistance rating based on the type of construction  
of the building per Table 601, it is also necessary that such rating requirements for exterior walls,  
both bearing and nonbearing, be in compliance with Table 705.5. The table regulates the hourly  
fire-resistance ratings for exterior walls based on fire separation distance. This footnote  
specifically indicates that exterior bearing walls have a fire-resistance rating based on Table 601  
or 705.5, whichever provides for the highest hourly rating. Exterior nonbearing walls are totally  
regulated by the rating requirements found in Table 705.5. The provisions of Section 704.10  
must also be consulted where load-bearing structural members are located within the exterior  
walls or on the outside of the building. See Application Example 705-1 for the appropriate use of  
these provisions. In addition, applicable provisions in Section 603 regulating combustible  
material in Type I and Type II construction may apply to exterior walls.  
Footnote g. Applicable only to Type IV-HT buildings, heavy timber interior bearing walls  
supporting more than two floors or a floor and a roof are required to have a minimum 1-hour  
fire-resistance rating, which is appropriate for vertical elements in mid-rise, multistory buildings.  
If the designer desires to have an exposed CLT interior bearing wall supporting multiple stories,  
wall thickness may need to be increased to provide a minimum 1-hour rating. The rating may be  
calculated in accordance with Chapter 16 of the National Design Specification for Wood  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationConstruction as allowed in IBC Section 722.1, or a tested wall element can be utilized.  
Section 603 Combustible Material in Type I and II  
# Construction  
Buildings of Type I and II construction are considered noncombustible structures. As such, all of  
the building elements, including walls, floors, and roofs, are to be constructed of noncombustible  
materials. There are, however, a variety of exceptions to the general rule that allow a limited  
amount of combustibles to be used in the building’s construction. It has been determined that the  
level of combustibles permitted by Section 603.1, as well as their control, does not adversely  
impact the fire-severity potential caused by the materials of construction.  
The following listing provides an overview of some of those combustible materials permitted  
in Type I and II buildings\:  
1\. For other than shaft construction in Group I-2 occupancies and ambulatory care facilities,  
fire-retardant-treated \(FRT\) wood may be used in the construction of interior nonbearing  
partitions where the required fire-resistance rating of the partitions does not exceed 2  
hours. In nonbearing exterior walls, FRT wood is permitted provided no fire rating of the  
exterior walls is mandated. Roofs constructed of FRT wood are also acceptable in most  
buildings. This would include roof girders, trusses, beams, joists, or decking, as well as  
blocking, nailers, or similar components that may be a part of the roof system. Wood  
nailers of other than FRT wood may be used for parapet flashing and roof cants per Item  
27\. Where the building is classified as other than Type IA construction, the use of FRT  
wood roof elements is permitted in all cases, regardless of building height. The same  
allowance is permitted in one- and two-story buildings of Type IA construction. For Type  
IA buildings exceeding two stories in height, the use of FRT wood in the roof  
construction is only allowed if the uppermost story has a height of at least 20 feet \(6,096  
mm\). Logically, the 20-foot measurement would be taken in a manner consistent with that  
described in Footnote b of Table 601, from the floor to the lowest point of the roof  
construction above.  
The allowances provided in Section 603.1, Item 1.3, do not reduce any required level  
of fire resistance mandated for wall or roof construction as established by Table 601.  
Rather, they simply allow the use of FRT wood in the locations listed where  
noncombustible construction is otherwise required. In reviewing the permitted use of FRT  
wood, there are two obvious building elements where such materials are not permitted in  
Type I or II construction. In Type I or II buildings, FRT wood is not permitted to be used  
in the floor construction and any bearing wall assemblies.  
Per Item 13, the use of fire-retardant-treated wood is also permitted in the construction  
of balconies, porches, decks, and exterior stairways in Type I and II buildings. However,  
there are two significant conditions for such an allowance. One, the height of the building  
under consideration cannot be more than three stories above grade plane. And two, the  
balcony, porch, deck, or exterior stairway must not be considered as a required exit from  
the building.  
2\. Combustible insulation used for thermal or acoustical purposes is acceptable, provided the  
flame-spread index is limited. Additional regulations addressing the use of thermal- and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsound-insulating materials within buildings are found in Section 720.  
3\. Foam plastics installed under the limitations of Chapter 26 are permitted, as are roof  
coverings having an A, B, or C classification as specified in Section 1505.  
4\. Wood doors, door frames, window sashes and frames, trim, and other combustible  
millwork and interior surface finishes are acceptable, as is blocking for handrails, grab  
bars, cabinets, window and door frames, wall-mounted fixtures, and similar items.  
Combustible stages and platforms are also permitted when complying with Section 410,  
and wood-finish flooring may be used when applied directly to the floor slab or installed  
over wood sleepers and fireblocked in accordance with Section 805.1.  
Another allowable use of combustible elements in noncombustible buildings, detailed in Item  
11, addresses the situation where nonbearing partitions divide portions of stores, offices, or  
similar spaces occupied by one tenant only. The key words in this item are “occupied by one  
tenant only.  
” It is the intent of the IBC that this expression applies to an area or building that is  
under the complete control of one person, organization, or other occupant. This would be  
contrasted to multitenant occupancies, where the various tenant spaces in the building would be  
under the control of two or more individuals, companies, or occupants. In such a multitenant  
space, the walls common to the public areas and to other tenants would not be regulated under  
this allowance. However, within each of the tenant spaces, those nonbearing walls and partitions  
not common with other tenants or public areas could utilize the optional construction methods of  
Item 11.  
Reference is also made under Item 24 to Section 718.5 for the allowance of specific  
combustible elements within concealed spaces. The allowance for combustible items in  
concealed spaces is limited because of the increased potential for fire spread. Therefore, the  
flame spread index and smoke-developed index of the permitted items are often highly regulated.  
Combustible piping is permitted to be installed within partitions, shaft enclosures, and concealed  
ceiling spaces of noncombustible buildings. Various combustible materials are also permitted in  
plenums of Type I and II buildings, including wiring, fire-sprinkler piping, pneumatic tubing,  
and foam plastic insulation under the limitations imposed by Section 602 of the International  
Mechanical Code® \(IMC®\).  
KEY POINTS  
• Buildings are classified in general terms as combustible or noncombustible, as well as  
protected or unprotected.  
• Table 601 identifies the minimum required fire-resistance ratings of building elements  
based on the specified type of construction.  
• Unless a fire wall is utilized, or the special provisions of Section 510 are applied,  
structures can be classified into only one type of construction.  
• The structural frame is regulated in a manner apart from that of walls, floors, and roofs.  
• Type I and II buildings are considered noncombustible \(required\), whereas Type III, IV,  
and V buildings are viewed as combustible \(permitted\) construction.  
• Mass timber buildings of Types IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C construction vary based upon  
the percentage of mass timber surfaces that can be unprotected.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation• Very few structures fully comply with the provisions for Type IV-HT construction;  
however, many buildings contain some heavy-timber elements.  
• Type V buildings are by far the most common type of construction.  
• Various reductions in fire resistance are permitted for nonbearing partitions.  
• Combustible materials identified in Section 603 are permitted in otherwise  
noncombustible construction \(Types I and II\).

Key Points  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe types of construction and the fire-resistance requirements of the International Building  
Code® \(IBC®\) are based on the concept of fire endurance. Fire endurance is the length of time  
during which a fire-resistive construction assembly will confine a fire to a given area, or  
continue to perform structurally once exposed to fire, or both. In the IBC, the fire endurance of  
an assembly is usually expressed as a “  
\_\_\_  
-hour fire-resistance-rated assembly.  
” Chapter 7  
prescribes test criteria for the determination of the fire-resistance rating of construction  
assemblies and components, details of construction of many assemblies and components that  
have already been tested, and other information necessary to secure the intent of the code as  
far as the fire resistance and the fire endurance of construction assemblies and components are  
concerned. Additionally, Chapter 7 addresses other construction items that must be  
incorporated into a building’s design in order to safeguard against the spread of fire and smoke  
Section 702 Multiple Use Fire Assemblies  
This section serves as a reminder that assemblies can serve multiple purposes and therefore must  
be capable of meeting all of the applicable requirements imposed due to those differing purposes.  
For example, a door in a rated corridor generally has only a 20-minute fire-protection rating  
along with smoke- and draft-control protection. If the door was also serving as a separation  
between occupancies, it may need a higher fire-protection rating based on the requirements of  
Tables 508.4 and 716.1\(2\), but it would still need the smoke- and draft-control protection  
required by Section 716.2.2.1.1 to protect the opening into the corridor.  
Section 703 Fire-Resistance Ratings and Fire Tests  
It is the intent of the IBC that materials and methods used for fire-resistance purposes are limited  
to those specified in this chapter. Materials and assemblies tested in accordance with ASTM  
E119 or UL 263 are considered to be in full compliance with the code, as are building  
components whose fire-resistance rating has been achieved by one of the alternative methods  
specified in Section 703.2.2.  
703.2 Fire-resistance ratings. This section indicates that building elements are considered to  
have a fire-resistance rating when tested in accordance with the procedures of ASTM E119 or  
UL 263. Figures 703-1 through 703-5 depict the fundamental testing requirements of the two  
standards. The intent of the IBC is that any material or assembly that successfully passes the end-  
point criteria depicted for the specified time period shall have its fire-endurance rating accepted  
and the assembly classified in accordance with the time during which the assembly successfully  
withstood the test. When conducting these fire tests, the standards and the code do not factor in  
or allow the installation of a sprinkler system as a part of the testing. Thus the ratings of the  
materials and assembly are established on the basis of its own merits and credit is not given for  
other features.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 703-1 Test furnaces.  
Although early fire testing in the United States began as long ago as the 1890s, the standard  
fire-endurance test procedure using a standard time-temperature curve and specifying fire-  
endurance ratings in hours was developed in 1918. The significance of 1918 and later standards  
is the fact that they were and are intended to be reproducible so that the test conducted at one  
testing facility can be compared with the test of the same assembly conducted at any other testing  
facility. An often-expressed criticism of a standard such as ASTM E119 or UL 263 is that “it  
does not represent the real world.  
” This is true in many cases, and for that reason it should not be  
thought of as representing the absolute behavior of a fire-resistance-rated assembly under most  
actual fires in buildings. There are too many variables that affect the fire endurance of an  
assembly during an actual fire, such as fuel load, room size, rate of oxygen supply, and restraint,  
to consider that the test establishes absolute values of the real-world fire endurance of an  
assembly. However, it is a severe test of the fire-resistive qualities of a material or an assembly,  
and because of its reproducibility, it provides a means of comparing assemblies.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 703-2 Floor assembly fire test.  
Figure 703-3 Conditions of acceptance—wall fire test.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 703-4 Combustible assembly for determining finish rating.  
In addition to the fire-endurance fire ratings obtained from the standard fire tests of ASTM  
E119 and UL 263, it is also possible to obtain, as expressed in the standard, the protective  
membrane performance for walls, partitions, and floor or roof assemblies. In the case of  
combustible walls or floor or roof assemblies, this is also referred to as the finish rating.  
Although the test standard does not limit the determination of the protective membrane  
performance to combustible assemblies, its greatest significance is with combustible assemblies.  
Figure 703-5 Alternative fire test of steel column protection.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe end-point criteria for determining the finish rating are that the average temperature at the  
surface of the protected materials shall not be greater than 250°F \(139°C\) above the beginning  
temperature. Furthermore, the maximum temperature at any measured point shall not be greater  
than 325°F \(181°C\) above the beginning temperature. These temperatures relate to the lower  
limit of ignition temperatures for wood. Figure 703-4 illustrates the determination of the finish  
rating for a wall assembly, which is usually determined during a fire-endurance test of the  
assembly.  
When conducting the standard fire test, the conditions of acceptance, also referred to as  
failure criteria and end-point criteria, of fire-resistance-rated assemblies are as follows\:  
1\. For load-bearing assemblies, the applied load must be successfully sustained during the  
time period for which classification is desired.  
2\. There shall be no passage of flame or gases hot enough to ignite cotton waste on the  
unexposed surfaces.  
3\. The average temperature rise on the unexposed surface shall not be more than 250°F  
\(139°C\) above the initial temperature during the time period of the test.  
4\. The maximum temperature on the unexposed surface shall not be more than 325°F  
\(181°C\) above the initial temperature during the time period of the test.  
5\. Walls or partitions shall withstand the hose-stream test without passage of flame or gases  
hot enough to ignite cotton waste on the unexposed side or the projection of water from  
the hose stream beyond the unexposed surface.  
In addition to the conditions of acceptance just described, load-carrying structural members in  
roof and floor assemblies are subject to special end-point temperatures for\:  
1\. Structural steel beams and girders—1,100°F \(593°C\) average at any cross section and  
1,300°F \(704°C\) for any individual thermocouple, for unrestrained assemblies.  
2\. Reinforcing steel in cast-in-place reinforced concrete beams and girders—1,100°F  
\(593°C\) average at any section.  
3\. Prestressing steel in prestressed concrete beams and girders—800°F \(427°C\) average at  
any section.  
4\. Steel deck floor and roof units—1,100°F \(593°C\) average on any one span.  
As columns are exposed to fire on all surfaces, the standard has special temperature and  
testing criteria for these members\:  
1\. The column is loaded so as to develop \(as nearly as practicable\) the working stresses  
contemplated by the structural design. The condition of acceptance is simply that the  
column sustains the load for the duration of the test period for which a classification is  
desired. Or,  
2\. Alternatively, a steel column may be tested without load, and the column will be tested in  
the furnace to determine the adequacy of the protection on the steel column. The test and  
end points are depicted in Figure 703-5.  
703.2.1.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction. At times, an interior wall or partition is  
constructed nonsymmetrically as far as its fire protection is concerned, with the membrane on  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationone side of the wall differing from that on the opposing side. Where the wall is to be fire-  
resistance rated, it must be tested from both sides in order to determine the fire-resistance rating  
to be assigned to the assembly. Based on the two tests, the shortest time period is determined to  
be the wall’s rating. An assembly tested from only one side may be approved by the building  
official, provided there is adequate evidence furnished to show that the wall was tested with the  
least fire-resistive side exposed to the furnace. The provisions for exterior walls of  
nonsymmetrical construction differ somewhat from those addressing interior walls and are  
regulated by Section 705.5.  
703.2.1.3 Restrained classification. A dual classification system is used in ASTM E119 and UL  
263 for roof and floor assemblies, including their structural members. This dual classification  
system involves the use of the terms restrained and unrestrained. The use of the word restrained  
entails the concept of thermal restraint \(restrained against thermal expansion as well as against  
rotation at the ends of an assembly or structural member\).  
For example, if a structural beam of a uniform cross section is subjected to heat on its bottom  
surface, such as would be the case in the standard test furnace, it will attempt to expand in all  
directions with the longitudinal expansion being the primary component. If the beam is  
restrained at the ends so that it cannot expand, compressive stresses will build up within the  
beam, and it will in effect behave in a similar fashion as a prestressed beam. As a result, the  
thermal restraint will be beneficial in terms of improving the beam’s ability to sustain the applied  
load during the fire test. If the same beam is restrained only for the lower one-half of its cross  
section, it will tend to deflect upward owing to the conditions of restraint. This upward deflection  
tendency is also considered to enhance the beam’s ability to sustain the applied load during a  
fire-endurance test.  
Conversely, if the end restraint is applied only to the upper half of the beam’s cross section,  
the beam will tend to deflect downward and, in this case, the restraint will be detrimental to the  
beam’s ability to sustain the applied load during the fire-endurance test. As the heat is applied to  
the bottom surface during a fire, it creates a downward deflection, and the two downward  
deflections are additive. In an actual building, this could lead to premature failure. It can be seen,  
then, that thermal restraint may be either beneficial or detrimental to the fire-resistant assembly,  
depending on its means of application in the building.  
General guidance for the building official is provided in ASTM E119 and UL 263 as to what  
conditions in the constructed building provide restraint. It is generally agreed that an interior  
panel of a monolithically cast-in-place reinforced-concrete floor slab would be considered to  
have thermal restraint. Also, Footnote k to Table 721.1\(1\) provides that “interior spans of  
continuous slabs, beams and girders may be considered restrained.  
” Conversely, because the  
restraint present in many construction systems cannot be determined so neatly, the IBC requires  
that these assemblies be considered unrestrained unless the registered design professional shows  
by the requisite analysis and details that the system qualifies for a restrained classification.  
Furthermore, the code requires that any construction assembly that is to be considered restrained  
be identified as such on the drawings.  
703.2.1.5 Exterior bearing walls. This section is intended to modify the acceptance criteria for  
exterior bearing walls so that the walls will receive a rating based on which of the two following  
sets of criteria occurs first during the test\:  
1\. Heat transmission or flame and hot gases transmission for nonbearing walls.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. Structural failure or hose-stream application failure.  
The first set of end points measures the wall’s ability to prevent the spread of fire from one  
side to the opposite side. It is considered overly restrictive to require that exterior bearing walls  
comply with this first set of end points for a longer time than would be required for a nonbearing  
wall located with the same fire separation distance if it is still structurally capable of carrying the  
superimposed loads.  
703.3 Analytical methods. In addition to those assemblies and materials considered fire-  
resistance-rated construction based on designs certified by an approved agency, a number of  
other methods for determining fire resistance are set forth in this section. Where it can be  
determined that the fire-resistance rating of a building element is in conformance with one of the  
five listed methods or procedures, such a rating is considered acceptable. The fire exposure and  
acceptance criteria of ASTM E119 or UL 263 are the basis for applying all of the methods,  
enabling consistent and compliant application regardless of the method used.  
703.2.3 Approved alternative method. This section simply serves as a reminder that the code  
does accept alternative materials and methods based on Section 104.11. Any potential alternate  
must be “approved” and needs to be shown to be equivalent to the performance that is specified  
by the code. So while the testing or analytical methods of Sections 703.2.1 and 703.2.2 would  
generally be used in the vast majority of designs, the code will still permit other options as long  
as they can be justified and shown to be effective.  
703.3 Noncombustibility tests. Throughout the IBC, particularly in Chapter 6, the terms  
combustible and noncombustible are used. Under many different conditions, limits are placed on  
the use of combustible building materials, particularly in buildings of Type I or II construction.  
This section sets forth the two methods for determining if a material is noncombustible.  
For most materials, ASTM E136 is the test standard used to determine if a material is  
noncombustible. The code will also accept using the ASTM E2652 test standard and equipment  
provided the ASTM E136 acceptance criteria are used. The ASTM E2652 test is based on the  
international standard for noncombustibility. The exception will accept a composite of materials  
such as gypsum board, which have a structural base of noncombustible materials with a limited  
amount of combustible surface material. The surfacing material is limited in both thickness and  
flame spread.  
Note that the term noncombustible does not apply to surface finish materials or trim.  
703.4 Fire-resistance-rated glazing. The use of fire-resistance-rated glazing typically only  
occurs where the limitations placed on fire-protection-rated glazing make it undesirable or  
impractical. Fire-resistance-rated glazing is subjected to the ASTM E119 or UL 263 testing  
criteria, which include stringent limitations on temperature rise through the assembly. Because  
the glazing is regulated as a wall assembly rather than an opening protective, its use is not  
limited by any of the provisions of Section 716. It is only regulated under the appropriate code  
requirements for a fire-resistance-rated wall assembly.  
The labeling requirements specific to fire-resistance-rated glazing are set forth in Table  
716.1\(1\). The table indicates that glazing intended to meet the wall assembly criteria be  
identified with the marking “W-XXX.  
” The “W” indicates that the glazing meets the  
requirements of ASTM E119 or UL 263, thus qualifying the glazing to be used as a part of a wall  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationassembly. It also indicates that the glazing meets the fire-resistance, hose-stream, and  
temperature-rise requirements of the test standard. The fire-resistance rating of the glazing  
\(shown in minutes\) will then follow the “W” designation.  
703.5 Marking and identification. The integrity of fire and/or smoke separation walls is subject  
to compromise during the life of a building. During maintenance and remodel activities, it is not  
uncommon for new openings and penetrations to be installed in a fire or smoke separation  
without the recognition that the integrity of the construction must be maintained or that some  
type of fire or smoke protective is required. The reduction or elimination of protection that  
occurs is typically not malicious. Rather, the installation of an inappropriate air opening, or the  
penetration of the separation without the proper firestopping, is often done due to the lack of  
information regarding the wall assembly’s function and required fire rating.  
Through the identification of fire and smoke separation elements, it is possible for  
tradespeople, maintenance workers, and inspectors to recognize the required level of protection  
that must be maintained. The requirements apply to all wall assemblies where openings or  
penetrations are required to be protected. This would include exterior fire-resistance-rated walls  
as well as fire walls, fire barriers, fire partitions, smoke barriers, and smoke partitions. The  
identifying markings must be located within 15 feet \(4,572 mm\) of the ends of the wall and at  
maximum 30-foot intervals \(9,144-mm\) to increase the possibility that they would be visible  
during any work on the wall assemblies. A minimum letter height of 3 inches \(76 mm\) is also  
prescribed along with sample language for the marking. See Figure 703-6.  
It is intended that the identification marks be located in areas not visible to the general public.  
Specific locations set forth in the provisions indicate that the identification is to be provided  
within those concealed spaces that are accessible, such as above suspended ceilings and in attic  
areas.  
703.6 Determination of noncombustible protection time contribution. When dealing with  
mass timber elements, Section 703.6 provides a performance path to determine the contribution  
of the noncombustible protection to the overall fire-resistance rating of the assembly or element.  
This process involves comparative testing of the assembly, both with and without the  
noncombustible protection to determine the time, in minutes, the noncombustible covering  
provides. This time contribution will be used in meeting the protection requirements in Section  
602.4 and the required fire-resistance ratings needed for Type IV mass timber buildings. While  
Section 703.6 provides a performance method that requires testing to demonstrate compliance,  
Section 722.7 provides a prescriptive method which can be used in lieu of this testing procedure.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 703-6 Identification sign for fire barrier.  
703.7 Sealing of adjacent mass timber elements. The abutting edges and intersections between  
mass timber elements are required to be sealed to limit the spread of fire, smoke, and hot gasses  
through the gaps. Where mass timber elements are required to fire-resistance rated and they abut  
other rated elements–either mass timber or other materials—sealants or adhesives are generally  
required to resist the passage of air. Filling these gaps helps maintain the fire-resistance rating  
and is required unless fire tests have shown the protection is not required. The importance of this  
sealing requirement is so important that it is addressed in Section 1705.20 with a requirement for  
periodic special inspections.  
Section 704 Fire-Resistance Rating of Structural Members  
Structural frame members such as columns, beams, and girders are regulated for fire resistance  
based on a building’s type of construction. Some types of constructions mandate a higher level of  
fire endurance for structural members and assemblies on account of the critical nature of their  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfunction. Type of construction considerations is based primarily on the potential for building  
collapse when subjected to fire. Therefore, the structural frame is specifically addressed in Table  
601 as to the required fire-resistance ratings. This section provides further details for the  
protection of structural members.  
Figure 704-1 Mass effect.  
Figure 704-1 provides simple details of fire protection of structural members that indicate the  
principle of mass effect. Mass effect is beneficial to the protection requirements for structural  
members of a heavy cross section. In the case of steel members, the amount of protection  
depends on the weight of the structural steel member. A heavy, massive structural steel cross  
section behaves such that the heat applied to the surface during a fire is absorbed away from the  
surface, resulting in lower steel surface temperatures. Thus, the insulating thicknesses indicated  
by tests or in Table 721.1\(1\) should not be used for members with a smaller weight than that  
specified in the test or table.  
704.2 Column protection. Primary structural frame members generally require fire-resistive  
protection in all but Type II-B, III-B, IV-HT, and V-B construction. Under all conditions,  
columns are considered as a part of the primary structural frame system and must be protected by  
individual encasement. This protection must occur on all sides of the column and extend for the  
column’s full height. Where a ceiling is provided, the fire resistance of the column is to be  
continuous from the top of the foundation or floor/ceiling assembly below through the ceiling  
space to the top of the column. The fire protection required for the column shall also be provided  
at the connections between the column and any beams or girders. Where located within a fire-  
resistance-rated wall assembly as shown in Figure 704-2, the column must be protected through  
individual encasement unless within the limits of Section 704.4.1. It is not acceptable to place an  
unprotected column within a fire-resistance-rated wall assembly and consider the column as fire-  
resistant rated.  
704.3 Protection of the primary structural frame other than columns. Where primary  
structural frame members support the load from multiple levels, the code looks to reduce the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationlikelihood of structural failure and the potential for catastrophic collapse. To improve the level of  
protection, the code requires individual encasement of the structural member where it supports  
more than two floors or one floor and a roof, or supports a load-bearing wall or nonload-bearing  
wall more than two stories in height. In general, the individual encasement is to be protecting all  
sides of the member, but the exception allows the protection to only be on the “exposed sides.  
”  
Figure 704-2 Individual protection of structural columns.  
Where individual encasement is not required, the code allows the use of a floor/ceiling or  
roof/ceiling assembly to provide protection for the structural member. This is based on the  
differences in both the testing procedure and the conditions of acceptance that were discussed in  
Section 703.2. The use of the horizontal assembly’s ceiling membrane protection in lieu of  
individual encasement applies only to horizontal structural members, such as girders, trusses,  
beams, or lintels. \(See Section 704.2 for column protection.\)  
Examples of various conditions are shown in Figure 704.3.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 704-3 Protection of primary structural frame members.  
704.4 Protection of secondary structural members. Secondary structural members, as defined  
in Section 202, may be protected in the same manner as primary structural frame members,  
where a fire-resistance rating is required. Such elements can be individually encased or protected  
by a membrane or ceiling of a horizontal assembly. The subsections provide specific exemptions  
for allowing certain vertical and horizontal secondary structural members to be protected by a  
membrane as opposed to individual protection. Floor joists and roof joists are examples of  
secondary members that are permitted to be protected by the horizontal assembly in which they  
are located. In light-frame wall construction, membrane protection is also permitted for studs,  
columns, and boundary elements that are integral elements “between the top and bottom plates”  
of the wall. When dealing with the light-frame wall elements, it is important to recognize the  
limitations in Section 704.4.1 in order to distinguish between it and the individual encasement  
required by Section 704.2.  
704.5 Truss protection. Trusses can vary greatly from not only the materials and sizes of the  
members but also whether the protection encapsulates the entire truss or the individual elements.  
When establishing the appropriate protection, it is the intent of the code that the thickness and  
details of construction of the fire-resistive protection be based on the results of full-scale tests or  
of tests on truss components. Approved calculations based on such tests that show that the truss  
components provide the fire endurance required by the code are also acceptable. One application  
of this concept is in the use of the encapsulated trusses as dividing partitions between hotel  
rooms in multistory steel-frame buildings. Because the truss becomes part of the primary  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstructural frame where it is used to span between exterior wall columns, it provides a column-  
free interior. The fire-resistive design of the encapsulated protection can be based either on tests  
or on analogies derived from fire tests.  
Anything that can reduce, interrupt, or damage the fire-resistive protective material can affect  
the performance. Thus, Sections 704.6 through 704.9 address some of these situations and what  
is accepted or required. Some of the additional criteria for the protection of primary structural  
members are illustrated in Figures 704-4 and 704-5, which depict details for attached metal  
members and reinforcing discussed in Sections 704.6 and 704.7. The provisions of Section 704.9  
for impact protection are also illustrated in Figure 704-6.  
704.10 Exterior structural members. The code provides that structural frame elements in the  
exterior wall or along the outer lines of a building must be protected based on the higher rating of  
three criteria. The minimum fire-resistance rating is determined by evaluating the requirements  
for \(1\) the structural frame per Table 601, \(2\) exterior bearing walls per Table 601, and \(3\) fire  
separation distance per Table 705.5. The highest of these three ratings is the minimum required  
rating of the structural members. See Application Example 704-1.  
Application Example 704-1  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 704-4 Protection of structural steel column.  
Figure 704-5 Reinforcing steel in concrete joists.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 704-6 Impact protection.  
The intent of the provisions is that the structural frame should never have a lower fire rating  
than that required to protect the frame from internal fires. Nevertheless, if the exposure hazard  
from an external source is so great as to require exterior wall protection, a higher rating may be  
required.  
704.11 Bottom flange protection. Exempted from the requirements for fire protection in  
buildings of fire-resistance-rated construction are the bottom flanges of short-span lintels, and  
shelf angles or plates that are part of the structural frame. It is assumed by the code that the  
arching action of the masonry or concrete above the lintel will prevent anything more than just a  
localized failure. Furthermore, only the bottom flange is permitted to be unprotected and, as a  
result, the wall supported by the lintel will act as a heat sink to draw heat away from the lintel  
and thereby increase the length of time until failure that is due to heat. This latter rationale also  
applies to shelf angles and plates that are not considered as a part of the structural frame. The  
limitation to spans no greater than 6 feet 4 inches \(1,931 mm\) is intended to allow such  
unprotected lintels and angles where a pair of 36-inch \(914-mm\) doors is installed in the  
opening.  
Section 705 Exterior Walls  
Because of the potential for radiant heat exposure from one building to another, either on  
adjoining sites or on the same site, the IBC regulates the construction of exterior walls for fire  
resistance. Opening protection in such walls may also be required based on the fire separation  
distances involved. In addition to the regulation of exterior walls and openings in such walls, the  
code addresses associated projections, parapets, and joints.  
705.2 Projections. Architectural considerations quite often call for projections from exterior  
walls such as cornices, eave overhangs, and balconies. Where these projections are from walls  
that are in close proximity to a lot line, they create problems that are due to trapping the  
convected heat from a fire in an adjacent building. As this trapped heat increases the hazard for  
the building under consideration, the code mandates a minimum distance the leading edge of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprojecting element must be separated from the line used to determine fire separation distance.  
The permitted extent of projections is established by Table 705.2 and based solely on the clear  
distance between the building’s exterior wall and an interior lot line, centerline of a public way,  
or assumed imaginary line between two buildings on the same lot. Where the distance is less  
than 2 feet \(609 mm\), all types of projections are prohibited. As the clear distance increases to 2  
feet \(609 mm\) and beyond, projections are permitted; however, the extent of such projections is  
regulated.  
The reference to multiple buildings on the same lot is intended to address only those  
projections that extend beyond the opposing exterior walls of the adjacent buildings. For those  
exterior walls that directly oppose each other, the limits on projecting elements are not applicable  
where the two buildings are being considered as a single building under Exception 1 to Section  
705.3\. However, those projections that occur at exterior walls not located in opposition to those  
exterior walls of an adjacent building are to be regulated by the provisions of Section 705.2. The  
application of the exception to Section 705.2 is shown in Figure 705-1.  
Projections from buildings are further regulated in order to prevent a fire hazard from  
inappropriate use of combustible materials attached to exterior walls. Thus, the IBC requires that  
projections from walls of Type I or II buildings be of noncombustible materials. However, it  
should be noted that certain combustible materials are permitted for balconies and similar  
projections as well as bay windows and oriel windows in accordance with Sections 705.2.3.1 and  
705.2.4.  
For buildings that the code considers to be of combustible construction \(Type III, IV, or V  
construction\), both combustible and noncombustible materials are permitted in the construction  
of projections. Where combustible projections are used and extend within a distance of 5 feet  
\(1,524 mm\) to the line where fire separation distance is measured \(interior lot line, centerline of a  
public way, or assumed imaginary line between two buildings on the same lot\), the code requires  
that they be of at least 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction, of heavy-timber construction,  
constructed of fire-retardant-treated wood, or as required in Section 705.2.3.1 for balconies and  
similar projections. This requirement is based on a potential for a severe exposure hazard and,  
consequently, the code intends that combustible materials be protected or, alternatively, be of  
heavy-timber construction, which has comparable performance when exposed to fire. An  
example is shown in Figure 705-2.  
Because projections are typically regulated independent of the roof construction, it is entirely  
possible that their construction types may be inconsistent. For example, Figure 705-3 shows two  
situations where the roof construction and resulting projections may differ in their required  
protection. Figure A relates a Type VA building with a 1-hour fire-resistance-rated roof system  
but a nonrated projection. On the other hand, Figure B indicates a Type VB building with  
nonrated roof construction but a minimum 1-hour-protected projection. In each case, the roof  
construction and its projection are regulated differently because of the concept of fire resistance  
being applied.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 705-1 Two buildings regulated as a single building on the lot.  
Figure 705-2 Protection of combustible projections.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 705-3 Projection versus roof protection.  
Balconies and similar projecting elements in buildings of Type I and II construction are to be  
constructed of noncombustible materials, unless the building is no more than three stories in  
height above grade plane. Under this condition, fire-retardant-treated wood may be used where  
the balcony or similar element is not used as a required egress path. Unless constructed of  
complying heavy-timber members, a combustible balcony or similar combustible projection  
must have a minimum fire-resistance rating equivalent to the required floor construction.  
In Type III, IV, and V buildings, balcony construction may be of any material permitted by  
the code, combustible, or noncombustible. Where a fire-resistance rating is mandated by the  
code, it must be maintained at the projecting element unless sprinkler protection is provided or it  
is of Type IV construction.  
In addition to these types of construction limitations, the aggregate length of all projections  
cannot exceed 50 percent of the building perimeter at each floor unless sprinkler protection is  
extended to the balcony areas. In all cases, the use of untreated wood or certain plastic  
composites is permitted for pickets, rails, and similar guard elements when limited to a height of  
42 inches \(1,067 mm\).  
705.3 Buildings on the same lot. The IBC regulates exterior wall construction, opening  
protection, and projection extent and protection based on the proximity of the exterior walls to  
lot lines, either real or assumed. This section provides the code requirements for the  
establishment of imaginary lines between buildings on the same lot. Where two or more  
buildings are to be erected on the same site, the determination of the code requirements for  
protection of the exterior walls is based on placing an assumed imaginary line between buildings.  
Figure 705-4 illustrates an example of two nonsprinklered Type IIIB buildings housing Group S-  
2 occupancies sharing a 30-foot-wide \(9,144-mm\) yard, and it is noted that the imaginary line  
can be located anywhere between the two buildings so that the best advantage can be taken of  
wall and opening protection, depending on the use and architectural considerations for the  
exterior walls of the buildings. For example, if unprotected openings amounting to 25 percent of  
the area of the exterior walls of each nonsprinklered building were desired, the imaginary line  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwould be located so that the distance between it and each building would permit such an amount  
of unprotected openings. Thus, the code would require that each building be placed at least 15  
feet \(4,572 mm\) from the imaginary line in order to have unprotected openings totaling 25  
percent of each opposing wall area. If one of the buildings was to have no openings in the  
exterior wall, the imaginary line could be placed at the exterior wall of the building without  
openings. The other building would be located at a distance of 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) or more from  
the imaginary line and the other building. In the first case described, the opposing nonbearing  
exterior walls would both be required to be of minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction  
as they are each located less than 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) from the imaginary line. However, the wall  
located 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) from the imaginary line would not require any fire rating. Also, in the  
last example, Section 705.11 could possibly require that the exterior wall on the assumed lot line  
be provided with a parapet. See discussion of Section 705.11.  
In the case where a new building is to be erected on the same lot as an existing building, the  
same rationale applies as depicted in Figure 705-4, except that the exterior wall, opening, and  
projection protection of the existing building determine the location of the assumed imaginary  
line. As shown in Figure 705-5, the exterior wall and opening protection of the existing building  
must remain in compliance with the provisions of the IBC.  
Figure 705-4 Buildings on the same lot.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 705-5 Buildings on the same lot.  
As an alternative, where two or more buildings are located on the same lot, they may be  
considered to be a single building subject to specified limitations. For further discussion of this  
condition, see the commentary on Section 503.1.2.  
705.5 Fire-resistance ratings. The IBC requires that exterior walls conform to the required fire-  
resistance ratings of Tables 601 and 705.5. Bearing walls must comply with the more restrictive  
requirements of both tables, whereas nonbearing exterior walls need only comply with Table  
705.5\. Table 601 is intended to address the fire endurance of bearing walls necessary to prevent  
building collapse that is due to fire for a designated time period. Table 705.5 is used to determine  
the required fire-resistance ratings that are due to exterior fire exposure from adjacent buildings,  
as well as the interior fire exposure that adjacent buildings are exposed to on account of the uses  
sheltered by the exterior walls. Where structural frame members are located within exterior  
walls, or on the outside of the building, compliance with Section 704.10 is required. Examples of  
the use of these provisions are shown in Application Examples 704-1 and 705-1.  
Section 703.2.1.1 addresses nonsymmetrical interior wall construction, whereas this section of  
the code addresses nonsymmetrical construction for exterior walls. This method of construction,  
which provides for a different membrane on each side of the supporting elements, is much more  
typical for exterior applications. As an example, a nonsymmetrical exterior wall may consist of  
wood studs covered with gypsum board on the inside, with sheathing and siding on the exterior  
side. See Figure 705-6. Where exterior walls have a fire separation distance of more than 10 feet  
\(3,048 mm\), the fire-resistance rating is allowed to be determined based only on interior fire  
exposure. This recognizes the reduced risk that is due to the setback from the lot line. For fire  
separation distances greater than 10 feet \(3,048 mm\), the hazard is considered to be  
predominantly from inside the building. See Figure 705-7. Thus, fire-resistance-rated  
construction whose tests are limited to interior fire exposure is considered sufficient evidence of  
adequate fire resistance under these circumstances. However, at a distance of 10 feet \(3,048 mm\)  
or less, there is the additional hazard of direct fire exposure from a building on the adjacent lot  
and the possibility that it may lead to self-ignition at the exterior face of the exposed building.  
Therefore, exterior walls located very close to any lot line must be rated for exposure to fire from  
both sides. The listings of various fire-resistance-rated exterior walls will indicate if they were  
only tested for exposure from the inside, usually by a designation of “FIRE SIDE” or similar  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationterminology. Where so listed, their use is limited to those applications where the wall need only  
be rated from the interior side. It should be noted that this allowance is generally applicable  
regardless of why the wall requires a rating. Using a Type VA building as an example, those  
exterior bearing walls required by Table 601 to be minimum 1-hour walls need only be rated for  
exposure to fire from the interior side if they are located such that the fire separation distance is  
more than 10 feet \(3,048 mm\). The vertical separation requirements of Section 705.8.5 contain a  
specific provision which mandates protection from both the interior and the exterior. This would  
override the exclusion for exterior protection found in Section 705.5 and protect the building  
from flames coming out of a lower opening and impinging on an opening above.  
Figure 705-6 Nonsymmetrical exterior wall construction.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 705-7 Nonsymmetrical exterior wall ratings.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 705-1  
Table 705.5—Fire-Resistance Rating Requirements for Exterior Walls Based on Fire  
Separation Distances. The IBC, as far as exterior wall protection is concerned, operates on the  
philosophy that an owner can have no control over what occurs on an adjacent lot and, therefore,  
the location of buildings on the owner’s lot must be regulated relative to the lot line. In fact, the  
location of all buildings and structures on a given piece of property is addressed in relation to the  
real lot lines as well as any assumed or imaginary lines between buildings on the same lot. The  
assumption of imaginary lines was discussed in Section 705.3.  
The lot-line concept provides a convenient means of protecting one building from another  
insofar as exposure is concerned. Exposure is the potential for heat to be transmitted from one  
building to another under conditions in the exposing building. Radiation is the primary means of  
heat transfer.  
The code specifically provides that the fire separation distance be measured to the center line  
of a street, alley, or public way. As the code refers to public way, this would also be applicable to  
appropriate open spaces other than streets or alleys that the building official may determine are  
reasonably likely to remain unobstructed through the years.  
The regulations for exterior wall protection based on proximity to the lot line are contained in  
Table 705.5. The IBC indicates that the distances are measured at right angles to the face of the  
exterior wall \(see definition of “Fire separation distance” in Section 202\), which would result in  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe fire-resistive requirements for exterior walls not applying to walls that are at right angles to  
the lot line. See Figure 705-8.  
Figure 705-8 Fire separation distance.  
In order to properly utilize Table 705.5, it is necessary to identify the fire separation distance,  
the occupancies involved, and the building’s type of construction. As the fire separation distance  
increases, the fire-resistance rating requirements are reduced, based on the occupancy group  
under consideration. Figure 705-9 illustrates the application of exterior wall protection where the  
exterior walls of the building are parallel and perpendicular to the lot line. In this case, the  
illustration assumes that the building is one story of Type VB construction and used for offices  
\(Group B\). Referring to Table 705.5, it is noted that exterior walls less than 10 feet \(3,048 mm\)  
from the lot line must be of minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction. Figure 705-10  
depicts a similar building located such that one of the exterior walls is not parallel and  
perpendicular to the lot line, but is at some angle other than 90 degrees \(1.57 rad\). The regulation  
of doors, windows, and other openings in exterior walls is addressed in the discussion of Section  
705.8.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 705-9 Exterior wall rating.  
Figure 705-10 Exterior wall rating.  
Several footnotes to the table address modifications to the general requirements. Footnote a  
repeats a previous requirement that load-bearing exterior walls must comply with both Tables  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation601 and 705.5.  
Although Table 705.5 requires a Group S-2 occupancy of Type I, II, or IV construction to  
have a minimum 1-hour exterior wall where the fire separation distance is less than 30 feet  
\(9,144 mm\), Footnote c reduces that distance significantly where it is a complying open parking  
garage. Under such conditions, a minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated exterior wall is required  
only where the fire separation distance is less than 10 feet. Footnote d indicates that each story of  
the building is regulated independently for the fire separation distance provisions, as shown in  
Figure 705-11.  
Figure 705-11 Fire separation distance measurement.  
Table 705.8 allows for an unlimited amount of unprotected openings in exterior walls of a  
sprinklered building that has a fire separation distance of at least 20 feet \(6,096 mm\). However,  
in certain buildings, Table 705.5 requires those same exterior walls to be fire-resistance rated for  
a minimum of 1 hour. Footnote g recognizes that any nonbearing exterior wall permitted to be  
entirely open due to the unlimited unprotected opening allowances of Table 705.8 need not be  
required to have a fire-resistance rating due to fire separation distance.  
There are only a small percentage of buildings where this footnote is applicable. It has no  
effect on\:  
• Exterior bearing walls  
• Group H-1, H-2, and H-3 occupancies  
• Nonsprinklered buildings  
• Buildings of Type IIB and VB construction, other than Groups H-4 and H-5  
• Exterior walls with a fire separation distance of less than 20 feet \(6,096 mm\)  
• Exterior walls with a fire separation distance of 30 feet or more \(9,144 mm\)  
705.6 Structural stability. This section refers the code user to Section 705.11 for parapets in  
determining the required height of exterior walls. It also addresses the two conditions regarding  
elements used to brace the exterior wall. Where such elements are located within the plane of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwall \(as part of the wall assembly\) or on the outside of the wall, the bracing members are to be  
regulated for both external fire exposure and internal fire exposure based on the references to  
Tables 601 and 705.5. Those bracing elements that occur within the building, such as floor joists  
and/or roof joists that frame into the exterior wall, are also required to be protected from internal  
fire exposure if mandated by Table 601. However, external fire exposure concerns addressed in  
Table 705.5 are not specifically addressed. Floor systems, roof systems, and other elements that  
provide lateral bracing from the interior side of an exterior wall are only required to be fire-  
resistance rated when required by Table 601.  
705.7 Unexposed surface temperature. The provisions of this section provide a reduction of  
the prescriptive fire-resistance requirements for exterior walls under certain conditions. A fire-  
resistance-rated wall is generally required to meet the conditions of acceptance of ASTM E119  
or UL 263 for fire endurance and hose-stream tests on the surface exposed to the test fire, and  
heat-transmission limits on the unexposed surface. At fire separation distances beyond the point  
where openings are not permitted, typically 3 feet \(914 mm\), two more options are available\:  
1\. Where opening protection is required, but the percentage of opening protection is not  
limited \[typically a fire-separation distance of 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) or more\], compliance  
with the heat-transmission limits of ASTM E119 or UL 263 is not required. This  
recognizes that, although heat transmission is an important consideration for interior  
walls, the fire hazard that the limit addresses is substantially reduced once the exterior  
wall of a building is set back far enough that the fire hazard it presents to \(and receives  
from\) a building on an adjacent lot does not warrant a limit on the percentage of opening  
protection to limit the hazard. It has the effect of compliance with the conditions of  
acceptance for fire assemblies of the same hourly rating.  
According to NFPA 252 for fire door assemblies and NFPA 257 for fire window  
assemblies, nearly identical conditions of acceptance for fire endurance and hose-stream  
tests are required, but without limits on heat transmission. Because an unlimited  
percentage of opening protection is allowed, the lack of a heat transmission limit for  
exterior walls is consistent with that for fire door and fire window assemblies. An exterior  
wall that does not meet the heat transmission limits is considered equivalent to an opening  
protective of the same hourly rating in its reduced ability to limit heat transmission.  
2\. Where the percentage of opening protection is limited \[typically having a fire separation  
distance between 3 feet \(914 mm\) and 20 feet \(6,096 mm\)\], a similar reduction is  
possible, provided a correction is made according to the formula presented in this section.  
The formula converts the actual proposed area of protected openings to an increased  
equivalent area in proportion to the area of exterior wall surface under consideration that  
lacks adequate control of heat transmission. It places additional limits on the allowable  
percentage of opening protection.  
The formula increases the required percentage of opening protection, whereas Section 705.8  
sets limits on the percentage. Relative to the limitations of Section 705.8, this method allows for  
a smaller percentage of opening protection at the same fire separation distance. Thus, a greater  
fire separation distance is required to maintain the same percentage of opening protection. The  
reduction of the heat transmission capacity of the exterior walls is compensated by a reduction in  
the allowable percentage of opening protection. Without this provision, a fire-resistance-rated  
exterior wall that does not meet the heat transmission limits would not be allowed.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIf actual test results or other substantiating data are available, they may be used in the  
computations. In their absence, the standard time-temperature curve of ASTM E119 and UL 263  
would be used, which results in an equivalent area of protected openings equal to the actual area  
of protected openings plus the exterior wall area without adequate control of heat transmission  
per ASTM E119 and UL 263. This is converted into a percentage of opening protection and  
compared to the limits of Section 705.8. The use of actual test results may reduce this effect. See  
Section 705.8 for the basic limits prior to modification by this provision.  
705.8.1 Allowable area of openings. Openings in an exterior wall typically consist of windows  
and doors. Occasionally, air openings such as vents are also present. The maximum area of either  
protected or unprotected openings permitted in each story of an exterior wall is regulated by this  
section. In addition, both unprotected and protected openings are permitted in the same exterior  
wall based on a unity formula. The term protected in this section refers to those elements such as  
fire doors, fire windows, and fire shutters regulated in Section 716. Protected openings have the  
mandated fire-protection rating necessary to perform their function. Unprotected openings are  
simply those exterior openings that do not qualify as protected openings. Opening protection  
presents a higher fire risk than fire-resistance-rated construction insofar as it does not meet the  
heat transmission limits of ASTM E119 or UL 263, as previously discussed. At increasing  
distances from where openings are no longer prohibited, the hazard from heat radiation  
decreases, allowing the percentage of openings, both protected and unprotected, to increase. The  
high hazard of heat exposure at small fire separation distances justifies the prohibition of  
openings in order to limit the percentage of wall area without adequate heat transmission limits.  
As the fire separation distance increases, the percentage of openings is allowed to increase in  
compensation. At greater distances, the limit on the percentage of opening protection is  
eliminated. This recognizes that, at greater distances, the lack of adequate control of heat  
transmission does not pose a significant hazard to adjacent buildings, but containment of the fire  
to its origin inside the exposed building is still important. The exterior wall and opening  
protection requirements apply on each individual story of the building based on the fire  
separation distance. This accounts for the exposure at each separate level and would relax the  
requirements where the building facade steps back and faces less radiant heat exposure.  
There is a distance from lot lines where the hazard is reduced to such a degree that all opening  
limitations are no longer warranted. At this point, exposure to and from adjacent buildings is not  
significant and the need for fire resistance at exterior walls is reduced to fire protection of  
bearing walls and structural members in order to delay building collapse in the event of fire.  
Arguably the most important provision is Exception 2 to Section 705.8.1. It indicates that if the  
exterior wall of the building and its primary exterior structural frame are not required by the code  
to have a fire-resistance rating, then unlimited unprotected openings are permitted. In other  
words, if the wall does not require a rating, any openings in the wall are unregulated for area and  
fire protection. An example is shown in Figure 705-12.  
Although not stated in the exception, only when Table 705.5 requires a fire-resistance rating  
does Table 705.8 limit the maximum area of exterior openings. Where some other provision of  
the code mandates a fire-resistance-rated exterior wall, such as an exterior bearing wall  
supporting a fire-resistance-rated horizontal assembly, the limitations of Table 705.8 do not  
apply. It is also not necessary to review Table 601 to apply the exception as the conditions are  
established in such a manner that Table 705.5 provides all of the necessary information. Directly  
stated, if Table 705.5 does not mandate a fire-resistance-rated exterior wall, an unlimited amount  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationof unprotected openings are permitted.  
The limitation on exterior openings is also not applicable for first-story openings in buildings  
of other than Group H as indicated in Exception 1 to Section 705.8.1. Limited in application, this  
exception allows an unlimited amount of unprotected openings at the first story under specified  
circumstances. Exception 1 is basically allowing the first floor of the building to use the entire  
width of the open space instead of the more limited fire separation distance which is usually a  
midpoint. Based on the clear space, access to the area, and the ease of protecting a lower story,  
the code permits these unlimited unprotected openings. The provisions are often used for  
opposing buildings having storefront systems. See Figure 705-13.  
Figure 705-12 Unlimited unprotected openings.  
How are exterior openings regulated in fully sprinklered buildings? Table 705.8 also  
recognizes an increase in the allowable area of unprotected exterior openings for those buildings  
that are provided with an automatic sprinkler system throughout. For example, the fire-  
resistance-rated exterior wall of a fully sprinklered building having a fire separation distance of  
15 feet \(4,572 mm\) may have 75 percent of its surface area consisting of unprotected openings. If  
the building is not sprinklered, the limit on unprotected openings is only 25 percent. In other than  
higher level Group H occupancies, the maximum permitted area of unprotected openings in an  
exterior wall is allowed to be the same as the tabulated limitations for protected openings,  
provided the building is protected throughout with an NFPA 13 automatic sprinkler system. The  
increased areas permitted due to sprinkler protection are all incorporated directly in Table 705.8.  
It is important to note that the presence of an automatic sprinkler system does not increase the  
maximum allowable opening area for protected openings. Whereas the benefits of such an  
increase would seem justifiable because of the increased level of protection, such an allowance is  
not addressed in the code. In addition, the unity formula \(Equation 7-2\) is not applicable to fully  
sprinklered buildings insofar as the code provides an increased allowance for unprotected  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationopenings to the amount permitted for protected openings.  
705.8.2 Protected openings. Section 716 is referenced for opening protection and addresses fire  
windows, fire doors, and fire shutters. The use of sprinklers and water curtains to eliminate the  
required opening protection is addressed in the exception. It indicates that where the building is  
sprinklered throughout, those openings protected by an approved water curtain do not need to be  
fire-protective assemblies. However, the exception has virtually no application when the  
provisions of Table 705.8 are implemented, as the table allows for the elimination of protected  
openings in sprinklered buildings without the need for water curtains. There are a number of  
provisions throughout the IBC where the exception could be used. For example, Section 1029.3  
typically mandates ¾-hour fire-protected openings in walls of egress courts less than 10 feet  
\(3,048 mm\) in width. In a fully sprinklered building, the use of a complying water curtain would  
eliminate the need for such openings to have a fire-protection rating. Another example where the  
exception might be applied includes Section 1023.7 where walls or openings of the building  
create an exposure hazard to interior exit stairways and ramps.  
Figure 705-13 Unlimited openings in the first story exterior wall.  
705.8.4 Mixed openings. Table 705.8 specifies the maximum allowable percentage of protected  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand unprotected openings, considered separately and based on fire separation distance alone. The  
unity formula \(Equation 7-2\) as set forth in Section 705.8.4 determines the maximum allowable  
area of protected and unprotected openings where they are proposed together in an exterior wall  
at an individual story of a nonsprinklered building. It offers a traditional interaction relationship,  
namely, the sum of the actual divided by the sum of the allowable cannot exceed one. An  
example of the determination of the maximum area of exterior wall openings, where both  
protected and unprotected openings are used, is provided in Application Example 705-2. The use  
of Equation 7-2 is limited to those buildings that are not provided with an NFPA 13 sprinkler  
system throughout. Where the building is fully sprinklered, the code provides no advantage  
where protected openings are provided.  
Application Example 705-2  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 705-14 Flame barriers.  
705.8.5 Vertical separation of openings. The intent of this section is to limit the vertical spread  
of fire from floor to floor at the exterior wall of the building. The code requires exterior flame  
barriers projecting out either from the wall or in line with the wall. These flame barriers are  
intended to prevent the leap-frogging effect of a fire at the outside of a building. See Figure 705-  
14\. However, there are three exceptions that eliminate the required barriers. The first is for  
buildings that are three stories or less in height. The second is for fully sprinklered buildings. The  
third exception is for open parking garages. It is probable that this provision will have very  
limited application, as it is doubtful there will be much new construction of four stories or more  
without sprinkler protection. The requirement for exterior wall barrier to be rated from both sides  
is a specific requirement that overrides Section 705.5 where wall has greater than 10 feet of fire  
separation distance. Provisions addressing the spread of fire from floor to floor on the interior  
side of an exterior wall, such as at the intersection of a floor and curtain wall system, are found  
in Sections 715.4 and 715.5.  
705.8.6 Vertical exposure. The scope of this section is limited to buildings located on the same  
lot and to the issue of the protection of openings in the exterior wall of a higher building above  
the roof of a lower building. It requires each opening in the exterior wall that is less than 15 feet  
\(4,572 mm\) above the roof of the lower building to be protected if the horizontal fire separation  
distance for each building is less than 15 feet \(4,572 mm\). See Figure 705-15. There is an  
exception that applies where the roof construction has at least a 1-hour fire-resistance rating, also  
illustrated in Figure 705-15. Application of this provision potentially mandates a higher level of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprotection than that required by the code for two buildings on separate adjoining lots. The  
presence of a lot line between two buildings institutes the concept of fire separation distance in  
the regulation of the opposing exterior walls and any openings in such walls. On a single lot with  
two buildings, the same concept is applied owing to the requirement for the placement of an  
assumed imaginary line between the buildings. This line is also the basis for regulating exterior  
wall and opening protection that is due to fire separation distance. The provisions of Section  
705.8.6 introduce additional requirements that may not be mandated on account of the fire  
separation distance concept. In addition, where two buildings are located on the same lot, the  
provisions of Sections 705.3 and 503.1.2 permit them to be considered a single building if the  
aggregate area of the buildings is within the limits of Chapter 5 for a single building. For  
consistent application of the fire separation distance concept, it would appear that the  
methodology for buildings on the same lot could be permitted to be used rather than the vertical  
exposure provisions of Section 705.8.6.  
Figure 705-15 Vertical exposure.  
It appears that the provision is intended to mirror the termination requirements and allowances  
for fire walls where located in stepped buildings as established in Section 706.6.1. It would be  
logical to assume that if a fire wall is not necessary to obtain code compliance, resulting in no  
required application of the fire wall termination requirements, the same concept should be  
considered when applying this provision to buildings on the same lot that can be regulated as a  
single building.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation705.11 Parapets. This section intends that the exterior walls of buildings shall extend a  
minimum of 30 inches \(762 mm\) above the roof to form a parapet. There are two reasons for the  
parapet\:  
1\. To prevent the spread of fire from the roof of the subject building to a nearby adjacent  
building.  
2\. To protect the roof of a building from exposure that is due to a fire in an adjacent nearby  
building.  
Most buildings do not have complying parapets, and those that do typically use them to hide  
the roof slope or roof-top equipment. Therefore, the exceptions to this section tend to become the  
general rule. Three of the six exceptions listed in the code—1, 3, and 6—involve cases where the  
parapet would serve no useful purpose. In Exception 2, a concession is made to the small-floor-  
area building, and in Exceptions 4 and 5, an alternative method for providing equivalent  
protection is delineated. It is not necessary that all of the exceptions listed apply. Compliance  
with only one of the exceptions is all that is necessary for the elimination of a complying parapet.  
Certainly, walls not required to be of fire-resistance-rated construction would not benefit from  
a parapet. In the case of walls that terminate at 2-hour fire-resistance-rated roofs or roofs  
constructed entirely of noncombustible materials, the parapet would be of little benefit, as the  
construction of the roof would prevent the spread of fire from or into the building. The exception  
for noncombustible roof construction is not intended to preclude the use of a classified roof  
covering.  
In the case of walls permitted to have unprotected openings in conformance with Exception 6,  
the code assumes that the exterior wall will be far enough away from either an exposing building  
or an exposed building so that the protection provided by the parapet will not be necessary. This  
distance will vary based on the presence of a sprinkler system in the building, as shown in Figure  
705-16.  
The fourth exception makes a provision for 1-hour fire-resistance-rated exterior walls that are  
constructed similar to 2-hour fire walls that terminate at the underside of the roof sheathing,  
deck, or slab. This provides designers with an alternative to the use of parapets while recognizing  
that these walls provide adequate protection of the structure and its occupants as well as  
consistency with Section 706.6 for fire walls. See Figure 705-17. Exception 5 applies only to  
Group R-2 and R-3 occupancies and is intended to protect at the roof line through the use of a  
noncombustible roof deck, fire-retardant-wood sheathing, or a gypsum-board underlayment.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 705-16 Parapet exception.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 705-17 Parapet alternative.  
705.11.1 Parapet construction. In addition to having the same degree of fire resistance as  
required for the wall, the code also requires that the surface of the parapet that faces the roof be  
of noncombustible materials for the upper 18 inches \(457 mm\). Thus, a fire that might be  
traveling along the roof and reaching the parapet will not be able to continue upward along the  
face of the parapet and over the top and expose a nearby adjacent building. The requirement only  
applies to the upper 18 inches \(457 mm\) of the parapet to allow for extending the roof covering  
up the base of the parapet so that it can be effectively flashed. The 18-inch \(457-mm\) figure is  
based on a parapet height of at least 30 inches \(762 mm\).  
As stated in the code, the 30-inch \(762-mm\) requirement is measured from the point where  
the roof surface and wall intersect. Therefore, when a cricket is installed adjacent to the parapet,  
the 30-inch \(762-mm\) dimension would be taken from the top of the cricket.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIn those cases where the roof slopes upward away from the parapet and slopes greater than 2  
units vertical in 12 units horizontal \(16.7-percent slope\), the parapet is required to extend to the  
same height as any portion of the roof that is within the distance where protection of openings in  
the exterior wall would be required. However, in no case shall the height of the parapet be less  
than 30 inches \(762 mm\). See Figure 705-18 for an illustration of this requirement.  
Figure 705-18 Parapet requirements.  
Section 706 Fire Walls  
Section 706 provides the technical details of how fire walls are to be constructed. The IBC  
permits fire walls to be installed within a building, thereby creating one or more smaller area  
buildings. It further selectively recognizes that fire walls can be used for other purposes, such as  
where fire areas are created. The concept is based on buildings on adjoining lots having a  
common party wall or two separate fire-resistance-rated walls located on the lot line. The high  
level of fire-resistance-rated construction between the two buildings, along with other controls, is  
deemed adequate for the protection of one building from its neighboring building and thus  
limiting the size of a potential fire. The use of one or more fire walls within a building is  
optional, based on a decision by the designer. The code never mandates a fire wall be used, but  
rather offers it as an alternative to other mandated provisions. The use of one or more fire walls  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationto create separate buildings is seemingly limited by Section 503.1 to only the following  
applications\:  
1\. Allowable building area. The installation of one or more fire walls reduces the floor area  
in each of the separated buildings. Smaller floor areas can result in a reduction in the type  
of construction for one or more of the smaller buildings.  
2\. Allowable building height. Each building created by the presence of a fire wall can be  
evaluated independently for height purposes.  
3\. Multiple construction types. By separating a structure into separate buildings, they each  
are regulated independently for type of construction. Thus, not all of the structure would  
need to be classified based on the lowest construction type involved.  
The use of a fire wall for purposes other than creating multiple buildings is selectively  
established throughout the IBC, including its use as a horizontal exit separation per Section  
1026.2 or an increase in residential building height as set forth in Sections 510.5 and 510.6.  
Examples of two uses of fire walls are shown in Application Examples 706-1 and 706-2.  
Another application of the fire wall concept is found in Appendix B of the International Fire  
Code® \(IFC®\) relating to fire-flow requirements for buildings. Where structures are separated by  
fire walls without openings, the divided portions may be considered separate fire-flow  
calculation areas. There are numerous other applications for fire walls, all based on the concept  
of reducing hazards due to a significant fire separation.  
Application Example 706-1  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 706-2  
706.1 General. As previously mentioned, one or more fire walls may be constructed in a manner  
such that the code considers the portions separated by the fire walls to be separate buildings.  
Because a fire wall is such a critical element in the prevention of the spread of fire from one  
separated building to another, it is of great importance that the wall be situated and constructed  
properly. It must provide a complete separation. It should be noted that when a wall serves both  
as a fire barrier separating occupancies and a fire wall, the most restrictive requirements of each  
separation shall apply. The code also prohibits any openings in fire walls that are constructed on  
lot lines \(defined as party walls\).  
706.1.1 Party walls. A common wall located on the lot line between two adjacent buildings is  
considered a party wall under this provision of the code. Regulated as a fire wall in accordance  
with the provisions of Section 706, a party wall can be considered in lieu of separate and distinct  
exterior walls adjacent to the lot line. The hazard created by neighboring buildings adjacent to  
each other is further addressed through the requirement that no openings be permitted in a party  
wall. For purposes of this section, and consistent with the general provisions of Section 503.1 for  
structures containing fire walls, separate buildings are created.  
The two exceptions help address situations where the property is divided more for ownership  
purposes \(e.g. taxes, loans, insurance, development\) and being developed jointly versus truly  
having separate properties without any intended relationship. The first exception allows for  
openings in a party wall which typically would not be permitted since the wall is located at a  
property line without any fire separation distance. The second exception allows the overall  
structure to be reviewed as a single building without the need for dividing with a fire wall or  
party wall. In this situation, because the overall structure meets the height and area limitations for  
a single building and that access is for maintenance is provided to both owners to work on either  
side of the lot line, there is no need for dividing the building.  
706.2 Structural stability. The objective of a fire wall is that a complete burnout can occur on  
one side of the wall without any effects of the fire being felt on the opposite side. Furthermore,  
the only damage to the wall will be the effects of fire and the shock of hose-stream application  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationon the fire side. The code is very clear that fire walls should remain in place for the expected  
time period. Therefore, structural failure on either side of the wall shall not cause the collapse of  
the wall, nor can the required fire-resistance rating be diminished. In addition, structural  
members \(especially members that conduct heat\) that penetrate fire walls could limit their  
effectiveness and do not comply with this provision. Any structural member that passes through  
a fire wall could also adversely affect the integrity of the required fire-resistance-rated  
construction.  
The intent of this section can be partially traced back to Section 101.3, which states that one  
of the goals of the code is to provide safety to fire fighters and emergency responders during  
emergency operations. During a fire, a fire wall provides a safe haven on the non-fire side for fire  
fighters to stage and fight a fire. It is critical that the fire wall does not pose a threat of collapse to  
the fire department personnel. This is more easily achieved where the fire wall is a nonbearing  
wall and is not penetrated by load-bearing elements. However, where a fire wall is proposed as a  
bearing wall, the building official should ensure that those structural members that frame into the  
wall will not cause the premature collapse of the fire wall prior to the hourly rating established  
for the wall. The structural engineer of record should provide evidence to this fact. If all  
structural elements framing into the fire wall, as well as their supporting members, have the same  
fire-resistance rating as the fire wall, it is reasonable to assume that the intent of the provision  
has been met.  
As an option to a single fire wall, the code permits the use of a double fire wall if designed  
and constructed in accordance with NFPA 221. Double fire walls are simply two back-to-back  
walls, each having an established fire-resistance rating. While acceptable for use in a new  
structure, double fire walls are most advantageous where an addition is being constructed  
adjacent to an existing building and the intent is to regulate the addition as a separate building  
under the fire wall provisions. The exterior wall of the existing building, if compliant, can be  
used as one wall of the double wall system, with the new wall of the addition providing the  
second wall.  
Double fire wall assemblies are to comply with the applicable provisions of NFPA 221,  
Standard for High Challenge Fire Walls, Fire Walls, and Fire Barrier Walls. This standard  
addresses a number of criteria for double fire walls, including fire-resistance rating, connections,  
and structural support. In order to meet the minimum fire-resistance rating for a fire wall as set  
forth in IBC Table 706.4, each individual wall of a double fire wall assembly is permitted to be  
reduced to 1 hour less than the minimum required rating for a single fire wall. For example,  
where IBC Table 706.4 requires the use of a minimum 3-hour fire wall, two minimum 2-hour  
fire-resistance-rated \(double\) fire walls are required. Similarly, two 3-hour fire walls in a double  
wall system can be considered as a single 4-hour fire wall, and two 1-hour fire walls used as a  
double wall qualify as a single 2-hour fire wall.  
The intended goal of fire wall construction is to allow collapse of a building on either side of  
the fire wall while maintaining an acceptable level of fire separation. Therefore, other than the  
sheathing allowed by the exception, the only connection permitted by NFPA 221 between the  
two walls that make up the double fire wall is the flashing, if provided. Illustrated in the  
explanatory material to the standard, the choice of flashing methods must provide for separate  
flashing sections in order to maintain a complete physical separation between the walls. Each  
individual wall of the double wall assembly must be supported laterally without any assistance  
from the adjoining building. In addition, a minimum clear space between the two walls is  
recommended by NFPA 221 in order to allow for thermal expansion between unprotected  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstructural framework, where applicable, and the wall assemblies that make up the double fire  
wall. The intent of the exception is to allow the sheathing used for floor or roof diaphragms in  
the higher seismic zones to continue through the walls. Therefore, allowing the separate  
buildings to be stronger and react together in a seismic event.  
NFPA 221 can also be used as the design standard for the construction of other types of fire  
walls. Two other high challenge \(HC\) fire walls are addressed in NFPA 221, cantilevered HC  
fire walls and tied HC fire walls. Cantilevered HC fire walls must be fully self-supported and  
nonbearing, with no connections to the buildings on either side other than flashing. Tied HC fire  
walls are limited to one-story conditions and supported laterally by the building framework with  
flexible anchors. Centered on a single column line or between a double column line, a tied HC  
fire wall shall be constructed such that the framework on each side of the wall shall be  
continuous or tied together through the wall.  
706.3 Materials. In buildings of other than Type V construction, fire walls shall be constructed  
of noncombustible materials. The high degree of protection expected from a fire wall mandates  
that noncombustible construction be used for all but the lowest type of construction.  
706.4 Fire-resistance rating. It is obvious that a fire wall performs the very important function  
of acting as a barrier to fire spread so that a fire on one side of the wall will not be transmitted to  
the other. On this basis, the fire wall must have a fire-resistance rating commensurate with the  
occupancy and type of construction of which it is constructed. The IBC provides that fire walls  
be of 2-hour, 3-hour, or 4-hour fire-resistance-rated construction as specified in Table 706.4.  
Where the type of construction and/or occupancy group that occurs on one side of a fire wall is  
inconsistent with that on the other side, the more restrictive fire-resistance rating set forth in  
Table 706.4 shall apply. See Figure 706-1. Permitted openings in fire walls are addressed in  
Section 706.8.  
Figure 706-1 Fire-resistance rating.  
706.5 Horizontal continuity. A fire wall must not only separate the interior portions of the  
building but must also extend at least 18 inches \(457 mm\) beyond the exterior surfaces of  
exterior walls. See Figure 706-2. A number of exceptions permit the fire wall to terminate at the  
interior surface of the exterior finish material, with Exception 1 illustrated in Figure 706-3.  
Where combustible sheathing or siding materials are used, the wall must be protected for at least  
4 feet \(1,220 mm\) on both sides of the fire wall by minimum 1-hour construction with any  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationopenings protected at least 45 minutes. If the sheathing, siding, or other finish material is  
noncombustible, such noncombustible materials shall extend at least 4 feet \(1,220 mm\) on both  
sides of the fire wall; however, unlike the previous exception, no opening protection is required.  
As an option, where the separate buildings created by the fire wall are sprinklered, the fire wall  
may simply terminate at the interior surface of noncombustible exterior sheathing.  
Figure 706-2 Horizontal continuity.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 706-3 Horizontal continuity.  
706.5.1 Exterior walls. Where a fire wall creating separate buildings intersects with the exterior  
wall, there is the potential for direct fire exposure between the buildings at the exterior. Unless  
the intersection of the exterior wall and the fire wall forms an angle of at least 180 degrees \(3.14  
rad\), such as a straight exterior wall with no offsets, a condition occurs similar to that of two  
buildings located on the same site. The proximity of the two buildings may be such that the  
distance between them would allow for direct fire or substantial radiant heat to be transferred  
from one building to the other. This condition is also possible where the two buildings on the lot  
are portions of a larger structure with fire wall separations.  
Where the fire wall intersects the exterior wall to form an angle of less than 180 degrees \(3.14  
rad\), the exterior wall for at least 4 feet \(1,220 mm\) on both sides of the fire wall shall be of  
minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction, and all openings within the 4-foot \(1220-  
mm\) portions of the exterior wall are to be protected with 45-minute fire assemblies. See Figure  
706-4\. As an option, an imaginary lot line may be assumed between the two buildings created by  
the fire wall and the exterior wall, and opening protection would be based on the fire separation  
distances to the imaginary lot line. This method is consistent with the provisions of Section 705.3  
for addressing two buildings on the same lot. An example is shown in Figure 706-5.  
706.5.2 Horizontal projecting elements. Under the conditions where a horizontal projecting  
element such as a roof overhang or balcony is located within 4 feet \(1,220 mm\) of a fire wall, the  
wall must extend to the outer edge of the projection. This general requirement provides for a  
complete separation by totally isolating all building elements, including projections, on either  
side of a fire-resistance-rated wall. However, such a condition is typically not visually pleasing.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTherefore, the code indicates the fire wall is not required to extend to the leading edge of the  
projecting element if constructed in compliance with one of three exceptions. The protection  
must extend through the projecting element unless the projection has no concealed spaces.  
Where the projecting element is combustible and has concealed spaces, the fire wall shall extend  
through the concealed area, whereas in noncombustible construction, the extension need only be  
1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction. Under all of the exceptions, the exterior wall behind  
and below the projecting element is to be of 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction for a  
distance not less than the depth of the projecting element on both sides of the wall. All openings  
within the rated exterior wall are to be protected by fire assemblies having a minimum fire-  
protection rating of 45 minutes. Figure 706-6 depicts these various conditions addressed in the  
exceptions.  
Figure 706-4 Fire wall intersection with exterior walls.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 706-5 Imaginary lot line at extension of fire wall.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 706-6 Horizontal projecting elements.  
706.6 Vertical continuity. Having established the intent of the IBC that fire walls prevent the  
spread of fire around or through the wall to the other side, the IBC further ensures the separate  
building concept by specifying that the wall shall extend continuously from the foundation to  
\(and through\) the roof to a point 30 inches \(762 mm\) or more above the roof. The 30-inch \(762-  
mm\) parapet prevents the spread of fire along the roof surface from the fire side to the other side  
of the wall.  
Several exceptions, some of which are illustrated in Figure 706-7, allow the fire wall to  
terminate at the underside of the roof sheathing, deck, or slab, rather than terminate in a parapet.  
The basis for such exceptions includes\:  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 706-7 Termination of fire walls.  
1\. Equivalent protection being provided by an alternative construction method;  
2\. Aesthetic considerations, as parapets disrupt the appearance of the roof; or  
3\. A combination of the two previous reasons.  
It is emphasized that the term fire wall also limits its use to vertical walls. Therefore, there can  
be no horizontal offsets nor can the plan view of the wall change from level to level. See Figure  
706-8.  
706.6.1 Stepped buildings. Quite often, a fire wall is provided at a point in the building where  
the roof changes height. Under such conditions, the fire wall must extend above the lower roof  
for a minimum height of 30 inches \(762 mm\). In addition, the exterior wall shall be of at least 1-  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationhour fire-resistance-rated construction for a total height of 15 feet \(4,572 mm\) above the lower  
roof. The exterior wall shall be of fire-resistance-rated construction from both sides. Any  
opening that is located in the lower 30 inches \(762 mm\) of the wall shall be regulated based on  
the rating of the fire wall. Openings above the 30-inch \(762-mm\) height, but not located above a  
height of 15 feet \(4,572 mm\), shall have a minimum fire-protection rating of 45 minutes. An  
illustration of this provision is depicted in Figure 706-9.  
Figure 706-8 Fire wall vertical community.  
An alternative is described in the exception that allows the fire wall to terminate at the  
underside of the roof sheathing, deck, or slab of the lower roof. It is very similar to Exception 2  
in Section 706.6. Because the greatest exposure occurs from a fire penetrating the lower roof and  
exposing the adjacent exterior portion of the fire wall, the code mandates that all protection be  
applied to the roof assembly of the lower roof. As shown in Figure 706-10, the lower roof  
assembly within 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) of the wall shall be of minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated  
construction. In addition, no openings are permitted in the lower roof within 10 feet \(3,048 mm\)  
of the fire wall.

@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 707 Fire Barriers  
A common function of a fire barrier is to totally isolate one portion of a floor level from another  
through the use of fire-resistance-rated walls and opening protectives. Fire-resistance-rated  
horizontal assemblies are also often used in conjunction with fire barriers in multistory buildings  
in order to isolate areas vertically. This section identifies the different uses for fire barriers, as  
well as the method in which fire barriers are to be constructed.  
707.3 Fire-resistance rating. A fire barrier shall be used to provide the necessary separation for  
the following building elements or conditions\:  
1\. Shaft enclosure. The minimum required degree of fire-resistance for fire barriers used to  
create a shaft enclosure is based primarily on the number of stories connected by the  
enclosure. A minimum 2-hour fire-resistance rating is mandated where four or more  
stories are connected, with only a 1-hour rating required where connecting only two or  
three stories. In all cases, the rating of a shaft enclosure must equal or exceed that of the  
floor assembly that is penetrated by the enclosure but need not exceed 2 hours.  
2\. Interior exit stairway construction. The separation between an interior exit stairway \(stair  
enclosure\) and the remainder of the building shall be accomplished with fire barriers  
having either a 1- or 2-hour fire-resistance rating, as required by Section 1023.2. Similar  
enclosures are required for interior exit ramps.  
3\. Exit access stairway enclosures. Where exit access stairways are required to be enclosed  
by Sections 1019.3 and 713.4, the enclosure shall include the use of fire barriers.  
4\. Exit passageway. An exit passageway must be isolated from the remainder of the building  
by minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated fire-barrier walls. Where horizontal enclosure is  
also required, minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated horizontal assemblies must also be  
used to totally isolate the exit passageway. Where an exit passageway is a continuation of  
an interior exit stairway, it must, at a minimum, maintain the fire-resistance rating of the  
stairway enclosure.  
5\. Horizontal exit. A minimum 2-hour fire-resistance-rated fire barrier may be used to create  
a horizontal exit when in compliance with all of the other provisions of Section 1026. The  
fire barrier creates protected compartments where occupants of the building can travel to  
escape the fire incident.  
6\. Atrium. Unless a complying glazing system or ¾-hour glass block construction is used,  
minimum 1-hour fire barriers are required when isolating an atrium from surrounding  
spaces.  
7\. Incidental uses. Table 509.1 indicates the required separation or protection required for  
special hazard areas such as waste and linen collection rooms, laboratories, and furnace  
rooms. Where a 1- or 2-hour fire-resistance-rated wall is required, it shall be a fire barrier.  
8\. Control areas. Table 414.2.2 identifies the minimum required fire-resistance rating for fire  
barriers used to create control areas in buildings housing hazardous materials. A minimum  
rating of 1 hour is mandated for separating control areas located on the first three floor  
levels above grade plane, whereas minimum 2-hour fire barriers are required for control  
area separations on all floor levels above the third level.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation9\. 10. Separated occupancies. The separation of dissimilar occupancies in the same building is  
accomplished by fire barriers. Table 508.4 is used to determine the required fire-resistance  
rating of the required fire barriers, ranging from 1 hour through 4 hours.  
Fire areas. Where a building is divided into fire areas by fire barriers in order to not  
exceed the limitations of Section 903.2 for requiring an automatic sprinkler system, the  
minimum required fire-resistance ratings of the fire barriers are set forth in Table  
707.3.10\. Ranging from a minimum of 1 hour to a maximum of 4 hours, the fire-resistive  
requirements are based solely on the occupancy classification of the fire areas. The  
provisions are applicable to both single-occupancy and mixed-occupancy conditions. See  
the discussion on Section 901.7 for further information.  
Note also that fire barriers are required as separation elements in other miscellaneous  
locations identified by the code, such as stage accessory areas \(Section 410.4\) and flammable  
finish spray rooms \(Section 416.2\). Throughout the code, references are made to fire barriers as  
the method of providing the appropriate fire-resistance-rated separation intended. In addition,  
many of the other International Codes® also address the use of fire barriers to create protected  
areas.  
707.5 Continuity. Fire barriers must begin at the floor and extend uninterrupted to the floor or  
roof deck above. Where there is a concealed space above a ceiling, the fire barrier must continue  
through the above-ceiling space. See Figure 707-1. Fireblocking, required only in combustible  
construction, must be installed at every floor level if the fire barrier contains hollow vertical  
spaces. The intent of a fire barrier is to provide a continuous separation so as to completely  
isolate one area from another. As with many other fire-resistance-rated elements, the supporting  
construction must be of an equivalent rating to the fire barrier supported. A reduction relates to  
1-hour incidental use separations in nonrated construction.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 707-1 Fire barrier continuity.  
707.6 Openings. The provisions of Section 716 regulate the protection of openings in fire  
barriers. The fire-protection ratings mandated for fire-barrier openings in Tables 716.1\(2\) and  
716.1\(3\) vary depending on the fire-resistance rating of the fire barrier as well as its purpose. The  
required rating may be as little as ¾ hour to as much as 3 hours.  
707.9 Voids at intersections. It is not uncommon for a void to be created at the joint between a  
fire barrier and the floor or roof deck above. Where the joint occurs at a fire-resistance-rated  
floor or roof deck, Sections 707.8 and 715.3 mandate that the joint be protected by an approved  
fire-resistant joint system. Protecting the gap or void around an assembly is also important where  
the joint occurs between a fire barrier and a non-fire-rated floor or roof. Section 707.9 is only  
intended to address those situations where the roof assembly or exterior wall is not fire-resistance  
rated. The void need only be filled with an approved material that is securely installed and  
capable of retarding the passage of fire and hot gases.  
Section 708 Fire Partitions  
This section regulates the design and construction of fire partitions installed in the listed  
locations. The IBC identifies eight locations where fire partitions are required or used within the  
code.  
708.3 Fire-resistance rating. The minimum fire-resistance rating of fire partitions is to be 1  
hour, unless a reduction is permitted by one of two exceptions. Exception 1 refers to Table  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1020.2, which identifies the required fire-resistance rating of a corridor based on three factors—  
the occupancy classification of the area served by the corridor, the occupant load the corridor  
serves, and whether or not the building is sprinklered. Where conditions warrant, the table  
indicates that the corridor needs only a ½-hour fire-resistance rating. If no fire-resistance rating is  
mandated, fire partitions are not required and none of the provisions of Section 708 are  
applicable. The second exception applies to walls separating dwelling units and sleeping units in  
buildings of nonrated construction. The presence of an automatic sprinkler system complying  
with NFPA 13 reduces the required fire-partition rating to 30 minutes. It should be noted that the  
exception does not permit this reduction where an NFPA 13R system is installed.  
708.4 Continuity. Consistent with the required continuity of fire barriers, the general  
requirement for fire partitions is that they must extend from the floor to the floor or roof deck  
above. However, unlike the provisions for fire barriers, an alternative construction method is  
permitted where fire partitions may terminate short of the floor or roof deck under various  
conditions. Where a fire-resistance-rated floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling with an equivalent fire-  
resistance rating is provided, a fire partition need only extend to, and be securely attached to, the  
ceiling membrane. For an example of this provision as it relates to corridor construction, refer to  
Figure 708-1. Under this condition in combustible construction, fireblocking or draftstopping  
must be installed at the partition line in the concealed space above the ceiling. In general, any  
supporting construction is to be at least 1-hour fire-resistance rated, however, this support  
requirement is waived for many fire partitions in buildings of Type IIB, IIIB, and VB  
construction.  
The following exceptions modify the continuity provisions of this section\:  
1\. Where a crawl space exists below a floor assembly of at least 1-hour fire-resistance-rated  
construction, the fire partition does not need to extend into the underfloor space. See  
Figure 708-2.  
2\. The arrangement shown in Figure 708-3 would meet the code requirement for adequately  
enclosing a corridor based on applying item 2.1. The corridor walls are protected on the  
room-side of the occupied use spaces by a fire-resistance-rated membrane extending from  
the floor to the floor or roof above. In this case, the ceiling over the corridor may be  
considered as completing the enclosure provided the ceiling membrane is equivalent to  
the wall membrane.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 708-1 Corridor fire partitions.  
Figure 708-2 Fire partitions above a crawl space.  
3\. The code provides that the corridor ceiling may be of the same construction as permitted  
for corridor walls as shown in Figure 708-4. In all probability, typical wall construction  
might not pass the 1-hour test when tested in a horizontal position. However, this  
arrangement, generally referred to as tunnel construction, is considered to be adequate  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprotection for the corridor separating it from the spaces above.  
Figure 708-3 Corridor construction.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 708-4 Tunnel corridor.  
By establishing various methods for the enclosure of fire-resistance-rated corridors,  
the code is essentially attempting to get a minimal separation between the exit corridor  
and the occupied-use spaces. Any arrangement of the 1-hour fire-resistance-rated  
construction that effectively intervenes between these use spaces and the corridor would  
satisfy this requirement.  
4\. In covered or open mall buildings, fire partitions separating tenant spaces may terminate  
at the underside of a ceiling, even if the ceiling is not part of a fire-resistance-rated  
assembly. No type of extension of the fire partition is required by this section for attics  
and similar spaces above the ceiling.  
Section 708.4 and its subsections are split up so that the general provisions of 708.4 address  
the continuity of fire partitions in regard to their enclosure limits. Section 708.4.1 deals with the  
construction components supporting fire partitions, while 708.4.2 addresses the fireblocking and  
draftstopping of fire partitions of combustible construction.  
In combustible construction where a fire partition does not extend to the underside of the floor  
or roof sheathing as addressed in item 1 of Section 708.4, the provisions of 708.4.2 will provide  
a number of options to prevent a fire from passing over the fire partition within the concealed  
space.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationException 4 is for use in attic areas of Group R-2 occupancies less than five stories in height  
above grade plane and allows the draftstopping or fireblocking required by this section to be  
omitted where the attic area is subdivided by draftstopping into areas not exceeding two dwelling  
units or 3,000 square feet \(279 m2\), whichever is less.  
Exception 1 applies in combustible buildings where the fire partitions stop at the fire-  
resistance-rated ceiling membrane. Fireblocking or draftstopping is not required at the partition  
line if the building is fully sprinklered. Under this exception, sprinklers must be installed in the  
combustible floor/ceiling and roof/ceiling spaces. Exceptions in Sections 718.3 and 718.4  
provide the same intent that the sprinkler protection is provided within the concealed space.  
Section 709 Smoke Barriers  
Smoke barriers, both vertical and horizontal, are occasionally mandated by the code to resist the  
passage of smoke from one area to another. The use of smoke barriers is assigned to those  
portions of buildings intended to provide refuge to occupants who may not be able to exit the  
building in a timely manner. In such cases, relocation, rather than evacuation, is the initial  
approach to an emergency condition. For example, smoke barriers are used in areas of refuge  
\(Section 1009.6.4\), in smoke-control systems \(Section 909.5\), in Group I-3 occupancies \(Section  
408.6\), and in various other building areas where smoke transmission is a concern. By far the  
most common use of smoke barriers is in Group I-2 occupancies, where they are used to create  
smoke compartments \(Section 407.5\). Smoke barriers must not only resist the passage of smoke,  
they must also be of minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction. In Group I-3  
occupancies, an exception permits the use of 0.10-inch-thick \(2.5-mm\) steel in lieu of 1-hour  
construction.  
The key to the construction of a smoke barrier is that all avenues for smoke to travel outside  
of the compartment created by the smoke barrier are eliminated. This requires the membrane to  
be continuous from outside wall to outside wall or to another smoke barrier where creating  
smoke compartments, and from the floor slab to the floor or roof deck above. The smoke barriers  
must continue through all concealed spaces, such as those above ceilings, unless the ceilings  
provide the necessary resistance against fire and smoke passage. In buildings of rated  
construction, all smoke barriers shall be supported by construction consistent with the fire-  
resistance rating of the wall or floor supported.  
All door openings in smoke barriers are to be protected with assemblies having a minimum  
fire-protection rating of 20 minutes, per Table 716.1\(2\). In cross-corridor situations in Group I-2  
occupancies, the code mandates a pair of opposite-swinging doors installed without a center  
mullion. Such doors shall be provided with an approved vision panel; be close fitting; have no  
louvers or grilles; and undercuts are limited to ¾ inch. Although positive latching is not required,  
the doors are to have head and jamb stops, astragals, or rabbets at meeting edges, and automatic-  
closing devices.  
Smoke barriers, like smoke partitions regulated by Section 710, are only mandated where  
specifically identified or referenced by the code. As an example, Section 509.4.2 requires the use  
of “construction capable of resisting the passage of smoke” as a potential physical separation for  
incidental uses. Thus, only construction that will perform the intended function is required, and  
not necessarily a smoke barrier or smoke partition.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 710 Smoke Partitions  
The purpose of a smoke partition is limited to the concerns of smoke movement under fire  
conditions, with no intent to regulate for the resistance to flame and heat.  
Smoke partitions are mandated by the code in limited applications, most commonly in the  
construction of corridors in Group I-2 occupancies. As such, corridors in hospitals, nursing  
homes, and similar Group I-2 occupancies are regulated by the provisions of both Sections 710  
and 407.3. It requires a comparison of the two sections to determine the requirements for  
corridor systems, particularly corridor doors and air openings.  
710.5 Openings. This section generally prohibits the installation of louvers in doors in smoke  
partitions. This is consistent with the provisions of Section 407.3.1 mandating an effective  
barrier against the transfer of smoke. An exception will permit louvers or an undercut to provide  
exhaust systems with make-up air from non-rated corridors. The provisions of this section also  
require that doors in smoke partitions be tested in accordance with UL 1784 and be self-closing  
or automatic closing, but only where required elsewhere in the code. A review of Section 407.3.1  
regulating corridor doors in Group I-2 occupancies does not require the UL test, and it  
specifically states that self-closing or automatic-closing devices are not required. In this case, the  
provisions in Section 407.3.1 take precedence as a specific requirement \(see Section 102.1\).  
710.8 Ducts and air transfer openings. The provisions of both Sections 717.5.7 and 710.8  
mandate the need for smoke dampers in air transfer openings that occur in smoke partitions.  
Smoke dampers are not required at duct penetrations of smoke partitions, but only at unducted  
air openings.  
Section 711 Floor and Roof Assemblies  
This section is applicable where floor and roof assemblies are required to have a fire-resistance  
rating. This will occur where the type of construction mandates protected floor and roof  
assemblies, such as in Type I, IIA, IIIA, and VA construction, and where the floor assembly is  
used to separate occupancies or create separate fire areas. For example, in a building of Type IIA  
construction, Table 601 requires minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated floor construction. As  
another example, where the floor separates a Group A-2 occupancy from a Group B, Table 508.4  
addressing separated occupancies mandates a 1- or 2-hour separation.  
As referenced in Section 420.3, complementary to the provisions of Section 708 for fire  
partitions, floor assemblies separating dwelling units or sleeping units are required to be of at  
least 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction. The exception to Section 711.2.4.3 reduces the  
required level of protection for the floor assembly to ½ hour in buildings of Type IIB, IIIB, or  
VB construction, provided the building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system.  
711.2.3 Supporting construction. As a general rule, horizontal assemblies must be supported by  
structural members or walls having at least the equivalent fire rating as that for the horizontal  
assembly. For example, in a Type IIA school building of two stories where the floor construction  
is required to be a 2-hour fire-resistance-rated assembly in order to separate fire areas, any walls  
or structural members in the first story supporting the second floor would be required to also be  
of 2-hour fire-resistance-rated construction. This would be the case even though the building  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationgenerally is required to be only of 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction. Obviously, if the  
horizontal assembly is not supported by equivalent fire-resistance-rated construction, the intent  
and function of the separation are negated if its supports fail prematurely.  
711.2.5 Ceiling panels. The protection of a ceiling membrane also includes the adequacy of the  
panelized ceiling system to withstand forces generated by a fire and other forces that may try to  
displace the panels. These forces can generate positive pressures in a fire compartment that need  
to be counteracted. As a result, lay-in ceiling panels that provide a portion of the fire resistance  
of the floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assembly should be capable of resisting this upward or  
positive pressure so that the panels stay in position and continue to maintain the integrity of the  
system. The code defines the pressure to be resisted as 1 pound per square foot \(48 Pa\).  
711.2.6 Unusable space. Figure 711-1 illustrates how this provision is applied in regard to  
unusable spaces such as crawl spaces and attics. For 1-hour fire-resistance-rated floor  
construction over a crawl space, the ceiling membrane is not necessary in the crawl-space area.  
Similarly, in 1-hour fire-resistance-rated roof construction, the floor membrane is not required in  
the attic. Note that the elimination of the membranes in the attic and crawl space is only  
applicable where the required rating of the floor or roof assembly is a maximum of 1 hour.  
Figure 711-1 Omission of ceiling or floor membrane.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 712 Vertical Openings  
It is well known that one of the primary means for the spread of fire in multistory buildings,  
particularly older buildings, has been the transmission of hot gases and fire upward through  
unprotected or improperly protected vertical openings. The primary cause of death in the hotel  
portion of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, as a result of the fire in November  
1980, was the upward transmission of smoke through inadequately protected elevator shafts, stair  
shafts, and heating and ventilating shafts. It is because of this potential for fire spread vertically  
through buildings that this section requires that vertical openings be appropriately regulated. This  
section identifies the following applications for addressing vertical openings\:  
1\. The use of a shaft enclosure to protect vertical openings is a time-honored method  
recognizing that the fire-resistance-rated enclosure of a floor opening provides a near  
equivalency to a floor with no openings. The shaft enclosure is intended to replace the  
floor construction with an equal or better degree of fire resistance. A shaft enclosure is  
often used for vertical opening protection simply because none of the other applications  
listed in this section are applicable. The specific requirements for shaft enclosures are set  
forth in Section 713.  
2\. 3. 4. 5. Within individual dwelling units, unconcealed vertical openings are permitted provided  
they connect no more than four stories. The allowance for openings is intended to apply to  
units that are open vertically with unenclosed stairways and floor spaces, such as lofts.  
Concealed spaces used for the installation of ducts, piping, and conduit between stories do  
not fall under this allowance.  
In fully sprinklered buildings, the vertical openings created for an escalator may be  
protected by one of the following two methods\:  
3.1\. By limiting the size of the openings, along with the installation of draft curtains  
and closely spaced sprinklers, the code assumes that the vertical openings in  
sprinklered buildings do not present an untenable condition. The purpose of the  
required draft curtain is to trap heat so that the sprinklers will operate and cool the  
gases that are rising. The curtain is not a fabric; it is constructed of materials  
consistent with the type of construction of the building. In other than mercantile and  
business occupancies, the use of this method is limited to openings connecting four or  
fewer stories.  
3.2\. Approved power-operated automatic shutters may also be used to cut off the  
openings between floors. Required to have a minimum fire-resistance rating of at  
least 1½ hours, the shutters shall close immediately upon activation of a smoke  
detector. Obviously, operation of an escalator must stop once the shutter begins to  
close.  
Penetrations of cables, conduit, tubing, piping, vents, and similar penetrating items are  
permitted provided the penetrations are protected in conformance with the provisions of  
Section 714. The allowance for vent penetrations only applies to plumbing vents and  
those vents that convey products of combustion as defined in the International  
Mechanical Code® \(IMC®\) and is not intended to apply to exhaust ducts.  
Joints protected by a fire-resistant joint system, like other building elements protected by  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation6\. 7. 8. 9. 10. approved methods, do not create any additional hazard that needs to be addressed.  
As an alternative to the use of shaft enclosures for ducts penetrating floor systems, the  
provisions of Section 717.6 also regulate the penetration of ducts through horizontal  
assemblies. If the provisions of Section 717.6 do not mandate the installation of a damper,  
the provisions of Sections 717.1.2 and Sections 714.5 through 714.6.2 are applicable to  
the penetration of a horizontal assembly without a shaft. Where Section 717.6 mandates a  
damper in the duct or air transfer opening, then Section 717 applies.  
Atriums are intended to be open vertically. Where such special building features are  
designed and constructed in compliance with their own unique provisions, other means of  
vertical opening protection are not required. The use of an atrium is a design option,  
voluntarily applied by the designer, and thus typically provided as an alternative to a shaft  
enclosure. For further information, see the discussion of Section 404.  
It is a widely held belief that the allowance for atriums is also applicable to covered  
mall buildings that meet the special requirements of Section 402. However, there is no  
specific provision in Section 712 that specifically addresses multistory covered mall  
buildings. Vertical openings in the mall portion of the building could be regulated under  
the provisions of Sections 712.1.7, 712.1.9, and 712.1.12, but a general allowance for the  
entire building is not available.  
In most occupancies, the use of Section 712.1.7 is limited to those buildings where the  
floor openings connect three or more stories. In other than Groups I-2 and I-3  
occupancies, where a floor opening connects only two stories, Sections 712.1.9 and  
712.1.12 are applied.  
A masonry chimney extending through one or more floor levels is permitted where the  
annular space around the chimney is protected in the manner specified by Section 718.2.5.  
This provision permits two adjacent stories to intercommunicate with each other without  
protection of the openings between the two stories, except in the case of Group I-2 and I-3  
occupancies. As long as these intercommunicating openings serve only the one adjacent  
floor, no protection is required. This provision is commonly used where multistory office  
buildings have a lobby that extends up through the second story so that individuals on the  
second floor may look down over a guard into the lobby below. It is important that the  
unprotected floor opening be appropriately separated from floor openings serving other  
floors.  
In addition, the opening between floor levels cannot be concealed within the  
construction of a wall or floor-ceiling assembly. The limitation on concealment is  
intended to prevent unprotected openings that are completely enclosed by walls,  
partitions, chases, or floor/ceiling assemblies. Where the openings are concealed in this  
manner, they permit a fire within the concealed space to burn undetected and distribute  
products of combustion to the upper floor.  
Parking garages have a number of provisions related to openings in a horizontal  
assembly. These include\:  
10.1 Automobile ramps in both enclosed and open parking garages, when in  
compliance with the provisions of Sections 406.5 and 406.6, respectively, are  
permitted. Because the nature of these uses makes it impractical for enclosures, other  
safeguards are provided by the code in Section 406.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation11\. 12. 13. 14. 15. 10.2 The enclosure of elevator hoistways in parking garages is not required for those  
hoistways that only serve the parking garage.  
10.3 Vertical opening protection is not mandated for the enclosure of mechanical  
exhaust and supply duct systems in both types of garage facilities. The protection of  
vertical openings provided to accommodate elevators, as addressed in Section  
712.1.10.2, as well as exhaust ducts and supply ducts, is unnecessary since the vehicle  
ramps of parking garages are permitted to be open at all levels.  
By definition, a complying mezzanine is intended to be open into the room below. As  
such, unenclosed floor openings between the mezzanine and the lower floor are permitted.  
Exit access stairways in compliance with the exceptions listed in Section 1019.3 do not  
require enclosure. For example, under exception 1, stairways may be unenclosed provided  
they connect no more than two adjacent stories and are not open to any other stories in the  
building.  
Floor fire door assemblies and ceiling access doors are permitted to protect vertical  
openings where tested in accordance with the applicable standard.  
In a Group I-3 occupancy, openings in floors within a housing unit are permitted without  
a shaft enclosure provided four specific conditions established in Section 408.5 are met.  
The installation of unprotected skylights and other penetrations through the roof deck of  
a fire-resistance-rated roof assembly is permitted, provided the structural integrity of the  
roof construction is maintained.  
16\. Throughout the code, there may be other allowances for floor penetrations or openings  
that are adequately regulated as vertical openings. Where permitted, these openings must  
comply with the specifics of their use.  
Section 713 Shaft Enclosures  
The use of a shaft enclosure has long been an acceptable means to protect vertical openings  
between stories. The enclosure construction is considered to be equivalent to the floor system  
and thus is permitted to protect any opening that occurs. Although using a shaft enclosure is just  
one of many applications listed in Section 712.1 for addressing vertical openings, its use is very  
common, particularly in buildings with a substantial number of stories. In some buildings, the  
use of a shaft enclosure is the only viable application available.  
713.4 Fire-resistance rating. To provide an acceptable level of protection for vertical openings  
between floors, this section mandates that all shaft enclosures have a fire-resistance rating at least  
equivalent to the rating of the floor being penetrated, but never less than 1 hour. Therefore, in  
Type I construction, or where the shaft enclosure connects four or more stories, a minimum 2-  
hour enclosure is mandated. A shaft enclosure is never required to have a higher fire-resistance  
rating than 2 hours.  
713.5 Continuity. Shaft enclosures are required to be constructed as fire barriers, extending from  
the top of the floor/ceiling assembly below to the underside of the floor or roof deck above,  
except as permitted by Sections 713.11 and 713.12. It is important that the walls continue  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthrough any concealed spaces such as the area above a ceiling, and that any hollow vertical  
spaces within the shaft wall be fireblocked at each floor level in buildings of combustible  
construction. In addition, the supporting elements of any shaft enclosure construction must be of  
fire-resistance-rated construction equivalent to that of the shaft construction. The enclosure, fire-  
resistance-wise, should be continuous from the lowest floor opening through to its termination.  
713.6 Exterior walls. Unless required to be fire-resistance rated because of the proximity to an  
exterior exit balcony, interior exit stairway or ramp, or an exterior exit stairway or ramp, the  
exterior walls of a shaft enclosure need only be protected because of their location on the lot as  
regulated by Section 705.  
713.11 Enclosure at the bottom. Many shafts do not extend to the bottom of the building or  
structure. Therefore, it is necessary to provide an approved method for maintaining the integrity  
of the shaft enclosure at its lowest point. This section identifies three methods for enclosing the  
bottom of a shaft enclosure. First, the shaft can be enclosed with fire-resistance-rated  
construction equivalent to that for the lowest floor penetrated, with a minimum rating consistent  
with that of the shaft enclosure. Second, a termination room related to the purpose of the shaft  
can be considered to be the enclosure at the bottom, provided the room is separated from the  
remainder of the building with fire-resistance-rated construction and opening protectives  
equivalent to those of the shaft enclosure. Third, approved horizontal fire dampers can be used to  
protect openings at the lowest floor level in lieu of the enclosure at the bottom of the shaft  
enclosure. See Figures 713-1a, b, and c.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 713-1 Enclosure at shaft bottom.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 713-2 Vertical shafts—bottom enclosure.  
The first of the three exceptions eliminates the fire-resistance-rated room separation where  
there are no other openings into the shaft enclosure other than at the bottom. All portions of the  
enclosure bottom must be closed off except for the penetrating items, unless the room is provided  
with an automatic fire-suppression system. An example of this concept would be a vent  
enclosure. The second exception requires that a shaft enclosure containing a waste or linen chute  
be used for no other purpose and shall end in a termination room per Section 713.13.4. Exception  
3 applies where the shaft enclosure contains no combustible materials and there are no openings  
to other stories. In this situation, there is no need for either the fire-resistance-rated room  
separation or protection at the bottom of the enclosure. An example would be a light well that  
extends through several floor levels to the roof, as illustrated in Figure 713-2. It would be  
considered an extension of the floor below the level of the floor opening.  
713.12 Enclosure at the top. Most shafts extend to or through the roof deck at the exterior,  
where there is no requirement to maintain the fire-resistance rating of the shaft enclosure  
construction. However, where the enclosure does not extend to the roof, the top of the shaft must  
be enclosed. When terminating within the building, the required fire-resistance rating of the shaft  
lid shall be equivalent to the rating of the topmost floor penetrated by the shaft, but in no case  
less than the fire-resistance rating required for the shaft. See Figure 713-3 for examples that  
illustrate the three upper termination options.  
713.13 Waste, recycle, and linen chutes and incinerator rooms. The requirements of this  
section are intended to further strengthen the shaft-enclosure provisions where chutes and  
discharge rooms for waste, recycle, or linen are constructed. Waste, recycle, and linen areas are  
often poorly maintained, with a greater potential for a fire incident than most other areas of a  
building. Coupled with the shaft conditions that are created by the chutes, these types of areas  
pose hazards that exceed those typically encountered. See Figure 713-4. To further secure the  
intent, Section 903.2.11.2 requires sprinkler protection for the chutes and termination rooms.  
Waste and linen chutes are regulated by both the IBC and Chapter 6 of NFPA 82, Standard on  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIncinerators and Waste and Linen Handling Systems and Equipment. While Section 713.13 and  
the NFPA 82 standard should be viewed as being the “specific” requirements, Section 102.4  
should be reviewed since many of the general shaft provisions of Section 713 will still be  
applicable.

Section 714 Penetrations  
The integrity of fire-resistance-rated horizontal and vertical assemblies is jeopardized where  
penetrations of such assemblies are not properly addressed. Cables, cable trays, conduit, tubing,  
vents, pipes, and similar items are those types of penetrating items regulated by the code. This  
section of the IBC identifies the appropriate materials and methods of construction used to  
protect both membrane penetrations and through penetrations.  
714.1.1 Ducts and air transfer openings. Section 717.5 identifies the various conditions under  
which fire-resistance-rated wall assemblies penetrated by ducts or air transfer openings must be  
provided with fire and/or smoke dampers. There are a limited number of locations where a  
damper is not required, such as that permitted by Exception 3 of Section 717.5.2 for fire barrier  
penetrations and Exception 4 of Section 717.5.4 for fire partitions. See Figure 714-1. In such  
situations, it is necessary that the penetrations be protected in accordance with the appropriate  
provisions of Section 714 in order to maintain the integrity of the fire-resistive assembly.  
714.3 Installation details. As illustrated in Figure 714-2, sleeves used in the process of creating  
a through-penetration of a fire-resistance-rated building element must be properly installed. They  
must be securely fastened to the assembly that is being penetrated. In addition, both the space  
between the sleeve and the assembly and the space between the sleeve and the penetrating item  
must be appropriately protected.  
714.4 Fire-resistance-rated walls. This section regulates the penetration into or through fire  
walls, fire barriers, fire partitions, and smoke barrier walls. The protection of penetrations in fire-  
resistance-rated exterior walls is not addressed; however, where such exterior walls are bearing  
walls it is necessary to consider penetration protection in order to maintain the structural integrity  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationof the walls during fire conditions. Fire-resistance-rated interior bearing walls are also not  
specifically identified as elements regulated for penetrating items; however, any penetrations of  
such walls should be addressed in order to maintain the necessary structural fire resistance. For  
the most part, membrane penetrations are addressed in the same manner as through penetrations.  
714.4.1 Through-penetrations. As a general rule, through-penetrations \(where the penetrating  
items pass through the entire assembly\) are required to be firestopped with approved through-  
penetration firestop systems when the penetrations pass through fire-resistance-rated walls,  
unless the approved wall assembly is tested with the penetrations as a part of the assembly. The  
firestop system is required to have an F rating at least equivalent to that of the fire-resistance  
rating of the wall penetrated, as shown in Figure 714-3. There is no requirement for a T rating on  
a wall penetration, justified on the basis that there is no need for such a restrictive temperature  
rating for the penetration of wall assemblies.  
The IBC contains an exception to the general rule for firestopped wall penetrations allowing  
certain small noncombustible penetrating items no larger than 6-inch \(152-mm\) nominal  
diameter to penetrate concrete or masonry walls, provided the full thickness of the wall, or the  
thickness required to maintain the fire resistance, is filled with concrete, grout, or mortar. The  
size of the opening is limited to 144 square inches \(0.0929 m2\). A second exception that is used  
extensively will allow the annular space around the same type of noncombustible penetrating  
item to be filled with a material that prevents the passage of flame or hot gases sufficient to  
ignite cotton waste when tested under the time-temperature fire conditions of ASTM E119 or UL  
263, and under a positive pressure differential of 0.01-inch \(0.25-mm\) water column. When  
properly installed around the penetrations of noncombustible items, these materials provide  
adequate firestopping between the penetrating item and the fire-resistive membrane of the wall.  
See Figure 714-4.  
Figure 714-3 F rating required.  
714.4.2 Membrane penetrations. This section addresses penetrations through a single  
membrane of fire-resistance-rated walls. For the most part, a membrane penetration is to be  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprotected by one of the methods established for through-penetrations as previously described.  
However, there are some membrane penetrations that are allowed without a specific firestopping  
material in the annular space around such penetrations. Openings for steel electrical boxes are  
specifically addressed where located in walls with a maximum 2-hour rating, provided that they  
are no more than 16 square inches \(0.0103 m2\) in area and the aggregate area of the boxes does  
not exceed 100 square inches \(0.0645 m2\) for any 100 square feet \(9.29 m2\) of wall area. The  
annular space between the wall membrane and any edge of the electrical box is limited to ⅛ inch  
\(3.2 mm\). Also, to prevent an indirect through-penetration, electrical boxes on opposing sides of  
a fire-resistance-rated wall shall be horizontally separated by no less than 24 inches \(610 mm\).  
As an alternative, boxes may be separated horizontally by the depth of the cavity if the cavity is  
filled with cellulose loose-fill, rockwool, or slag mineral wool insulation; by solid fireblocking in  
accordance with Section 718.2.1; by protection of both outlet boxes with listed putty pads; or by  
any other listed methods and materials. Examples of several of these methods are illustrated in  
Figure 714-5.  
Figure 714-4 Through-penetrations of wall.  
A second exception for membrane penetrations of electrical-outlet boxes allows outlet boxes  
of any material, provided they are tested for use in fire-resistance-rated assemblies and installed  
in accordance with the instructions for the listing. Limitations are also placed on the annular  
space surrounding the box and conditions where the boxes are placed on opposite sides of the  
wall. Exception 3 allows for penetrations by electrical boxes of any size or type provided they  
are listed as a part of a wall opening protective material system, while Exception 4 addresses  
boxes, other than electrical boxes, that have annular space protection provided by an approved  
membrane penetration firestop system. The fifth exception permits the annular space created by  
the penetration of a fire sprinkler to be unprotected, provided that such a space is covered by a  
metal escutcheon plate. Because the escutcheon is a part of the listed sprinkler, it is inappropriate  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationto require firestopping at this location. It should be noted that this exception applies to the  
penetration of sprinklers, not simply sprinkler piping or cross mains that might be penetrating  
fire-resistance-rated construction. See Figure 714-6. Exception 6 addresses steel electrical boxes  
that exceed 16 square inches \(0.0103 m2\) in area as well as those where the aggregate area of the  
boxes exceed 100 square inches \(0.0645 m2\) in any 100 square feet \(9.29 m2\) of wall area. Figure  
714-7 also illustrates two of the exceptions.  
Figure 714-5 Penetration of fire-resistance-rated walls.  
714.4.3 Dissimilar materials. This provision is intended to limit the occasional practice of using  
a noncombustible penetrating item \(such as a short metal coupling\) to penetrate a fire-resistance-  
rated wall, then connect to a combustible item \(such as plastic piping or conduit\) on the room  
side of the wall. The building official can accept such a condition where it is demonstrated that  
the fire-resistive integrity of the wall will be maintained. See Figure 714-7.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation714.5 Horizontal assemblies. The shaft enclosure provisions of Section 713 intend to maintain a  
level of protection that is compromised when one or more openings occur in a floor or  
floor/ceiling assembly. However, penetrations by pipes, tubes, conduit, wire, cable, and vents are  
permitted without shaft enclosure protection where in compliance with this section. In addition,  
this section addresses penetrations that occur in the ceiling of a roof/ceiling assembly.  
Penetrations occurring in both fire-resistance-rated horizontal assemblies and non-fire-resistance-  
rated assemblies are addressed.  
Figure 714-6 Membrane penetration protection.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 714-7 Membrane penetrations of walls.  
714.5.1 Through-penetrations. The protection requirements for the through-penetration of fire-  
resistance-rated horizontal assemblies are very similar to those required for vertical elements.  
The general provisions state that the penetrations are to be installed as tested in an approved fire-  
resistance-rated assembly or protected by an approved through-penetration firestop system.  
Where a firestop system is used, it must have both an F rating and a T rating equivalent to the  
floor penetrated, but in no case less than 1 hour. Only an F rating is needed if the penetrating  
item, as it passes through the floor, is contained within a wall cavity above or below the floor.  
See Figure 714-8. Exception 2 indicates that a T rating is also not required where the floor  
penetration is a floor drain, tub drain, or shower drain.  
Noncombustible penetration items are granted exceptions to the general requirements as  
previously discussed for fire-resistance-rated walls. Where only a single fire-resistance- rated  
floor is penetrated, the annular space around the noncombustible penetration item need only to  
be protected with any material that essentially preforms equivalent to an F-rating when tested as  
stated. There is no limit on the size of the penetrating items, provided they are appropriately  
protected. Where multiple floor assemblies are penetrated, the size of any penetrating item is  
limited to 6 inches \(152 mm\) in nominal diameter. In addition, the area of the opening in the  
floor is limited to 144 square inches \(92,900 mm2\) in any 100 square feet \(9.3 m2\) of floor area.  
Figure 714-9 depicts the use of this exception. Allowances are also provided for noncombustible  
penetrations of concrete floors as well as for tested electrical outlet boxes.  
714.5.2 Membrane penetrations. Fire-resistance-rated horizontal assemblies must be  
adequately protected at penetrations of the floor or ceiling membrane. Therefore, they are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationregulated in the same manner as through-penetrations addressed in Section 714.5.1. The code  
also specifies that any recessed fixtures that are installed in fire-resistance-rated horizontal  
assemblies shall not reduce the level of required fire resistance. Exceptions to the general  
requirement for approved firestop systems apply to noncombustible penetrations, steel electrical  
boxes, boxes listed as a part of an opening protective material system, listed electrical-outlet  
boxes, fire sprinklers, noncombustible items cast into concrete building elements or listed  
luminaires. See Figure 714-10.  
Figure 714-8 Through-penetrations of horizontal assemblies.  
Exception 7 allows for the practical application of the code where wood-framed walls extend  
up and attach directly to the underside of wood floor joists/trusses or roof joists/trusses for  
structural requirements. However, there are limits to its use. Double wood top plates are allowed  
to interrupt the gypsum-board membrane of the floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling membrane. The  
allowance is only permitted where the horizontal assembly has a required fire-resistance rating of  
2 hours or less, and the intersecting wall must be sheathed with Type X gypsum wallboard.  
Piping, conduit, and similar items within the fire-resistance-rated wall must be adequately  
protected where they penetrate the double-wood top plate. Compliance with the established  
criteria is deemed to provide for an equivalent degree of fire resistance and protection at the  
discontinuous portion of the ceiling membrane where the double wood top plates occur. See  
Figure 714-11.  
714.6 Non-fire-resistance-rated assemblies. Figure 714-12 illustrates the provisions for  
penetrations of those horizontal assemblies not required to have a fire-resistance rating. Section  
713 for shaft enclosures will regulate such penetrations where the allowances set forth in this  
section are not applicable. Where penetrations connect only two stories, the annular space around  
the penetrating items must simply be protected with a material that resists the free passage of fire  
and smoke. If the penetrating items are noncombustible, up to five stories may be connected,  
provided the annular space is filled appropriately.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 714-9 Penetrations of horizontal assemblies.  
Section 715 Joints and Voids  
A fire-resistant joint system is defined in Section 202 as “an assemblage of specific materials or  
products that are designed, tested, and fire-resistance rated in accordance with either ASTM  
E1966 or UL 2079 to resist, for a prescribed period of time, the passage of fire through joints  
made in or between fire-resistance-rated assemblies.  
” The term joint is also defined as “the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationopening in or between adjacent assemblies that is created due to building tolerances, or is  
designed to allow independent movement of the building, in any plane, caused by thermal,  
seismic, wind, or any other loading.  
” The approved system should be designed to resist the  
passage of fire for a time period not less than the required fire-resistance rating of the floor, roof,  
or wall in or between which it is installed. See Figure 715-1.  
Figure 714-10 Membrane penetrations of horizontal assemblies.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 714-11 Horizontal assembly continuity at fire-rated wall.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 714-12 Non-fire-resistance-rated assemblies.  
The code lists ten locations where it is not necessary to provide fire-resistant joint systems.  
For most of the applications listed, they are also locations where fire assemblies are not required  
to protect openings in the horizontal or vertical assemblies. Item 9 references maximum ⅝-inch  
\(15.9-mm\) control joints when tested in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263.  
715.4 Exterior curtain wall/fire-resistance-rated floor intersections. Vertical passages  
without barriers allow fire and hot gases to circumvent the protection for occupants in the floors  
above. When floors or floor/ceiling assemblies do not extend to the exterior face of a building,  
this section requires an approved perimeter fire containment system at the intersection at least  
equal to the fire resistance of the floor or floor/ceiling assembly. See Figure 715-2.  
ASTM E2307 is identified as the general specification and testing method used to determine  
the necessary fire resistance. This test method measures the performance of a perimeter fire-  
containment system and its ability to maintain a seal to prevent fire spread during the deflection  
and deformation of the exterior wall assembly and floor assembly expected during a fire  
condition, while resisting fire exposure from both an interior compartment and the flame plume  
emitted from a window burner as shown in the Figure 715-2.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation715.5 Exterior curtain wall/nonfire-resistance-rated floor assembly intersections. A  
minimum level of protection is also mandated at any voids created at the intersection of an  
exterior curtain wall and a nonrated floor or floor assembly. The required method is consistent  
with that required in the code for the penetration of ducts and other items through non-fire-  
resistance-rated floor systems. The void space is to be filled with an “approved” material that  
retards the free passage of flame and products of combustion between the stories. See Figure  
715-2.  
Figure 715-1 Fire-resistant joint systems.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 715-2 Exterior curtain wall/floor intersection.  
Section 716 Opening Protectives  
In the context of the IBC, an opening protective refers to a fire door, fire shutter, or fire-  
protection-rated glazing, including the required frames, sills, anchorage, and hardware for its  
proper operation. Generally, whenever any fire door, fire shutter, or fire-protection-rated glazing  
is referred to, it is the intent of the code that the entire fire assembly be included.  
716.1.2.2.4 Fire-rated glazing that exceeds the code requirements. Both fire-resistance-rated  
glazing and fire-protection-rated glazing must be appropriately identified for verification of their  
appropriate application. These markings establish compliance with hose-stream and temperature  
rise requirements, while also identifying the minimum assembly rating in minutes. It is not  
unusual for such glazing to be marked indicating a higher degree of protection than mandated by  
the code. This provision clarifies that the use of glazing marked to indicate a higher level of  
compliance is permitted for use where such compliance is not required.  
716.1.2.3 Fire-resistance-rated glazing. This section is an extension of the provisions in  
Section 703.4 regarding the use of fire-resistance-rated glazing. Where such glazing is  
appropriately tested and labeled, its use is permitted in fire doors and fire window assemblies as  
specified in Table 716.1\(2\). Such glazing tested as a part of a wall assembly per ASTM E119 or  
UL 263 is not required to comply with the provisions of Section 716 where used as a part of the  
wall.  
Table 716.1\(1\) defines and relates the various test standards for fire-rated glazing to the  
designations used to mark such glazing. The table reflects the use of the designations “W,  
” “FC”  
,  
“OH,  
” “D,  
” “T,  
” “H,  
” and “XXX” as markings for fire-rated glazing. Tables 716.1\(2\) and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation716.1\(3\) set forth the markings required for acceptance in specified applications. The marking of  
fire-rated glazing does not include the “NH” \(not hose-stream tested\) and “NT” \(not temperature-  
rise tested\) designations, as these designations correspond with test standards, not end uses.  
716.2 Fire door assemblies. This section sets forth the test standards and additional criteria  
necessary for the acceptance of fire door assemblies. In addition, Table 716.1\(2\) identifies the  
minimum fire-protection rating for an opening protective based on the type of assembly in which  
it is installed. For example, a door assembly in a 1-hour fire barrier wall separating hazardous  
material control areas would need to have a minimum ¾-hour fire-protective rating, whereas a 1-  
hour fire-resistance-rated interior exit stairway enclosure would require a minimum 1-hour door  
assembly.  
Side-hinged or swinging doors are to be tested for conformance with NFPA 252 or UL 10C. It  
is important that the NFPA 252 test provides for positive pressure in the furnace as established  
by this section. See Figure 716-1. For other types of doors, the pressure level at the top of the  
door need only be maintained as nearly equal to the atmosphere’s pressure as possible.  
716.2.2.1 Door assemblies in corridors and smoke barriers. Fire door assemblies located in  
fire-resistance-rated corridor walls or smoke barrier walls are further regulated where required by  
Table 716.1\(2\) to have a 20-minute fire-protection rating. They are commonly referred to as  
smoke- and draft-control assemblies. Their primary purpose is to minimize smoke leakage  
around the door and through the opening. For this reason, these doors shall not contain louvers  
and per Section 716.2.10 must be installed in accordance with NFPA 105.  
Figure 716-1 Fire test of door assemblies.  
The protection of fire-rated corridors is intended to be a two-way protection. Although the  
general intent is to protect the corridor from smoke that might be generated by a fire occurring  
within the adjacent use spaces, there are occasions where it is just as important to protect the  
occupied use spaces from smoke in the corridor. The fire test for corridor and smoke-barrier  
doors is essentially the same test of the door as for other fire-door assemblies, except that the fire  
test for the 20-minute assembly does not include the hose-stream test. In addition, Section  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation716.2.1.4 requires the door assembly to be tested for smoke infiltration through the UL 1784 air  
leakage test and Section 716.2.2.1.1 identifies the criteria for acceptance. Note that per Section  
716.2.1.3, glazing other than in the door itself, such as in sidelites or transoms, must be tested  
with the hose-stream test as set forth in NFPA 257 or UL 9.  
Within Section 716.2.2.1, an exception permits the installation of a viewport through the door  
for purposes of observation. These viewports must be installed under the limitations of, and in  
accordance with, the conditions specified in the exception. Corridor door provisions are modified  
in Section 407.3.1 for Group I-2 occupancies and in multitheater complexes as shown in Figure  
716-2\. In addition, where horizontal sliding doors are used in smoke barriers of Group I-3  
occupancies as specified, the 20-minute fire-protection rating is not required.  
716.2.2.3 Doors in interior exit stairways and ramps and exit passageways. In addition to the  
normal requirement for fire doors, the IBC is concerned that fire door assemblies installed in  
enclosures for interior exit stairways/ramps and exit passageways shall be capable of limiting the  
temperature transmission through the door. It specifies that the temperature rise above ambient  
temperature shall be limited to a maximum of 450°F \(232°C\) at the end of 30 minutes of the  
normal fire test. However, in buildings equipped with an automatic sprinkler system, the  
temperature limitation is not applicable.  
The purpose of these highly protected exit elements and their openings is to protect the  
building occupants while they are exiting the building. It is intended that in a properly enclosed  
and protected interior exit stairway or ramp enclosure, building occupants from the floors above  
the fire floor will be able to pass through the fire floor inside the enclosure and eventually pass  
down and out of the building. The end-point limitation on temperature transmission through the  
fire door, then, is literally to protect the person inside the enclosure from excessive heat radiation  
from the fire door as he or she passes through the fire floor. In sprinklered buildings, the  
maximum transmitted temperature end point is not required. It is expected that a sprinkler system  
will limit the fire growth to the point where such extra care is unnecessary.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 716-2 Corridor doors in a multitheater complex.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 716-3 Identification of glazing in fire doors.  
Figure 716-4 Glazing limitations.  
716.2.5.1 Size limitations. This section addresses both fire-resistance-rated and the lower  
performing fire-protection rated glazing. In a door, fire-protection-rated glazing is permitted in  
wall assemblies rated at 1 hour or less when in compliance with the size limitations of NFPA 80.  
Where a fire wall or fire barrier requires a rating greater than 1 hour, such glazing is prohibited  
except for two conditions. First, fire-protection-rated glazing may be used as vision panels in  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationswinging fire door assemblies serving as horizontal exits when limited in size. Owing to the use  
of a horizontal exit as a required means of egress, it is often beneficial to provide a glass light of  
limited size so that occupants may view the egress path ahead of them. Second, the maximum  
size of all types of fire-protection-rated glazing in 1½-hour fire doors is limited to 100 square  
inches \(0.065 m2\) when installed in a fire barrier.  
716.2.6.1 Door closing. The code mandates that fire doors be provided with closers to allow  
them to shut and protect the opening without manual operation. One exception to this broad-  
based requirement applies to those fire doors located in the common walls between sleeping  
units of hotels and motels. These doors are so seldom open that it is unreasonable to require  
door-closing hardware.  
716.2.6.4 Automatic-closing fire door assemblies. Where automatic-closing devices are used  
instead of self-closing devices on fire doors, they must also comply with the provisions of NFPA  
80 for self-closing action. Although they are generally held in an open position, doors equipped  
with automatic-closing devices become self-closing when actuated. The use of automatic-closing  
devices is typically a design decision; however, the code does mandate such devices for doors in  
four applications. Automatic-closing devices are required by Section 709.5.1 on cross-corridor  
doors located in Group I-2 occupancies and ambulatory care facilities. They must also be  
installed on cross-corridor doors located in a horizontal exit as set forth in Section 1026.3.  
Sections 405.4.3 and 3008.6.3.2 related to protecting doors on elevator lobbies are the other door  
locations where automatic-closing devices are required. Though not a door, rolling type fire  
shutters also require the use of automatic-closing devices per Section 716.2.8.  
716.2.6.6 Smoke-activated doors. This section identifies eight locations where a smoke detector  
is to be used to actuate the closing operation for an automatic-closing fire door where such a  
closing device is provided. The detectors must be installed in accordance with the provisions of  
Section 907.3 and, furthermore, they must be of an approved type that will release the door in the  
event of a power failure. Automatic-closing fire door assemblies are often used to increase the  
reliability of the opening protection. Swinging fire doors with self-closers are all too often  
propped open with wood blocks or wedges. Although this section regulates the method for  
activating automatic-closing fire doors, it does not identify where automatic-closing doors are  
mandated. It is only if automatic-closing doors are installed at these locations that the code then  
mandates they are smoke-activated closers.  
716.2.9 Labeled protective assemblies. Fire doors are required to have an approved label or  
listing mark permanently affixed at the factory. The label must contain information that identifies  
the manufacturer, the third-party inspection agency, and the fire-protection rating. Where  
applicable, the maximum transmitted temperature end point or the smoke- and draft-control  
designation must be identified.  
Listing agencies will typically only label door assemblies that have been tested. However,  
some door assemblies are too large to be tested in available furnaces. As a result, the code  
permits the installation of oversized fire doors under the conditions of this section. As oversized  
fire doors are not subjected to the standard fire test, an approved testing agency must provide a  
certificate of inspection from them certifying that, except for the fact that the doors are oversized,  
they comply with the requirements for materials, design, and construction for a fire door of the  
specified fire-endurance rating. An approved agency may also provide a label on the door  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationindicating it is oversized. Where the certificate or label of an approved agency has been  
provided, there is assurance that the fire door will protect the opening as required by the code.  
The letter “S” on a fire door indicates that it is in compliance with UL 1784, the air leakage  
testing. Through this identifying mark, it is possible to quickly identify the door and frame  
assembly as appropriate provided listed or labeled gasketing is installed.  
Individual components, such as vision panels, may be installed in labeled fire doors provided  
such components are listed or classified and labeled for use by a third-party agency.  
716.2.9.5 Labeling. Glazing used in fire door assemblies must be identified for verification of its  
appropriate application. As established in Table 716.1\(1\), the “D” designation indicates the  
glazing can be used in a fire door assembly, with the remaining identifiers providing specific  
information as to the glazing’s capability to meet the hose-stream test and temperature limits. See  
Figure 716-3.  
716.3.4 Fire-protection-rated glazing. In many situations, it is necessary to provide glazed  
openings in fire-resistance-rated walls. The provisions of this section address fire window  
assemblies installed as opening protectives in fire partitions and exterior walls, as well as in  
some 1-hour fire barriers.  
Fire-protection-rated glazing in fire window assemblies must be tested in accordance with  
NFPA 257 or UL 9. In addition, they must be installed and sized in accordance with NFPA 80.  
In all cases, a fire-window assembly must include an approved frame, be fixed in position, or be  
automatic closing.  
In interior applications, fire-protection-rated glazing is limited to fire partitions, smoke  
barriers, and three types of fire barriers \(per Table 716.1\(3\)\) having a maximum fire-resistance  
rating of 1 hour. Per Section 716.3.2.1.2 the total aggregate area of fire windows cannot exceed  
25 percent of the area of the common wall between areas, as shown in Figure 716-4. In making  
this 25-percent calculation, it is permissible to assume the entire area of the common wall even  
though a portion of that area might be taken up by doors. This gross area is usable in calculating  
the maximum percentage of area for windows. Where the ceilings are of different heights, the  
lower ceiling establishes the gross area.  
Fire-protection-rated glazing is not permitted to be located in any fire wall or in any fire  
barrier \(with three exceptions\); however, Section 716.1.2.3 recognizes that glazing tested as a  
part of a wall assembly is permitted in all applications and, therefore, not regulated by this  
section. This type of glazing is referred to as fire-resistance-rated glazing, rather than fire-  
protection-rated glazing, and is further addressed in Section 703.4. In addition, the 25-percent  
area limitation is not applicable. Glazing that has a fire-resistance rating under ASTM E119 or  
UL 263 that meets the fire-resistance rating of the wall may be used in more applications than  
fire-protection-rated glazing complying with NFPA 257 or UL 9. Also see the discussion of  
Section 703.4.  
Section 717 Ducts and Air Transfer Openings  
Where a duct or air transfer opening penetrates a fire-resistance-rated assembly, it is often  
necessary that a method of protection be provided to maintain the integrity of the assembly.  
Many times, dampers are used to protect the opening created by the duct or transfer opening. If  
dampers are not required to be provided under the provisions of this section, it is still necessary  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationto protect the penetration under the provisions of Sections 717.1.2 and 714.1.1.  
717.2 Installation. This section states that fire and smoke dampers shall be installed in  
accordance with their listing. The test standards for each of the types of damper carry specific  
requirements that manufacturers provide installation and operating instructions, and that a  
reference to these instructions shall be a part of the required marking information on the damper.  
Subsection 717.2.3 restricts the location where static dampers can be used. Only fire dampers  
labeled for use in dynamic systems shall be installed in systems intended to operate with fans on  
during a fire. The test standard for fire dampers states that fire dampers are intended for use in  
either static systems that are automatically shut down in the event of a fire, or in dynamic  
systems that are operational in the event of a fire. If the HVAC system has not been designed and  
constructed to shut down in case of a fire, then dynamically listed fire dampers are necessary.  
Similar provisions are also applicable to ceiling radiation dampers. Special attention should be  
paid to damper listings when smoke-control systems are installed under the provisions of Section  
909 since they operate under a variety of conditions that may be more demanding depending on  
the design and sequencing of the system.  
717.3.1 Damper testing. Dampers must not only be listed but also bear a label indicating that  
the damper is in compliance with the appropriate standard as identified by this section. For  
example, for fire dampers the required information on the damper includes the hourly rating; the  
words “Fire Damper”; whether or not the damper is to be in a dynamic or static system \(or both\);  
maximum rated airflow and pressure differential across the closed damper for dampers intended  
for use in dynamic systems; an arrow showing direction of airflow for dampers intended for use  
in dynamic systems; the intended mounting position \(vertical, horizontal, or both\); top of  
damper; and, of course, the manufacturer’s name and model number. UL 555 \(which applies to  
fire dampers\) requires that all of this information shall be available on the damper label, which is  
installed at the factory, and that all labels shall be located on the internal surface of the damper  
and be readily visible after the damper is installed. UL 555 indicates that fire dampers tested  
under that standard are intended for use in HVAC duct systems passing through fire-resistive  
walls, partitions, or floor assemblies.  
Just as fire dampers are tested for different hourly ratings, they are also tested for different  
installation positions. A damper listed for vertical installation cannot arbitrarily be installed in  
the horizontal position.  
Test standard UL 555S is to be used to determine the compliance of smoke dampers. This  
standard states that leakage-rated dampers \(smoke dampers in the IBC\) are intended to restrict  
the spread of smoke in HVAC systems that are designed to automatically shut down in the event  
of a fire, or to control the movement of smoke within a building when the HVAC system is  
operational in engineered smoke-control systems.  
In addition to fire dampers and smoke dampers, three other types of dampers are referenced in  
the IBC. Where combination fire/smoke dampers are provided, they must comply with the  
requirements of both UL 555 for fire dampers and UL 555S for smoke dampers. Figure 717-1  
illustrates the installation of an automatic-closing combination fire and smoke damper. Ceiling  
radiation dampers, intended for installation in air-handling openings penetrating the ceiling  
membranes of fire-resistance-rated floor/ceiling and roof/ceiling assemblies, are to meet the  
conditions of UL 555C.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 717-1 Combination fire and smoke dampers.  
Corridor dampers are to be utilized in a specific application, where \(1\) air ducts penetrate or  
terminate at horizontal openings, \(2\) provided such openings occur in the ceiling of a fire-  
resistance-rated corridor, and \(3\) if the corridor ceiling is constructed as required for corridor  
walls as further addressed in Exception 3 of Section 708.4. See Figure 717-2. The listing and  
testing of a corridor damper is different from the regular combination fire/smoke damper in that  
the testing is done in a wall assembly installed in the horizontal position.  
717.3.2.1 Fire damper ratings. Test standard UL 555 covers fire dampers ranging from 1½  
hours to 3 hours. Because fire dampers carry an hourly rating, plans should reflect the rating  
required at a particular location if more than one rating is required within a building. Table  
717.3.2.1 indicates whether a 1½-hour or 3-hour rating is required for a fire damper, based on the  
fire-resistance rating of the assembly in which it is installed. In all applications rated at 3 hours  
or greater, a 3-hour-rated damper is mandated; otherwise, a 1½-hour damper is acceptable.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 717-2 Corridor damper application.  
717.3.2.2 Smoke damper ratings. A Class I or Class II leakage rating is required for smoke  
dampers, which also must have an elevated temperature rating of at least 250°F \(121°C\). The  
class designation indicates the maximum leakage permitted in cubic feet per minute per square  
foot \(cubic mm per minute per mm2\) for the particular class. The three classes progress from  
Class I \(least leakage or best performance\) through Class III \(greatest leakage or poorest  
performance\). The IBC requires conformance with Class I or II, so a damper rated as Class III  
would not be acceptable. These leakage ratings are determined at ambient temperature after  
exposing the damper to temperature degradation at an elevated temperature, with 250°F \(121°C\)  
being the lowest elevated temperature allowed by the code. Dampers can be tested using higher  
degradation temperatures \[one as high as 850°F \(454°C\)\], but most listed dampers seem to have  
been tested at either 250°F \(121°C\) or 350°F \(177°C\).  
The provisions of Section 717.3.3.2 specifically instruct the designer or installer on how to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcontrol smoke dampers. Smoke dampers are required to be closed by activation of smoke  
detectors installed in accordance with Section 907.3 for fire-detection systems and any of the five  
specified methods of control listed in this provision. These methods of control, each having  
benefits and drawbacks, were proposed by those individuals involved with damper installation  
and should provide consistent and logical control methods for the dampers.  
717.4 Access and identification. Both fire dampers and smoke dampers shall be installed so that  
they are accessible for inspection and servicing. Where access is limited or restricted, Section  
717.4.1.2 requires that provisions are made for remote inspection. It is important that any access  
openings in a fire-resistance-rated assembly be adequately protected in order to maintain the  
integrity of the assembly. This will typically involve the use of an access door having the  
required fire-protection rating. Permanent identification of the access points to fire-damper and  
smoke-damper locations is also mandated.  
717.5 Where required. This section lists those specific locations where the various dampers are  
required. Dampers need only be installed in ducts and transfer openings where specifically  
identified by this section. In some locations, both a fire damper and a smoke damper are  
required. This means that either two dampers must be installed or a damper listed for both fire  
and smoke control must be used. Remember Section 717.1.2 requires duct penetrations of rated  
assemblies, which do not require dampers to be protected as penetrations.  
717.5.1 Fire walls. Because of the importance of maintaining the separation provided by fire  
walls used to divide a structure into two or more separate buildings, the code requires the use of  
approved fire dampers under all conditions. Such dampers are to be installed at all permitted duct  
penetrations and air-transfer openings of fire walls. Where the fire wall serves as a party wall as  
addressed in Section 706.1.1, ducts and air transfer openings are prohibited. There is no  
requirement for smoke dampers at duct penetrations and air openings through fire walls except  
for those fire walls serving as horizontal exits.  
717.5.2 Fire barriers. Much like fire walls, fire barriers are designed to totally isolate one area  
of a building from another. Therefore, the general requirement is that all duct penetrations and air  
transfer openings of fire barriers be protected by complying fire dampers. There are, however,  
several exceptions that may eliminate the need for dampers. Of special note is the elimination of  
fire dampers in certain sprinklered buildings. Fire dampers are not required for duct penetrations  
and air openings in fire barriers where all of the following conditions exist\:  
1\. 2. 3. 4. The penetration consists of a duct that is a portion of a fully ducted HVAC system.  
The fire-resistance rating of the fire barrier is 1 hour or less.  
The area is not a Group H occupancy.  
The building is fully protected by an automatic fire-sprinkler system.  
A fire barrier that serves as a horizontal exit must also be provided with a listed smoke  
damper at each point a duct or air transfer opening penetrates the fire barrier.  
717.5.3 Shaft enclosures. Both a fire damper and a smoke damper, or a combination fire/smoke  
damper, must be installed where a duct or air transfer opening penetrates a shaft enclosure. Five  
exceptions identify conditions under which fire or smoke dampers are not required. As shown in  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 717-3, the first exception permits fire dampers to be eliminated where steel exhaust  
subducts enter an exhaust shaft. The subducts must extend vertically at least 22 inches \(559 mm\),  
and there must be continuously powered air flow upward to the outside through the shaft. Smoke  
dampers are also not required under similar conditions, but the exception is limited to fully  
sprinklered Group B and R occupancies where the fan providing continuous airflow is on  
standby power. Exception 5 exempts fire dampers and fire/smoke dampers in kitchen and clothes  
dryer exhaust systems due to potential obstruction hazards. Smoke dampers are not addressed in  
this exception, but may be omitted when Exception 2 is applied.  
717.5.4 Fire partitions. Fire partitions are not regulated by the code as highly as fire barriers or  
fire walls, so it is consistent that the requirements for dampers through such partitions are not as  
restrictive. The general rule is that a fire damper is required in any duct or air transfer opening  
that penetrates a fire partition. However, where the building is fully sprinklered, ducts  
penetrating tenant separation walls in covered mall buildings or fire-resistance-rated corridor  
walls need not be fire dampered. In addition, fire dampers are not necessary for small steel ducts  
installed above a ceiling, provided the duct does not communicate between a corridor and  
adjacent rooms and does not terminate at a register in a fire-resistance-rated wall. The fourth  
exception is conceptually consistent with Exception 3 of Section 717.5.2 addressing fire barriers.  
717.5.4.1 Corridors. Because a fire-resistance-rated corridor is intended to be an exit access  
component providing a limited degree of occupant protection during egress activities, it is logical  
that air openings into the corridor be addressed. This section mandates, with exceptions, that all  
corridors required to be protected with smoke- and draft-control doors shall also be provided  
with smoke dampers where ducts or air transfer openings penetrate the corridor enclosures.  
Additional protection is required where ducts and air transfer openings penetrate the ceiling of a  
fire-resistance-rated corridor. Either a corridor damper or a ceiling radiation damper shall be  
installed depending upon the method of ceiling construction. As illustrated in Figure 717-4, an  
important exception eliminates the need for smoke dampers where steel ducts pass through, but  
do not serve, the corridor.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 717-3 Exhaust subducts penetrating shafts.  
717.5.5 Smoke barriers. Those air openings, both ducts and transfer openings, that penetrate  
smoke barriers are to be provided with smoke dampers at the points of penetration. Steel ducts  
are permitted to pass through a smoke barrier without a damper, provided the openings in the  
ducts are limited to a single smoke compartment. Fire dampers are not required at penetrations of  
smoke barriers.  
717.6 Horizontal assemblies. The code is quite restrictive when it comes to the protection of  
vertical openings between floor levels, particularly where the floor or floor/ceiling assembly is  
required to be fire-resistance rated. This section requires the use of a shaft enclosure to address  
the hazard that is created where a duct or air transfer opening extends through a floor,  
floor/ceiling assembly, or ceiling membrane of a roof/ceiling assembly. The remainder of the  
section modifies this general requirement for through-penetrations, membrane penetrations, and  
non-fire-resistance-rated assemblies.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 717-4 Ducts crossing corridor.  
717.6.1 Through-penetrations. Ducts and air transfer openings that penetrate horizontal  
assemblies are initially regulated by the provisions of Section 713 for shaft enclosures. Permitted  
in all occupancies other than Groups I-2 and I-3, a shaft enclosure is not required where a duct  
that connects only two stories is provided with a fire damper installed at the floor line of the fire-  
resistance-rated floor/ceiling assembly that is penetrated. As an option, the duct may be protected  
in a manner prescribed in Section 714.5 for the penetration of horizontal assemblies. The code’s  
intent to limit fire and smoke migration between smoke compartments vertically in Group I-2  
and I-3 occupancies is maintained through the limitation imposed in this section. The exception  
goes on to eliminate the fire damper requirement as it relates to dwelling units and sleeping units,  
provided the duct penetrates no more than three floors.  
717.6.2 Membrane penetrations. A shaft enclosure need not be provided where an approved  
ceiling radiation damper is installed at the ceiling line of a fire-resistance-rated floor/ceiling or  
roof/ceiling assembly penetrated by a duct or air-transfer opening. Designed to protect the  
construction elements of the floor or roof assembly, the ceiling radiation damper is not required  
where fire tests have shown that the damper is not necessary to maintain the fire-resistance rating  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationof the assembly. Additionally, ceiling radiation dampers are not required at penetrations of  
exhaust ducts, provided the penetrations are appropriately protected, the exhaust ducts are  
contained within wall cavities, and the ducts do not pass through adjacent dwelling units or  
tenant spaces.  
717.6.3 Non-fire-resistance-rated floor assemblies. The elimination of shaft enclosures at  
vertical openings is also possible where the floor assemblies are not required to be of fire-  
resistance-rated construction. Two conditions are identified using the filling of the annular space  
between the assembly and the penetrating duct with an approved noncombustible material that  
will resist the free passage of fire and smoke. Where only two stories are connected, no other  
protective measures are necessary. In three-story conditions, a fire damper must be installed at  
each floor line. The code also mandates that the floor assembly be of noncombustible  
construction and the annular space surrounding the penetrating duct be filled with an approved  
noncombustible material, such as a sealant, that will resist the free passage of flame, smoke, and  
gases. However, the installation of such sealant or other material would typically void the listing  
of the damper. Under such conditions, the use of the damper’s steel mounting angles would  
satisfy the intended purpose of the annular space protection. An exception permits this method of  
protection in a dwelling unit without the installation of a fire damper.  
Section 718 Concealed Spaces  
Fireblocking and draftstopping are required in combustible construction to cut off concealed  
draft openings \(both vertical and horizontal\). The code requires that fireblocking form an  
effective barrier between floors and between the top story and attic space. The code also requires  
that attic spaces be subdivided, as will be discussed later, along with concealed spaces within  
roof/ceiling and floor/ceiling assemblies. Figures 718-1 through 718-4 depict IBC requirements  
for fireblocking.  
Experience has shown that some of the greatest damage occurs to conventional wood-framed  
buildings during a fire when the fire travels unimpeded through concealed draft openings. This  
often occurs before the fire department has an opportunity to control the fire, and greater damage  
is created as a result of the lack of fireblocking.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 718-1 Fireblocking.  
Figure 718-2 Fireblocks—vertical and horizontal space connections.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 718-3 Fireblocks—stairs.  
Figure 718-4 Fireblocks—pipes, chimneys, etc.  
For these reasons, the code requires fireblocking and draftstopping to prevent the spread of  
fire through concealed combustible draft passageways. Virtually any concealed air space within a  
building will provide an open channel that can bring air to a fire, or through which high-  
temperature air and gases will spread. Fire and hot gases will spread through concealed spaces  
between joists, between studs, within furred spaces, and through any other hidden channel that is  
not fireblocked.  
718.2 Fireblocking. The platform framing method that is used most often today in wood-frame  
construction provides adequate fireblocking between stories in the stud walls, but care must be  
exercised to ensure that furred spaces are effectively fireblocked to prevent transmission of fire  
and hot gases between stories or along a wall. For this reason, the code requires that fireblocking  
be provided at 10-foot \(3,048-mm\) intervals horizontally along walls that are either furred out, of  
double-wall construction, or of staggered-stud construction.  
Fireblocking provisions for wood flooring used typically in gymnasiums, bowling alleys,  
dance floors, and similar uses containing concealed sleeper spaces are found in Section 718.2.7.  
As long as the wood flooring described in this section is in direct contact with a concrete or  
masonry fire-resistance-rated floor, there is no significant hazard. However, if there is a void  
between the wood flooring and the fire-resistance-rated floor, a blind space is created that is  
enclosed with combustible materials and provides a route for the undetected spread of fire.  
Therefore, the code requires that where the wood flooring is not in contact with the fire-  
resistance-rated floor, the space shall be filled with noncombustible material or shall be  
fireblocked. Two exceptions to these fireblocking requirements are\:  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1\. The first exception exempts slab-on-grade floors of gymnasiums. In this case, the code  
presumes a low hazard, as gymnasiums are usually only one story in height. If the floor is  
at or below grade, it is unlikely that any ignition sources would be present to start a fire  
that would spread through the blind space under the wood flooring.  
2\. Bowling lanes are exempted from fireblocking except as described in the code, which  
provides for areas larger than 100 square feet \(9.3 m2\) between fire blocks. Fireblocking  
intermittently down a bowling lane would create problems for a consistent lane surface.  
Fireblocking materials are required to consist of lumber, mass timber, or wood structural  
panels of the thicknesses specified, gypsum board, cement fiber board, mineral wool, glass fiber,  
or any other approved materials securely fastened in place.  
Batts or blankets of mineral wool and glass fiber materials are allowed to be used as  
fireblocking and work especially well where parallel or staggered-stud walls are used. Loose-fill  
insulation should not be used as a fireblocking material unless specifically tested for such use. It  
must also be shown that it will remain in place under fire conditions. Even in the case where it  
fills an entire cavity, a hole knocked into the membrane enclosure for the cavity could allow the  
loose-fill insulation material to fall out, negating its function. Therefore, loose-fill insulation  
material shall not be used as a fireblock unless it has been properly tested to show that it can  
perform the intended function. The main concern is that the loose-fill material, even though it  
may perform adequately in a fire test to show sufficient fire-retardant characteristics to meet the  
intent of this section, would not be adequately evaluated for various applications because of the  
physical instability of the material in certain orientations.  
718.3 Draftstopping in floors. Draftstops are often used to subdivide large concealed spaces  
within floor/ceiling assemblies of combustible construction. Figure 718-5 shows IBC  
requirements for draftstopping in these locations. Gypsum board, wood structural panels,  
particleboard, mineral wool, or glass fiber batts and blankets, and other approved materials are  
considered satisfactory for the purpose of subdividing floor/ceiling areas, provided the materials  
are of adequate thickness, are adequately supported, and their integrity is maintained.  
Draftstops are to be installed in floor/ceiling assemblies as follows\:  
1\. Residential occupancies. The code requires that draftstops be installed in line with the fire  
partitions separating tenants or dwelling units from each other and the remainder of the  
building, consistent with the provisions of Sections 708.4.2 and 420 for dwelling unit and  
sleeping unit separations. In this case, a fire originating in a dwelling unit or hotel room  
will find draftstops in the concealed space blocking the transmission of fire and hot gases  
into another hotel room or apartment. Where the residential occupancy is fully  
sprinklered, draftstopping is not required. Where a residential sprinkler system is used,  
automatic sprinklers must also be installed in the combustible concealed floor areas in  
order to eliminate the draftstops.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 718-5 Draftstops—floors.  
2\. All other occupancies. For uses other than residential occupancies, the code intends that  
the concealed space within the floor/ceiling assembly be separated by draftstopping so  
that the area of any concealed space does not exceed 1,000 square feet \(9.3 m2\). An  
exception permits the elimination of draftstopping where automatic fire sprinklers are  
installed throughout the building.  
718.4 Draftstopping in attics. In attics and concealed roof spaces of combustible construction,  
the code requires draftstopping under certain circumstances. Consistent with the requirements for  
fireblocking, draftstopping is not required for spaces constructed entirely of noncombustible  
materials. Materials used for draftstopping purposes, such as gypsum board, plywood, or  
particleboard, are to be installed consistent with the provisions of Section 718.3.1 for the  
draftstopping of floors. The following locations are identified as those requiring draftstopping\:  
1\. Residential occupancies. The attic draftstops for residential uses are addressed in Section  
708.4.2 due to the reference to that section. Draftstops are to be installed above and in line  
with the walls separating dwelling units or between walls separating sleeping units. Figure  
718-6 explains the intent of Exception 2 in 708.4.2. Exception 4 in 708.4.2 applies to  
Group R-2 occupancies less than five stories in height. In this case, attic areas may be  
increased by installing draftstops to subdivide the attic into a maximum of 3,000-square-  
foot \(279-m2\) spaces, with no area to exceed the inclusion of two dwelling units.  
Exception 1 eliminates the need for draftstopping in fully sprinklered buildings. Where a  
residential sprinkler system is used, the system must be extended into the concealed attic  
space in order to eliminate the draftstop.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 718-6 Attic draftstop—Groups R-1 and R-2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 718-7 Attic draftstop—other than Group R occupancies.  
2\. Other uses. Draftstops are required by the code to be installed in attics and similar  
concealed roof spaces of buildings other than Group R so that the area between draftstops  
does not exceed 3,000 square feet \(279 m2\). As permitted by the exception, draftstopping  
of the attic space is not required in any building equipped throughout with an automatic  
sprinkler system. See Figure 718-7.  
718.5 Combustibles in concealed spaces in Type I or II construction. Where buildings are  
intended to be classified as noncombustible, it is intended that combustibles not be permitted,  
particularly in concealed spaces. The six exceptions to this limitation identify conditions under  
which a limited amount of combustible materials is acceptable. Exception 1 references Section  
603, which identifies 27 applications where combustible materials are permitted in buildings of  
Type I or Type II construction. It is felt that the low level of combustibles permitted, as well as  
their control, does not adversely impact the fire-severity potential caused by the combustible  
materials. Exception 2 permits the use of combustible materials in plenums under the limitations  
and conditions imposed by IMC Section 602. The third exception allows the concealment of  
interior finish materials having a flame-spread index of Class A. Exception 4 addresses  
combustible piping, provided it is located within partitions or enclosed shafts in a complying  
manner. As an example, the presence of plastic pipe within the wall construction of a Type I or II  
building does not cause the building to be considered combustible construction. Exception 5  
allows for the installation of combustible piping within concealed ceiling areas of Type I and II  
buildings, while Exception 6 permits combustible insulation on pipe and tubing in all concealed  
spaces other than plenums.  
Section 719 Fire-Resistance Requirements for Plaster  
Where gypsum plaster or Portland cement plaster is considered a portion of the required fire-  
resistance rating of an assembly, it must be in compliance with this section. Appropriate fire tests  
shall be referenced in determining the minimum required plaster thickness. It is important that  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe material under consideration is addressed in the test, unless the equivalency method of  
Section 719.2 is used.  
In noncombustible buildings, it is necessary that all backing and support be of  
noncombustible materials. Except for solid plaster partitions or where otherwise determined by  
fire tests, it is also necessary in certain plaster applications to double the required reinforcement  
in order to provide for additional bonding, particularly under elevated temperatures. Under  
specific conditions, it is permissible to substitute plaster for concrete in determining the fire-  
resistance rating of the concrete element.  
Section 720 Thermal- and Sound-Insulating Materials  
The intent of this section is to establish code requirements for thermal and acoustical insulation  
located on or within building spaces. This section regulates all insulation except for foam-plastic  
insulation, which is regulated by Section 2603\: duct insulation and insulation in plenums, which  
must comply with the requirements of the IMC; fiberboard insulation as regulated by Chapter 23;  
and reflective plastic core insulation, which must comply with Section 2614.  
As a general requirement, insulation must have a flame spread index not in excess of 25 and a  
smoke-developed index not to exceed 450. Facings such as vapor retarders or vapor permeable  
membranes must be included when testing. Section 720.2.1 waives the flame-spread and smoke-  
developed limitations for facings on insulation installed in buildings of Type III, IV, and V  
construction, provided that the facing is installed behind and in substantial contact with the  
unexposed surface of the ceiling, floor, or wall finish.  
Section 721 Prescriptive Fire Resistance  
In this section, there are many prescriptive details for fire-resistance-rated construction,  
particularly those materials and assemblies listed in Table 721.1\(1\) for structural parts, Table  
721.1\(2\) for walls and partitions, and Table 721.1\(3\) for floor and roof systems. For the most  
part, the listed items have been tested in accordance with the fire-resistance ratings indicated. In  
addition, a similar footnote to all of the tables allows the acceptance of generic assemblies that  
are listed in GA 600, the Gypsum Association’s Fire-Resistance Design Manual. It is important  
to review all of the applicable footnotes when using a material or assembly from one of the  
tables.  
Section 721.1.1 intends that the required thickness of insulating material used to provide fire  
resistance to a structural member cannot be less than the dimension established by Table  
721.1\(1\), except for permitted modifications. An example of the minimum thickness of concrete  
required for a structural-steel column is shown in Figure 721-1. Note that Figure 704-4 illustrates  
that the edges of such members are to be adequately reinforced in compliance with the  
provisions of Section 721.1.3. Figure 721-2 illustrates the provisions of Section 704.7 and the  
minimum concrete-thickness requirements for protecting reinforcing steel in concrete columns,  
beams, girders, and trusses. Refer to Section 704 for additional provisions regarding structural  
members.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 721-1 Prescriptive fire resistance.  
Figure 721-2 Reinforcing steel in concrete columns, beams, girders, and trusses.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 721-3 Walls and partitions.  
As previously mentioned, the fire-resistance ratings for the fire-resistance-rated walls and  
partitions outlined in Table 721.1\(2\) are based on actual tests. Figure 721-3 shows two samples  
from the table. For reinforced concrete walls, it is important to note the type of aggregate as  
discussed earlier in this chapter. The difference in aggregates is quite significant for a 4-hour  
fire-resistance-rated wall, as it amounts to a difference in thickness of almost 2 inches \(51 mm\).  
For hollow-unit masonry walls, the thickness required for a particular fire-endurance rating is the  
equivalent thickness as defined in Section 722.3.1 for concrete masonry and Section 722.4.1.1  
for clay masonry. Figure 721-4 outlines the manner in which the equivalent thickness is  
determined.  
Table 721.1\(3\) of the IBC provides fire-resistance ratings for floor/ceiling and roof/ceiling  
assemblies, and Figure 721-5 depicts the construction of a 1-hour fire-resistance-rated wood  
floor or roof assembly. Of special note is Footnote n, which exempts unusable space from the  
flooring and ceiling requirements. See Figure 711-1.

@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 721-5 One-hour wood floor or roof assembly item number 21-1.1.  
Often, materials such as insulation are added to fire-resistance-rated assemblies. It is the intent  
of the IBC to require substantiating fire test data to show that when the materials are added, they  
do not reduce the required fire-endurance time period. As an example, adding insulation to a  
floor/ceiling assembly may change its capacity to dissipate heat and, particularly for  
noncombustible assemblies, the fire-resistance rating may be changed. Although the primary  
intent of the provision is to cover those cases where thermal insulation is added, the language is  
intentionally broad so that it applies to any material that might be added to the assembly.  
721.1.5 Bonded prestressed concrete tendons. Figure 721-6 depicts the requirements specified  
in Items 1 and 2 for variable concrete cover for tendons. It must be noted that for all cases of  
variable concrete cover, the average concrete cover for the tendons must not be less than the  
cover specified in IBC Table 721.1\(1\).  
As prestressed concrete members are designed in accordance with their ultimate-moment  
capacity, as well as with their performance at service loads, Item 3 provides two sets of criteria  
for variable concrete cover for the multiple tendons\:  
1\. Those tendons having less concrete cover than specified in Table 721.1\(1\) shall be  
considered to be furnishing only a reduced portion of the ultimate-moment capacity of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. member, depending on the cross-sectional area of the member.  
No reduction is necessary for those tendons having reduced cover for the design of the  
member at service loads.  
As the ultimate-moment capacity of the member is critical to the behavior of the member  
under fire conditions, the code requires the reduction for those tendons having cover less than  
that specified by the code. However, behavior at service loads is less affected by the heat of a  
fire; therefore, the code permits those tendons with reduced cover to be assumed as fully  
effective.

Section 722 Calculated Fire Resistance  
Fire research and the theory of heat transmission have combined to make it possible with the  
present state-of-the-art technology to calculate the fire endurance for certain materials and  
assemblies. As a result of this testing and research, this section permits the calculation of the fire-  
resistance rating for assemblies of structural steel, reinforced concrete, wood, concrete masonry,  
clay masonry, and mass timber.  
While the calculated fire-resistance method is generally more conservative than a tested  
assembly, it can provide a quick and convenient way of demonstrating code compliance.  
Therefore, the code users should be aware of the useful information presented in this section,  
including\:  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationKEY POINTS  
• Fire endurance is the basis for the fire-resistance requirements in the IBC.  
• Materials and assemblies tested in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263 are  
considered to be in full compliance with the code for fire-resistance purposes.  
• Elements required to be fire-resistance rated include structural frame members, walls  
and partitions, and floor/ceiling and roof/ceiling assemblies.  
• The method for protecting fire-resistance-rated elements must be in full compliance  
with the desired listing.  
• In many cases, fire-resistance protection for structural members must be applied  
directly to each individual structural member.  
• Exterior walls of buildings located on the same lot are regulated by the placement of an  
assumed line between the two buildings.  
• Where an exterior wall is located an acceptable fire separation distance from the lot  
line, the wall’s fire-resistance rating is allowed to be determined based only on interior  
fire exposure.  
• Opening protection presents a higher fire risk than fire-resistance-rated construction  
insofar as it does not need to meet the heat-transmission limits of ASTM E119 or UL  
263.  
• The maximum area of both protected and unprotected openings permitted in each story  
of an exterior wall is regulated by the fire separation distance.  
• The code intends that each portion of a structure separated by a fire wall be considered  
a separate building for the purpose of height, area, and type of construction limitations.  
• The objective of fire walls is that a complete burnout can occur on one side of the wall  
without any effects of the fire being felt on the opposite side.  
• The purpose of a fire barrier is to totally isolate one portion of a floor from another  
through the use of fire-resistance-rated walls and opening protectives as well as fire-  
resistance-rated horizontal assemblies.  
• Fire barriers are used as the separating elements for interior exit stairways, exit access  
stairways, exit passageways, horizontal exits, incidental use separations, occupancy  
separations, and other areas where a complete separation is required.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation• Fire barriers must begin at the floor and extend uninterrupted to the floor or roof deck  
above.  
• The potential for fire spread vertically through buildings mandates that openings  
through floors be protected with fire-resistance-rated shaft enclosures.  
• Various modifications and exemptions for the enclosure of horizontal openings are  
found in the IBC.  
• Fire partitions are used to separate dwelling units, sleeping units, tenant spaces in  
covered mall buildings, and fire-resistance-rated corridors from adjacent spaces.  
• Fire partitions are permitted to extend to the membrane of a fire-resistance-rated  
floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assembly.  
• Smoke barriers are required in building areas where smoke transmission is a concern.  
• The membrane of smoke barriers must be continuous from outside wall to outside wall  
or to another smoke barrier, and from floor slab to the floor or roof deck above, to  
eliminate all avenues for smoke to travel outside of the compartment created by the  
smoke barriers.  
• Smoke partitions are intended to solely restrict the passage of smoke.  
• Horizontal assemblies are required to have a fire-resistance rating where the type of  
construction mandates protected floor and roof assemblies, and where the floor  
assembly is used to separate occupancies or create separate fire areas.  
• Penetration firestop systems are approved methods of protecting openings  
created through fire-resistance-rated walls and floors for piping and conduits.  
• A limited level of protection is permitted for penetrations of noncombustible items.  
• Both through-penetrations and membrane penetrations are regulated, typically in a  
similar fashion.  
• Joints, such as the division of the building designed for movement during a seismic  
event, must often be protected if they occur in a fire-resistance-rated vertical or  
horizontal element.  
• An opening protective refers to a fire door, or fire-protection-rated glazing, including  
the required frames, sills, anchorage, and hardware for its proper operation.  
• Table 716.1\(2\) identifies the minimum fire-protection rating for a fire door assembly  
based on the type of wall assembly in which it is installed.  
• In interior applications, fire-protection-rated glazing is limited to fire partitions and fire  
barriers having a maximum fire-resistance rating of 1 hour.  
• In addition to fire dampers and smoke dampers, ceiling radiation dampers, combination  
fire/smoke dampers, and corridor dampers are referenced in the IBC.  
• Fireblocking and draftstopping are required in combustible construction to cut off  
concealed draft openings.  
• Prescriptive methods for fire-resistance-rated construction are detailed for structural  
parts, walls and partitions, and floor and roof systems.

# INTERIOR FINISHES  
Section 802 General  
Section 803 Wall and Ceiling Finishes  
Section 804 Interior Floor Finish  
Section 805 Combustible Materials in Types I and II Construction  
Key Points  
Unfortunately, a number of building code provisions are enacted only after a disaster \(usually  
with a large loss of life\) indicates the need to regulate in a specific area. This is true of the  
interior wall and ceiling finish requirements of Chapter 8. In this case, the 1942 Cocoanut  
Grove nightclub fire in Boston, with a loss of almost 500 lives, provided the impetus to  
develop code requirements for the regulation of interior finish. Based on fire statistics, lack of  
proper control over interior finish \(and the consequent rapid spread of fire\) is second only to  
vertical spread of fire through openings in floors as a cause of loss of life during fire in  
buildings.  
The dangers of unregulated interior finish are as follows\:  
The rapid spread of fire. Rapid spread of fire presents a threat to the occupants of a  
building by either limiting or denying their use of exitways within and out of the building.  
This limitation on the use of exits can be created by\:  
1\. The rapid spread of the fire itself so that it blocks the use of exitways.  
2\. The production of large quantities of dense, black smoke \(such as smoke created by  
certain plastic materials\), which obscures the exit path and exit signs.  
The contribution of additional fuel to the fire. Unregulated finish materials have the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationpotential for adding fuel to the fire, thereby increasing its intensity and shortening the time  
available to the occupants to exit safely. However, because ASTM E84 and UL 723 do not  
require the determination of the amount of fuel contributed, the International Building Code®  
\(IBC®\) does not regulate interior finish materials on this basis  
Section 802 General  
It is the intent of the IBC to regulate the interior finish materials on walls and ceilings, as well as  
coverings applied to the floor. In addition, limitations on the use of trim, decorative materials,  
and combustible lockers are found in Section 806, with the exception of foam plastics used as  
trim or finish material. These are addressed in Chapter 26. Combustible materials are permitted  
as finish materials in buildings of any type of construction, provided the wall, ceiling, or floor  
finishes are in compliance with this chapter.  
As established in Section 803.2, it is not the intent of the IBC to regulate thin materials such  
as wallpaper that are less than 0.036 inch \(0.9 mm\) thick and are applied directly to a wall or  
ceiling surface. These thin materials behave essentially as the backing to which they are applied  
and, as a result, are not regulated. In some cases, however, repeated applications of wallpaper  
where the original materials are not removed can accumulate to a thickness of such magnitude  
that they must be regulated. The IBC, as stated in Section 803.3, also does not typically regulate  
the finish of exposed heavy-timber members complying with Sections 602.4 and 2304.11 insofar  
as this type of construction is not subject to rapid flame spread. However, such elements are  
subject to the interior finish requirements where they are in an exposed condition in interior exit  
stairways, interior exit ramps, and exit passageways.  
Section 803 Wall and Ceiling Finishes  
803.1.1 Interior wall and ceiling finish materials tested in accordance with NFPA 286. All  
interior wall and ceiling finish materials are permitted to be tested to NFPA 286 Standard  
Methods of Fire Tests for Evaluating Contribution of Wall and Ceiling Interior Finish to Room  
Fire Growth. Therefore, the criteria referencing the application of NFPA 286 are presented first  
as Section 803.1.1. Any finish material which passes NFPA 286 testing is considered as having a  
Class A flame spread rating. Since NFPA 286 does not classify materials into flame spread  
categories, the acceptance criteria for a successful test under NFPA 286 follow as Section  
803.1.1.1.  
803.1.2 Interior wall and ceiling finish materials tested in accordance with ASTM E84 or  
UL 723. Section 803.1.2 addresses testing for the determination of flame spread and smoke  
development characteristics under ASTM E84 and UL 723. This test is commonly known as the  
Steiner tunnel test. Based on the results of these tests, interior wall and ceiling materials are  
classified. These classifications are divided into three groups, Class A, Class B, and Class C.  
There is a variety of materials and conditions with other characteristics which cannot simply  
be tested to NFPA 286, ASTM E84, or UL 723; therefore, additional testing criteria are needed.  
These items are listed in Sections 803.2 through 803.12, where additional testing criteria are  
provided.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation803.5 Textile wall coverings. This section regulates carpet—as well as other textiles that are  
napped, tufted, looped, woven, or nonwoven—where applied as wall finish materials. Textile  
wall coverings present a unique hazard because of the potential for extremely rapid fire spread.  
The code provides three options for the acceptance of textiles used as interior wall finish. One  
method of testing includes the surface burning characteristics test of ASTM E84 or UL 723. The  
textile must have a flame-spread index of Class A and be protected by automatic sprinklers. A  
second option is based on the room corner test for textiles as established in NFPA 265, where the  
testing must be done in accordance with the Method B protocol. It is important that the testing be  
done in the same manner as the intended use of the textile materials. A third approach is the use  
of the ceiling and wall finish room corner test as set forth in NFPA 286. This test is also based on  
the intended application of the textile material and must include the product-mounting system.  
Where textiles are intended to be applied as ceiling finish materials, only the methods using  
ASTM E84, UL 723, and NFPA 286 are to be used.  
Where these types of materials are intended to be applied as ceiling coverings, the limitations  
on their use are similar to those for wall coverings. Although compliance with Section 803.1.1 or  
803.5.2 allow for their use, the provisions of Section 803.5.1 utilizing the NFPA 265 test are not  
to be applied.  
803.13 Interior finish requirements based on occupancy. Table 803.13 is divided based on the  
presence, or lack of, an automatic sprinkler system. Note that an extensive number of notes  
modify the general provisions of Table 803.13.  
As a general rule, interior exit stairways, interior exit ramps, and exit passageways are  
regulated at the highest level because of their importance as exit components in the means of  
egress. These types of exits permit unlimited travel distance and are typically single-directional.  
Corridors and exit access stairways are also highly regulated, but not to the extent of the higher  
level exit components. Interior finish requirements for rooms and other enclosed areas are not as  
restrictive as for exitways; however, the wall and ceiling finishes are still regulated to some  
degree.  
When it comes to occupancy groups, the high-hazard, institutional, and assembly occupancies  
typically have the most restrictive flame-spread classifications. On the other hand, utility  
occupancies have no restrictions. Using a nonsprinklered office building as an example, the  
maximum flame spread classification of finish materials, based on occupancy group and location  
within the building, is shown in Figure 803-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 803-1 Flame-spread requirements by location within a nonsprinklered office  
building.  
Based on the cooling that an automatic sprinkler system provides, the code permits a  
reduction of one classification for many of the occupancies and locations. However, this is not a  
standard reduction. The table must be referenced to identify those reductions available for  
sprinklered applications. There is also no allowance for reducing a Class C requirement to a  
lower classification based on sprinkler protection. It should be noted that the required sprinkler  
system need only be provided in those exitways or rooms where the classification reduction is  
taken, and not throughout the entire building.  
Figure 803-2 provides flame-spread classifications of woods commonly used in construction  
and finish work. A glance at the chart will show that most species of wood qualify for a Class C  
rating. There are few wood species that warrant a Class B rating, and no species is shown that  
qualifies for a Class A rating. However, there are many paints and varnishes in the market that  
manufacturers refer to as fire-retardant coatings. Because of intumescence, these paints or  
coatings bubble up or swell up under the action of flame and heat to provide an insulating  
coating on the surface of the material treated. Certain intumescent paints and varnishes can  
reduce the flame spread of combustible finishes to as low as Class A and the smoke density to  
considerably below 450. These flame-spread-reducing intumescent coatings are particularly  
useful when correcting an existing nonconforming combustible interior finish.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 803-2 Flame-spread classification of woods.  
803.14 Stability. The IBC requires that the method of fastening the finished materials to the  
interior surfaces be capable of holding the material in place for 30 minutes under a room  
temperature of 200°F \(93°C\). If there is any question as to the adequacy of the fastening,  
appropriate tests should be required to determine compliance with this provision of the code.  
803.15 Application of interior finish materials to fire-resistance-rated or noncombustible  
building elements. This section is applicable only where finish materials are applied on walls,  
ceilings, or structural elements required to have a fire-resistance rating, or where such building  
elements must be of noncombustible construction \(typically Type I or II construction\). The  
greatest concern is where interior finish is not applied directly to a backing surface, creating  
concealed spaces that provide the opportunity for fire to originate and spread without detection  
until the interior finish material has burned through. The installation of furring strips is  
permitted, provided they are installed directly against the surface of the wall, ceiling, or  
structural member. In addition, the concealed space created by the furring strips must be either  
fireblocked at maximum 8-foot \(2,438-mm\) intervals, or filled completely with a Class A,  
noncombustible, or organic material. The maximum depth of the concealed space is limited to  
1¾ inches \(44 mm\). This section is also referenced by Section 803.15.3 for fireblocking in  
heavy-timber construction.  
Where interior finish materials are set out or suspended more than the 1¾ inches \(44 mm\)  
specified in Section 803.15.1, the potential exists for the fire to gain access to the space through  
joints or imperfections and to spread along the back surface as well. In this case, the flame  
spreads at a much faster rate than on one surface, as the flame front will be able to feed on the  
material from two sides. Therefore, the provisions of Section 803.15.2 are intended to protect  
against this type of hazard. In the case where a wall is set out, the wall, including the portion that  
is set out, is required by the code to be of fire-resistance-rated construction as would be required  
by the code for the occupancy and type of construction.  
It should be noted again that the provisions of Sections 803.15.1 and 803.15.2 are applicable  
only where the walls and ceiling assemblies are required to be of either fire-resistance-rated or  
noncombustible construction. Where the walls and ceiling assemblies are of unprotected  
combustible construction, only the fireblocking provisions of Section 718.2 are applicable.  
Section 803.15.4 requires that thin materials—no more than ¼ inch \(6.4 mm\) thick—other  
than noncombustible materials, be applied directly against a noncombustible backing unless they  
are qualified by tests where the material is furred out or suspended from the noncombustible  
backing. The reason for this requirement is similar to that in Section 803.15.2. There are some  
buildings where thin paneling, such as luan plywood, is installed on walls and ceilings. When not  
installed against a noncombustible backing, these materials readily burn through and permit an  
almost uncontrolled rapid flame spread because the flame proceeds on both surfaces of the  
material.  
Section 804 Interior Floor Finish  
Floor finishes such as wood, terrazzo, marble, vinyl, and linoleum present little, if any, hazard  
that is due to the spread of fire along the floor surface. However, other flooring materials such as  
carpeting are highly regulated by the IBC because of their potential for helping to increase the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationgrowth of a fire.  
804.2 Classification. For the purpose of regulating floor finishes based on the occupancy  
designation of the area where the finishes are installed, the code identifies two classes\: Class I  
and Class II. Determined by test standard NFPA 253 or ASTM E648, the classifications are  
based on the critical radiant flux. The critical radiant flux is determined as that point where the  
heat flux level will no longer support the spread of fire. Class I is considered to have a critical  
radiant flux of 0.45 watts per square centimeter or greater, where Class II need only exceed 0.22  
watts per square centimeter. Therefore, the Class I material is more resistant to flame spread  
because of the higher heat-flux-level characteristics.  
804.4 Interior floor finish requirements. Interior floor finishes are regulated differently by the  
code based on two factors\: the occupancies in the building and where the finish materials are  
located in relationship to the means of egress. The IBC selectively requires that interior exit  
stairways and ramps, exit passageways, and corridors be provided with a floor finish exceeding  
the critical radiant flux level established by the “pill test” used in DOC \(U.S. Department of  
Commerce\) FF-1 and test standard ASTM D2859. In addition, the floor finish materials of all  
rooms or spaces unseparated from a corridor by full-height partitions are regulated in a like  
manner, as there is evidence that corridor floor coverings can propagate flame when exposed to a  
fully developed fire in a room that opens into a corridor. Those rooms that have no direct  
connection with a corridor are simply regulated for the DOC FF-1 criteria, as are rooms that are  
separated from a corridor by full-height partitions.  
The DOC FF-1 and ASTM D2859 “pill tests” require a minimum radiant flux of 0.04 watts  
per square centimeter and are used to regulate all carpeting sold in the United States. Fire tests  
have demonstrated that carpet on the floor that passes the pill test is not likely to become  
involved in a room fire until the fire has reached or approached flashover. Only those finish  
materials having a Class I or II classification may be installed in corridors, exit passageways, and  
exit enclosures of fully sprinklered Group I-1, I-2, and I-3 occupancies. The same limitation  
holds true for floors of exitways in areas of nonsprinklered buildings housing Group A, B, E, M,  
or S occupancies. In other occupancies, the interior floor finish in the listed exitways need only  
comply with DOC FF-1 or ASTM D2859 listing. The commentary above assumes the reduction  
in the classifications of floor finishes that is permitted where the building is fully sprinklered.  
Class II floor finish materials are permitted in lieu of Class I materials, whereas materials  
complying with the DOC FF-1 or ASTM D2859 “pill test” may be used instead of Class II  
materials. The entire building, and not just the area where the floor finish is located, must be  
provided with an automatic sprinkler system.  
It is important to note that all fibrous floor coverings in those occupancies and locations not  
required by the IBC to have a Class I or II classification must comply with the “pill test”  
requirements of DOC FF-1 or ASTM D2859.  
Section 805 Combustible Materials in Types I and II  
# Construction  
Where combustible flooring materials are installed in or on floors in noncombustible buildings,  
they are regulated by this section. Combustible sleepers may only be installed where the space  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbetween the fire-resistance-rated floor deck and the sleepers is completely filled with approved  
noncombustible materials or is fireblocked in the manner described in Section 718. Finish  
flooring of wood shall be attached to sleepers, which, if not imbedded, shall be appropriately  
fireblocked. As long as the wood flooring is in direct contact with a fire-resistance-rated floor,  
there is no significant hazard. However, if there is a space between the wood flooring and the  
fire-resistance-rated floor, a concealed space is created that is enclosed with combustible  
materials and provides a route for the undetected spread of fire. Therefore, the code requires that  
where wood flooring is not in direct contact with the fire-resistance-rated floor, the space be  
filled with noncombustible material or be fireblocked. Based on the controls placed on wood  
sleepers and finish flooring, it is also reasonable that combustible insulating boards be permitted  
where installed in a similar manner.  
KEY POINTS  
• Regulation of finish materials by the IBC includes those on walls and ceilings, as well  
as floor coverings.  
• Unregulated interior finish materials contribute to the rapid spread of fire, presenting a  
threat to the occupants by limiting or denying their use of exitways.  
• Interior exit stairways and exit passageways are the most highly regulated building  
elements for the application of interior finish materials, with corridors and exit access  
stairways being moderately controlled, and rooms or areas being the least-regulated  
portions of the building.  
• Installation of an automatic sprinkler system often allows a one-class reduction in the  
requirement for flame-spread classification.  
• Textile wall and ceiling coverings are more highly regulated than other finish materials  
because of the potential for extremely rapid fire spread.  
• Carpeting and similar floor covering materials are highly regulated in specific locations  
of specific occupancies.  
• In all occupancies, fibrous floor coverings must, at a minimum, comply with the  
requirements of the DOC FF-1 “pill test” or with ASTM D2859.  
• In certain occupancies, the code regulates curtains, hangings, and other decorative  
materials as to their flame resistance and limits their use.

Key Points  
Chapter 9 provides requirements for three distinct fire protection systems considered vital for  
the creation of a safe building environment. The first of these systems is intended to control  
and limit fires, protect building occupants, and assist fire fighters with fire-fighting operations.  
Included are fire-extinguishing systems and standpipe systems. The detection and notification  
of an emergency condition are addressed by the second system. Manual fire alarms, automatic  
fire detection, emergency alarm systems, and mass notification are included in this group. The  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthird system is intended to control smoke migration. Included are design and installation  
standards for smoke control systems, as well as smoke and heat vents and mechanical smoke  
removal systems. In addition to the provisions for fire protection systems, criteria are provided  
to increase the efficiency and safety of fire department personnel during emergency  
operations. Topics addressed include emergency responder safety features, fire command  
centers, fire department connections, and fire pump rooms  
Section 901 General  
It is the intent of Chapter 9 to require fire protection systems in those buildings and with those  
uses that through experience have been shown to present hazards requiring the additional  
protection provided by fire protection systems. The installation, repair, operation, and  
maintenance of such systems are based on the provisions of the IBC® and the International Fire  
Code® \(IFC®\). Furthermore, it is the intent of the code to prescribe standards for those systems  
that are required. However, there are times when the installation of a fire protection system is not  
based on a code mandate. Such fire protection and life safety systems may be installed as a  
requirement of the insurance carrier, a choice of the designer, or a desire of the owner. In such  
situations, the nonrequired system must still meet the provisions of the code. Once fire protection  
and life safety systems are provided to some degree, it is expected that the system is properly  
installed and functional.  
An exception to this section permits a system or any portion of that system that is not required  
by the code to be installed for partial or complete protection, provided that the installation meets  
the code requirements. As an example, fire sprinkler protection may be provided only in a  
specific area of a building, based on a request by the owner rather than on a requirement of the  
code. Although the sprinkler system must be installed in accordance with the proper design  
standard \(in most cases NFPA 13\), it is not necessary that the sprinkler system extends into other  
areas of the building.  
More than likely, however, a fire protection system is used to take advantage of modifications  
to other code requirements. Under these conditions, the fire protection system is considered a  
required system and is subject to all of the requirements imposed by the IBC and IFC.  
901.6.2 Integrated testing. There are many buildings that will be provided with more than one  
fire protection or life safety system. For example, a smoke detection system is used to detect  
smoke and activate the operation of an automatic fire-extinguishing system, release door hold-  
open devices, and shut down the ventilation system. Larger buildings typically have more of  
these interconnected systems, and as the number of systems increases, so does the complexity of  
the operation. This section requires that when there are two or more systems, the entire operation  
must be tested at the time of acceptance testing. A reference to NFPA 4,  
“Standard for Integrated  
Fire Protection and Life Safety System Testing,  
” is included which provides guidance on testing  
of these multiple systems.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 901-1 Fire areas.  
901.7 Fire areas. The fire area concept is based on a time-tested approach to limiting the spread  
of fire in a building. Through the use of fire-resistive elements, compartments can be created that  
are intended to contain a fire for a prescribed period of time. The floor area that occurs within  
each such compartment is considered to be the fire area. By definition, a fire area is the aggregate  
floor area enclosed and bounded by fire walls, fire barriers, exterior walls, and/or horizontal  
assemblies of a building. See Figure 901-1. In addition, any areas beyond the exterior wall that  
are covered with a floor or roof above, such as a canopy extending from the building, are  
considered part of the building for fire area purposes. This approach is consistent with the  
determination of building area in Chapter 2. An example is shown in Application Example 901-  
1\. Through the isolation of a fire condition to a single fire area through the use of fire separation  
elements having significant fire-resistance ratings, only that portion of the building within the  
fire area is considered as risk due to a single fire incident.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 901-1  
The use of fire areas as a fire protection tool is limited almost exclusively to the requirements  
for automatic sprinkler systems. Other fire protection systems, such as fire alarm systems, are for  
the most part regulated by methods that are not based on the fire area concept. Even within the  
automatic sprinkler provisions of Section 903.2, only a portion of the requirements use the fire  
area approach as an alternative means of protection. The fire area methodology set forth in the  
IBC, applicable only in limited occupancy groups under limited conditions, allows for the  
omission of automatic sprinkler protection.  
As an example, the provisions of Section 903.2.3, Item 1, require that a fire area containing a  
Group E occupancy that exceeds 12,000 square feet \(1,115 m²\) in floor area be provided with an  
automatic sprinkler system. Conversely, where the fire area size does not exceed the established  
threshold of 12,000 square feet \(1,115 m²\), a sprinkler system is not required unless mandated by  
another code provision. Where the building under consideration is limited to a maximum of  
12,000 square feet \(1,115 m²\), it can be viewed as a single fire area, and no sprinkler system is  
mandated. However, where the building exceeds 12,000 square feet \(1,115 m²\) in floor area, two  
or more fire areas must be established to eliminate the fire sprinkler requirement. Table 707.3.10  
is referenced because it sets forth the minimum required level of fire resistance necessary to  
create an adequate fire separation between the fire areas that are established. In the example, and  
assuming the Group E building is 20,000 square feet \(1,858 m²\) in total floor area, at least two  
fire areas must be created as an alternative to sprinkler protection. Neither of the two fire areas is  
allowed to exceed 12,000 square feet \(1,115 m²\), and Table 707.3.10 indicates that the minimum  
fire separation between the two fire areas must be 2 hours. Therefore, a minimum 2-hour fire-  
resistance-rated fire wall, fire barrier, or horizontal assembly, or a combination of these elements,  
would be required. It is important to note that, regardless of the floor area of the Group E fire  
area, sprinkler protection would still be required if the occupant load of the fire area is 300 or  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmore \(Section 903.2.3, \#3\) or if the fire area is not located solely on the level of exit discharge  
\(Section 903.2.3, \#2\).  
A similar approach is taken in a mixed-occupancy building where the multiple fire areas are  
of different occupancy classifications. The minimum required fire-resistance rating for the  
separation between the fire areas would also be based on the requirements of Table 707.3.10. For  
example, where a building contains a 10,000-square-foot \(929-m²\) Group M occupancy and a  
6,000-square-foot \(558-m²\) Group F-1 occupancy, the minimum fire-resistive separation  
between the Group M fire area and the Group F-1 fire area would be 3 hours. Although the  
Group M requirement in Table 707.3.10 only mandates a 2-hour separation, a minimum 3-hour  
fire separation is required for a Group F-1 occupancy. For further information, see Application  
Example 901-2 and the discussion of Table 707.3.10.  
Section 902 Fire Pump and Riser Room Size  
The IBC does not require the construction of a fire pump room or fire sprinkler riser room. But  
where such a room is constructed, specific criteria for its design and construction are provided.  
The intent of the code requirements is to provide protection for the equipment within these  
rooms since they are critical to the fire- and life-safety systems in the building. This section  
would be used in conjunction with Section 913 regarding fire pumps. See the discussion of  
Section 913 for further information.  
Application Example 901-2  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation902.1 Pump and riser room size. The equipment in the fire pump room or fire sprinkler riser  
room must be accessible for maintenance, as well as its use and operation during a fire event.  
This section requires that adequate working clearance be provided around all stationary  
equipment. This would include items such as the fire pump and the control panel for the fire  
pump, the jockey pump and control panel for the jockey pump, the control valves on the  
sprinkler system risers, and any monitoring or supervision equipment. The area must also be  
large enough to allow for removal and replacement of the largest component in the room. This  
provision applies to doorways and hallways that provide the path to the exterior.  
The fire pump room or riser room must be provided permanent lighting. Permanently installed  
environmental controls are required to maintain the air temperature above 40°F \(4°C\). Even  
though water does not freeze until the temperature is below 32°F \(0°C\), ice crystals begin to form  
and the water becomes like a slush as the temperature nears freezing. Maintaining the room  
temperature at or above 40°F \(4°C\) provides for some safety margin to protect the water in the  
fire pump, sprinkler riser, and associated piping.  
Section 903 Automatic Sprinkler Systems  
In general, automatic sprinkler systems are required when certain special features and hazards of  
specific buildings, areas, and occupancies are such that the additional protection provided by  
sprinkler systems is warranted.  
In addition, there occasionally are inadequate numbers and sizes of openings in the exterior  
walls from which a fire may be fought from the exterior of the building. The provisions requiring  
sprinklers in these so-called windowless buildings apply to all buildings, regardless of  
occupancy, except for Group U occupancies.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 903-1 Examples of fire sprinkler requirements.  
There are four general situations in which fire sprinkler systems are to be provided within a  
building. An automatic sprinkler system may be required throughout the building, throughout a  
fire area, throughout the occupancy, or only in the specific room or space where sprinkler  
protection is necessary. Examples are depicted in Figure 903-1.  
1\. Throughout the building. There are numerous applications of the code that require the  
entire building to be sprinklered, either mandated because of a code requirement or used  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. 3. 4. as a substitute for other fire- and life-safety features. Examples include the requirement  
for sprinklers throughout all buildings containing a Group I fire area per Section 903.2.6  
and the elimination of corridor fire protection in some occupancies based on Table  
1020.2, Footnote c. The extent of required sprinkler protection in Group A occupancies is  
described in a different manner, but quite often results in a fully sprinklered condition.  
Initially, the entire story containing a Group A occupancy must be provided with sprinkler  
protection where it exceeds the limits established by Sections 903.2.1.1 through 903.2.1.4.  
However, as mandated in each of those sections, the fire sprinkler system must also be  
provided on all stories between the Group A occupancy and the level of exit discharge,  
including the level of exit discharge. This will commonly result in a requirement that the  
entire building be provided with an automatic sprinkler system. Additional commentary is  
provided in the discussion of Section 903.2.1.  
Throughout a fire area. In Section 903.2, a variety of provisions require only those fire  
areas that exceed a certain size or occupant load, or are located in a specific portion of the  
structure to be sprinklered. The sprinkler requirements based on fire area include the  
provisions of Section 903.2.3 for Group E occupancies and Section 903.2.4.1 for Group  
F-1 woodworking operations.  
Throughout an occupancy. A third variation of sprinkler mandates occurs in those  
mixed-occupancy buildings containing a Group H-2, H-3, or H-4 occupancy. The code  
only mandates that the sprinkler system be provided in the Group H portion, not the entire  
building. Because all other occupancies in a mixed-occupancy building must be  
appropriately isolated from the Group H occupancy because of the separated occupancies  
provisions of Section 508.4, the result is basically a requirement to sprinkler the Group H  
compartment.  
Specific rooms or areas. Occasionally, only a specific portion of the building requires  
the protection provided by a sprinkler system. The sprinkler addresses the particular  
hazard that occurs at possibly only a single location. For example, the allowance for a  
reduction in the flame-spread classification of interior finishes from Table 803.13 is based  
on sprinkler protection in the room, area, or exitway where the finish under consideration  
is installed. In addition, Table 509.1 addresses incidental uses within a building and for  
most of the hazards provides an option on mitigating the hazard. For example, a  
refrigerant machinery room must be protected with either a fire sprinkler system, or it can  
be separated from the remainder of the building by 1-hour fire-resistance-rated  
construction. Where the sprinkler option is applied, only the refrigerant machinery room  
is required to be sprinklered to comply with Table 509.1. Additional commentary is  
provided in the discussion of Section 509.1.  
903.1.1 Alternative protection. Where an automatic sprinkler system is addressed in the IBC,  
alternative automatic fire-extinguishing systems are acceptable, provided they are installed in  
accordance with approved standards. These systems, regulated by Section 904, include fire-  
extinguishing systems required by the IFC and systems installed as a design alternative. This is  
one of the few provisions in the IBC where approval must come from someone other than the  
building official. Although the building official is almost always charged with making any  
decisions regarding the building code, the fire code official is typically better able to evaluate  
and determine the appropriateness of an alternative fire-extinguishing system. It is important to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationnote that where an automatic sprinkler system is recognized by the code for the purpose of an  
exception or reduction to a requirement, the use of an alternative fire-extinguishing system will  
not provide such a benefit. See Section 904.2.1.  
903.2 Where required. It is the intent of this section to specify those occupancies and locations  
where automatic sprinkler systems are required. A fire-extinguishing system is a system that  
discharges an approved fire-extinguishing agent such as water, dry chemical powder, aqueous  
foam, or carbon dioxide onto, or in, the area of a fire. A fire sprinkler system is a specialized fire-  
extinguishing system that discharges water. The code specifies a fire sprinkler system in this  
section, as it is the intent of the code that water be applied and not one of the other extinguishing  
agents. Generally, water is the most effective extinguishing agent for fires. Only where water  
creates problems, such as in magnesium or calcium carbide storage areas, would some other type  
of extinguishing agent be required. The allowance for the installation of a system other than an  
automatic sprinkler system is subject to approval by the fire code official. It is important to note  
that Section 904.2.1 indicates that where an automatic fire-extinguishing system is installed as an  
alternative to automatic sprinkler system protection, it is not permitted to be used for the  
purposes of exceptions or reductions allowed by other code provisions. Alternative automatic  
fire-extinguishing systems are addressed in the discussion of Section 904.  
Fire areas. Most of the requirements of this section are based on the concept of fire areas.  
Where a fire area exceeds a specified size, is located in a certain portion of the building, or  
exceeds a specified occupant load, the code often requires the installation of an automatic  
sprinkler system to address the increased hazards and concerns that exist. The provisions for fire  
areas can be found in various sections of the IBC. The definition of “fire area” is located in  
Chapter 2. A fire area is “the aggregate floor area enclosed and bounded by fire walls, fire  
barriers, exterior walls or fire-resistance-rated horizontal assemblies of a building.  
” Complete  
isolation and separation of a portion of a building from all other building areas is created through  
the use of fire-resistance-rated construction and opening protectives. The total floor area within  
the enclosed area, including the floor area of any mezzanines or basements, is considered the size  
of the fire area. See Application Example 903-1. It is also important to note that “areas of the  
building not provided with surrounding walls shall be included in the fire area if such areas are  
included within the horizontal projections of the roof or floor next above.  
”  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 903-1  
Where fire walls are used, Section 503.1 indicates that each portion of the structure separated  
by fire walls is considered a separate building, but only for the purposes of building height,  
building area, and separating types of construction. A fire wall could be used to separate fire  
areas, but it does not create separate buildings for the purpose of applying sprinkler system  
requirements. See Application Example 903-2. The fire-resistance rating of the wall and the fire-  
protective ratings of any openings in the fire wall are identified in Tables 706.4 and 716.1\(2\).  
Also see the discussion of Section 706.1 where the fire wall separates different occupancies.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 903-2  
Fire barriers and fire-resistance-rated horizontal assemblies may also be used to create fire  
areas, provided the fire-resistance-rated construction totally separates one interior area from  
another. In order to determine the minimum fire-resistance rating of the vertical and horizontal  
elements, the occupancy classifications of the areas being separated must be identified. Table  
707.3.10 is then referenced to determine the minimum fire-resistance rating of the separation.  
The use of this table is applicable to both single-occupancy and mixed-occupancy buildings, as  
illustrated in Application Example 903-3. Where the fire area separation occurs between two fire  
areas of the same occupancy, the hourly rating established by Table 707.3.10 for that single  
occupancy classification is applied. If the fire areas contain different occupancy classifications,  
the controlling fire-resistance rating of the fire barrier or horizontal assembly separating the  
occupancies is based on the higher of the ratings as established by Table 707.3.10 for the  
occupancies involved. For further information, see the discussions of Section 901.7 and Table  
707.3.10.  
Because the majority of sprinkler provisions are based on the size of the fire area, it is some  
times possible for the designer to eliminate the requirement for sprinklers by reducing the floor  
area within the surrounding fire-resistance-rated construction. The use of fire walls or fire  
barriers and fire-resistance-rated horizontal assemblies can subdivide a structure into smaller,  
less hazardous areas that are of such a size that sprinklers are not necessary. See Application  
Example 903-4. This concept of compartmentation has been used in building codes for decades  
as an effective method of reducing the loss of life and property in fires.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 903-3  
The exception to Section 903.2 eliminates the sprinkler requirement in rooms or areas in  
telecommunications facilities dedicated solely for essential telecommunications and power  
equipment. Alternative protection is provided through the required installation of an automatic  
smoke detection system, as well as appropriately rated separation from other areas of the  
building.  
903.2.1 Group A. Because of the potentially high occupant load and density anticipated in  
Group A occupancies, coupled with the occupants’ probable lack of familiarity with the means  
of egress system, various assembly occupancies must be protected by an automatic sprinkler  
system. Where an automatic sprinkler system is required for a Group A-1, A-2, A-3, or A-4  
occupancy, the system must be installed throughout the entire story where the Group A  
occupancy is located. In addition, where the Group A-1, A-2, A-3, or A-4 occupancy is located  
on a story other than the level of exit discharge, that story and all stories between the Group A  
occupancy, to and including the level\(s\) of exit discharge must be sprinklered as well. By  
expanding the areas of the building required to be protected by an automatic sprinkler system  
beyond just the assembly areas, the code provides protection adjacent to the Group A areas as  
well as throughout the means of egress. Figures 903-2 and 903-3 illustrate these fundamental  
provisions.  
It is important to note that where multiple fire areas containing Group A-1, A-2, A-3, or A-4  
occupancies exist, additional provisions apply as addressed in the discussion of Section  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation903.2.1.7.  
903.2.1.1 Group A-1. The combination of highly concentrated occupant loads, high numbers of  
occupants, reduced lighting levels, and potentially high fuel loads create a level of hazard that  
justifies the need for sprinkler protection. Therefore, fire areas containing theaters and similar  
assembly uses intended for the viewing of motion pictures or the performing arts shall be  
provided with an automatic sprinkler system where any one of the following conditions exists\:  
Application Example 903-4  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 903-2 Multi-story Group A sprinkler requirements.  
Figure 903-3 Example of single story Group A sprinkler requirements.  
1\. The fire area containing the Group A-1 occupancy exceeds 12,000 square feet \(1,115 m²\).  
2\. The occupant load of the fire area exceeds 299.  
3\. The fire area is located on any floor level other than that of the exit discharge.  
It should also be noted that any fire area containing a multitheater complex, defined as two or  
more theaters served by a common lobby, shall be provided with a sprinkler system throughout  
the story.  
As addressed in the discussion of Section 903.2.1, the sprinkler protection required by Section  
903.2.1.1 must extend beyond the Group A fire area to include the entire story of the building, as  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwell as any stories from the Group A occupancy to and including the level\(s\) of exit discharge.  
903.2.1.2 Group A-2. Fire areas housing uses intended for food or drink consumption are  
regulated for sprinkler protection at a higher level than other enclosed assembly occupancies.  
Even where the occupant load is not excessive, the hazards associated with such uses warrant the  
protection provided by an automatic sprinkler system. Oftentimes, the consumption of alcohol  
beverages by the building’s occupants creates an environment more likely to be unsafe. The  
reduced lighting levels in some uses, along with the probability of loose chairs and tables, also  
increase the risk for obstructed egress. The record of casualties during fires in buildings housing  
night-clubs, casino gaming areas, restaurants, and similar types of uses demonstrates the need for  
the additional protection provided by fire sprinklers or, alternatively, the separation of the use  
into smaller compartments. The code intends that fire areas exceeding 5,000 square feet \(464 m²\)  
that contain Group A-2 uses be provided with an automatic sprinkler system, as well as such uses  
having an aggregate occupant load within the fire area of 100 or more, or where the fire area is  
located on a floor level other than the level of exit discharge.  
As addressed in the discussion of Section 903.2.1, the sprinkler protection required by Section  
903.2.1.2 must extend beyond the Group A fire area to include the entire story of the building, as  
well as any stories from the Group A occupancy to and including the level\(s\) of exit discharge.  
903.2.1.3 Group A-3. The sprinkler threshold for a Group A-3 occupancy is identical to that for  
a Group A-1 occupancy. As such, where any fire area in a Group A-3 occupancy exceeds 12,000  
square feet \(1,115 m²\), where the fire area has an occupant load greater than 299, or where the  
assembly occupancy is located on any story other than the exit discharge level, an automatic  
sprinkler system is required. In applying the provisions of this section, it is important to note that  
the occupant load threshold is based on the number of people within the entire fire area, not just  
in each assembly room. See Application Example 903-5.  
The discussion of Section 903.2.1 addresses how the sprinkler protection required by Section  
903.2.1.3 must extend beyond the Group A fire area to include the entire story of the building, as  
well as any stories from the Group A occupancy to and including the level\(s\) of exit discharge.  
The code requirements for these types of uses, specifically for exhibition and display rooms,  
can be strongly attributed to the McCormick Place fire in Chicago on January 16, 1967.  
McCormick Place was not sprinklered and consisted of three levels, including a main exhibit  
area of 320,000 square feet \(29,728 m²\) on the upper level. Both the upper and lower levels were  
in the final stages of readiness for a housewares exhibition and were heavily laden with  
combustibles when the fire broke out. The fire was reported to have originated in the storage area  
behind an exhibit booth on the upper level. The upper level was almost totally destroyed, and  
considerable damage occurred to the lower level.  
Ordinarily, assembly occupancies are considered to have a very low fire loading; however, the  
need for built-in fire suppression for an assembly uses that house exhibitions or displays was  
clearly demonstrated by the McCormick Place fire. Display booths are most often constructed  
with combustible materials, and the storage area behind the booths is a receptacle for  
combustible materials and packing boxes. Thus, without built-in fire extinguishing systems, the  
large quantities of combustible materials and large areas combine to create an excessive hazard.  
Many other assembly occupancies classified as Group A-3 also present significant fire loading  
such as art galleries, libraries, and museums. Therefore, sprinkler protection is beneficial for all  
large Group A-3 occupancies.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 903-5  
903.2.1.4 Group A-4. The fire sprinkler requirements for Group A-4 occupancies \(those  
assembly uses provided with spectator seating for the viewing of indoor activities and sporting  
events\) are identical to the provisions for Group A-1 and A-3 uses. See Section 903.2.1.3 for a  
discussion of the sprinkler requirements.  
903.2.1.5 Group A-5. The fire loading in stadiums and grandstands is typically quite low except  
for specific accessory areas such as concession stands, storage and equipment rooms, press  
boxes, and ticket offices. Therefore, assembly occupancies classified as Group A-5 do not  
require the installation of an automatic sprinkler system except for those enclosed support areas  
where\:  
• the area exceeds 1,000 square feet \(93 m²\) in floor area, or  
• the area does not exceed 1,000 square feet \(93 m²\), but it is not separated from the  
remainder of the facility by 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction as required in  
Section 1030.1.1.1.  
The limitation of 1,000 square feet \(93 m²\) is based on the floor area of each individual area  
and not on the aggregate area of all such spaces. Where such accessory spaces are of a  
considerable size, the hazards posed by the potentially large quantities of combustible materials  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcan be reduced where such areas are sprinklered.  
903.2.1.6 Assembly occupancies on roofs. Where a large Group A occupancy is located on the  
roof of a building other than a parking garage of noncombustible construction, all floor levels  
below the occupied roof must be sprinklered as illustrated in Figure 903-4. The sprinkler system  
is required where the occupant load exceeds 100 for Group A-2 occupancies, or 300 for all other  
Group A occupancies. The sprinkler protection shall extend to, and include, the level of exit  
discharge. Whether building occupants are located on an upper story or on the roof, they are  
exposed to a similar hazard as they travel down through the building to the discharge level. It  
should be noted that this provision does not require the roof to be sprinklered or provided with  
any alternative fire-extinguishing system.  
Figure 903-4 Assembly use on roof.  
The application of this provision should not be extended to other requirements of the code.  
For example, the occupied roof is not considered as building area, fire area, or a story.  
Therefore, even though an occupied roof is viewed as being an assembly occupancy, the  
limitations for allowable area and many other code provisions would not apply. Note that the  
height limits as regulated by Section 504 for allowable number of stories are regulated in a  
special manner as described in the discussion of Section 503.1.4.  
903.2.1.7 Multiple fire areas. The option of compartmentalizing Group A occupancies into  
separate fire areas simply to avoid any sprinkler requirement is limited in its application. Where  
the fire areas share a common egress system and the combined occupant load of the Group A fire  
areas exceeds an occupant load of 299, sprinkler protection is required in accordance with  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSection 903.2.1.  
Figure 903-5 depicts a condition where a sprinkler system is required even though multiple  
complying fire areas have been provided. An occupant load of 400 must be assigned to the  
corridor based upon the full contributing occupant loads of the Group A occupancies. Note that  
for purposes of this provision, 100 percent of the occupant loads of the Group A-2 and A-3  
spaces must be assigned to the corridor because partial occupant loads are not to be considered.  
Figure 903-5 Multiple Group A fire areas example.  
903.2.2 Ambulatory care facilities. As a general rule, Group B occupancies do not require a  
sprinkler system based solely on their occupancy classification. However, Section 903.2.2  
mandates that a Group B ambulatory care facility be provided with an automatic sprinkler system  
when either of the following conditions exists at any time\:  
• Four or more care recipients are incapable of self-preservation, or  
• One or more care recipients who are incapable of self-preservation are located at other  
than the level of exit discharge.  
Although such facilities are generally regarded as moderate in hazard level due to their office-  
like conditions, additional hazards are typically created due to the presence of individuals who  
are temporarily rendered incapable of self-preservation due to the application of nerve blocks,  
sedation, or anesthesia. While the occupants may walk in and walk out the same day with a quick  
recovery time after surgery, there is a period of time where a potentially large number of people  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcould require physical assistance in case of an emergency that would require evacuation or  
relocation. The installation of an automatic sprinkler provides an important safeguard that  
enables the moderate-hazard classification of Group B.  
The sprinkler system, when required, must extend throughout the entire story on which the  
ambulatory care facility is located. In addition, in multistory buildings where ambulatory care is  
provided below the exit discharge level, the sprinkler system must be installed on those stories  
between the level of ambulatory care and the level of exit discharge, inclusive. Where the  
ambulatory care facility is located above the first floor, the code stipulates that the automatic  
sprinkler system be provided on all floors below. This would include a basement even though the  
level of exit discharge may be above the basement level. See Figure 903-6. Open parking  
garages located below the ambulatory care facility are not required to be sprinklered due to their  
limited contribution to the fire load.  
Figure 903-6 Group B ambulatory care facility.  
903.2.3 Group E. History has shown that educational occupancies perform quite well when it  
comes to fire- and life-safety concerns. Much of this can be attributed to the continuous control  
and supervision that takes place within schools, as well as the students’ knowledge of egress  
responsibilities in case of a fire or other emergency. However, because of the potential for  
moderate to high combustible loading, fire areas in Group E occupancies that exceed 12,000  
square feet \(1,115 m²\) in floor area must be provided with an automatic sprinkler system. In  
addition, fire sprinklers are required for Group E fire areas that occur above or below the level of  
exit discharge, as well as those fire areas that have an occupant load more than 299. Of particular  
note is that, unlike the requirement for sprinklered Group A occupancies, the sprinkler protection  
is only required within the applicable Group E fire area and need not extend to other portions of  
the story or building.  
903.2.4 Group F-1. Without an automatic sprinkler system to limit the size of a fire, the fire can  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationspread very quickly to other portions of the structure. This is particularly true for large floor-area  
buildings containing combustible materials such as manufacturing facilities, warehouses, and  
retail sales buildings. The IBC requires an automatic sprinkler system to be installed throughout  
the entire building if it contains a Group F-1 occupancy and the fire area containing the Group F-  
1 exceeds 12,000 square feet \(1,115 m²\). A fire sprinkler system is also required where the  
building housing the Group F-1 occupancy is four stories or more in height or has an aggregate  
of Group F-1 fire areas in the building of more than 24,000 square feet \(2,230 m²\). The aggregate  
Group F-1 fire area would also include the floor area of any mezzanines involved. The 24,000-  
square-foot \(2,230-m²\) limitation would also be applicable in both single-story and multistory  
structures.  
The subsections of 903.2.4 address the specific hazards of woodworking operations and the  
manufacture of distilled spirits, upholstered furniture, or mattresses. Due to the increased fire  
hazard these uses will either always require the sprinkler protection, or the threshold for the  
protection is reduced well below the general provisions for a Group F-1 occupancy. Since the  
sprinkler is addressing a specific hazard, the system only needs to be installed throughout the fire  
area as opposed to applying throughout the entire building. These provisions allow for additional  
compartmentation in lieu of sprinkler protection or installing the system only in the area to  
address the increased hazard. However, once the general limits of Section 903.2.4 are exceeded,  
the sprinkler systems would be required to extend throughout the building. The 2,500-square-  
foot \(232-m²\) threshold for upholstered furniture or mattresses, although arbitrary in nature,  
represents a reasonable top-end limit where sprinkler protection is not required. It is also  
consistent with the sprinkler requirements of IFC Table 3206.2 addressing high-piled  
combustible storage of high-hazard commodities in buildings not typically accessible to the  
public.  
903.2.4.1 Woodworking operations. Because of the special hazards involving combustible  
dusts and waste created during woodworking operations such as sanding and sawing, this section  
requires that an automatic fire-sprinkler system be installed in Group F-1 fire areas containing  
woodworking occupancies where the floor area of such operations exceeds 2,500 square feet  
\(232 m²\). Where equipment, machinery, or appliances that generate finely divided combustible  
waste or that use finely divided combustible materials are a portion of a woodworking operation,  
the size of the higher hazard operations is strictly limited unless sprinklers are installed. An  
example of this provision is shown in Figure 903-7. The provision is based on the floor area  
where the sanding, sawing, and similar operations occur, not necessarily the floor area of the  
entire woodworking operation. For example, any floor area devoted solely to the assembly of  
wood cabinetry would not be included in the determination. However, because these types of  
operations occur quite often as an integral part of the overall woodworking activities, rather than  
isolated in their own room or area, some means of regulating and controlling the hazard should  
be provided.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 903-7 Woodworking operations.  
903.2.5 Group H occupancies. Group H occupancies are high-hazard uses, and one special  
feature is that, in addition to presenting a local hazard within the building, it has a potential for  
presenting a high level of hazard to the surrounding properties. Therefore, the code requires  
sprinkler protection for all Group H occupancies. Note that the sprinkler system is not  
necessarily required throughout the entire building that contains a Group H-2, H-3, or H-4  
occupancy. Only the Group H occupancies must be provided with a sprinkler system. In the case  
of a Group H-1 occupancy, no other occupancies are permitted in the same building. Therefore, a  
building housing a Group H-1 occupancy must be sprinklered throughout. In addition, buildings  
containing Group H-5 occupancies require sprinklers throughout the entire building as well as in  
the Group H-5 areas. This requirement is based on the original premise that the primary  
protection feature of this highly protected use is the automatic sprinkler system. For the purpose  
of sprinkler-system design, all areas of a Group H-5 are considered Ordinary Hazard Group 2,  
except for storage rooms with dispensing operations, which are considered Extra Hazard Group  
2.  
While not always classified as a Group H occupancy, buildings where pyroxylin plastics are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmanufactured, stored, or used in quantities greater than 100 pounds \(45 kg\) are required to be  
protected with an automatic sprinkler system. Pyroxylin plastics present a high hazard and are  
extremely flammable, as such those areas where these materials occur in larger quantities must  
be protected with fire sprinklers.  
903.2.6 Group I. Because the mobility of the occupants of Group I occupancies is greatly  
diminished \(in the case of hospitals and detention facilities, the self-preservation is essentially  
nonexistent\), the code requires an NFPA 13 automatic sprinkler system throughout any building  
where a Group I fire area exists. For supervised residential facilities classified as Group I-1,  
Condition 1 occupancies, allowances are made for the use of an approved NFPA 13R system.  
The similarities between this Group I use and those uses classified as Group R justify the  
reduction in sprinkler protection.  
Exception 2 provides the only instance in which a building containing a Group I occupancy is  
not required to be provided with some type of automatic sprinkler system. Day-care facilities  
classified as Group I-4 occupancies are not required to be sprinklered where the day-care  
operations only occur at the level of exit discharge and every room where care is provided has an  
exit door that leads directly to the exterior. This allowance is similar in some respects to the  
allowance in Section 308.5.1 where day-care operations consistent with a Group I-4  
classification may be classified as a Group E occupancy.  
903.2.7 Group M. The typical American supermarket evolved during the construction boom that  
followed World War II. At that time, the typical supermarket consisted of a one-story building of  
moderately large area, e.g., 15,000 to 25,000 square feet \(1,394 to 2,323 m²\). During the 1950s,  
fire statistics indicated that large-area supermarkets without sprinkler protection were subject to a  
larger proportion of fires than were usually attributable to this use in the past. As a result,  
building codes began requiring sprinklers in larger retail sales occupancies. The present  
requirements, detailed in the discussion of Section 903.2.4, are based on any of three factors\: the  
size of the fire area, the number of stories, or the combined fire area on all stories. In addition,  
reference to the IFC is made for sprinkler protection in mercantile buildings where merchandise  
is placed in high-piled or rack storage. The installation of an automatic sprinkler system is also  
mandated in any Group M fire area that is used for the display and sale of upholstered furniture  
or mattresses where the floor area devoted to such goods exceeds 5,000 square feet \(464 m²\).  
Thus it would allow the fire area to exceed 5,000 square feet \(464 m2\) without sprinkler  
protection provided the floor area used for the display and sale of the upholstered furniture and  
mattresses does not exceed the 5,000 square-foot \(464 m2\) threshold. The requirement does not  
apply to the display and sale of furniture that is not upholstered, such as furniture constructed  
entirely of wood, plastic, or metal. Similar provisions are established for Group F-1 and S-1  
occupancies where upholstered furniture or mattresses are manufactured or stored, however the  
sprinkler thresholds for Group M and S-1 occupancies are based only on the actual “area used”  
while the Group F-1 provisions are based on the entire fire area size. See the discussion of  
Section 903.2.4 for further commentary. The increased area threshold for sprinkler protection in  
Group M occupancies is based in part on an anticipated lower density of goods within a display  
area.  
903.2.8 Group R. In hotels, apartment buildings, dormitories, and other Group R occupancies,  
occupants may be asleep at the time of a fire, and may experience delay and disorientation in  
trying to reach safety. In addition, fire hazards in residential uses are often unknown to most  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationoccupants of the building, as they are created within an individual dwelling unit or guestroom.  
This helps to explain why these occupancies have a poor fire record when it comes to injury and  
loss of life. Annually, the largest loss of life occurs in Group R occupancies. The National Fire  
Protection Association \(NFPA\) reports that between 2014 and 2018 an average of 2,844 civilians  
perished each year as a result of fires in the United States. Of those fatalities, 96 percent occurred  
in residential occupancies. Therefore, an automatic sprinkler system is required throughout any  
building containing a Group R occupancy. The sprinkler requirement applies to the entire  
building and not just the fire area containing the Group R occupancy.  
903.2.9 Group S-1. In a manner consistent with that for Group F-1 and M occupancies,  
buildings containing combustible storage and warehousing uses must be provided with an  
automatic sprinkler system where the floor area or story level exceeds the specified threshold.  
The sprinkler requirement is based on the probable presence of large amounts of combustible  
materials, typically arranged in a highly concentrated manner.  
Although the storage of commercial trucks, buses, and similar motor vehicles is typically  
regulated under the provisions of Section 903.2.10.1, there are situations where the parking of  
such vehicles occurs in the same area with other Group S-1 uses. Therefore, these multipurpose  
spaces, such as fire station bays and public works facilities, are more appropriately classified as  
Group S-1 occupancies. In such cases, a more restrictive threshold of 5,000 square feet \(464 m²\)  
is used to require sprinkler protection. By definition, a commercial motor vehicle is used to  
transport passengers or property and either has a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds  
\(4,540 kg\) or more, or is designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver.  
The storage of distilled spirits, wine, upholstered furniture or mattresses pose an increased fire  
load. Therefore additional protection requirements exist. The storage of upholstered furniture and  
mattresses poses much the same hazard as in buildings where such goods are manufactured or  
displayed. However, the sprinkler requirements are not totally consistent with those for Group F-  
1 and M occupancies where upholstered furniture or mattresses are present. As with Group M  
occupancies, the sprinkler requirements for Group S-1 storage occupancies are based only on the  
floor area where upholstered furniture and mattresses are stored, not the size of the entire storage  
space or fire area.  
903.2.9.1 Repair garages. The unique hazards associated with vehicle repair garages may be  
addressed in part through the installation of an automatic sprinkler system. However, the  
requirement for sprinklers is limited only to those repair garages that present a high level of  
concern based on size or location. By locating the repair garage above grade in a building of one  
or two stories, the size of the fire area containing the garage becomes the controlling factor in the  
determination of whether or not a sprinkler system is required. Where there is vehicle parking in  
the basement of a building used for vehicle repair, the building must be sprinklered regardless of  
fire area size. The sprinkler requirement is applicable even where the repair activity occurs only  
above the basement level. In buildings where commercial motor vehicles are repaired, the  
threshold for sprinkler protection is consistent with that established in Section 903.2.10.1 for  
commercial parking garages.  
903.2.10 Group S-2 parking garages. Because the bulk of the uses designated as Group S-2  
occupancies present very low fire-load potential, there is generally no requirement for these low-  
hazard occupancies to be sprinklered. However, where the Group S-2 portion of a building is an  
parking garage, the hazard level is increased. There is a need to protect other uses housed above  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationan enclosed parking garage; thus, a Group S-2 enclosed parking garage is required to be  
sprinklered where the garage is located below another occupancy. In fact, in such a situation the  
entire building must be sprinklered, regardless of the size of the garage itself. There is an  
exception to the sprinkler requirement where an enclosed parking garage is located beneath a  
Group R-3 occupancy. Where the enclosed parking garage has no uses above, the required point  
at which an automatic sprinkler system is required is consistent with the threshold established for  
other moderate-hazard occupancies. The installation of an automatic fire sprinkler system for  
enclosed parking garages is required where the fire area containing the garage exceeds 12,000  
square feet \(1,115 m²\) in area. The fire behavior in an enclosed parking garage, although similar  
to that in an open parking garage, is of greater concern since smoke ventilation will be more  
difficult due to the lack of sufficient exterior openings. This concern is addressed by the required  
installation of an automatic sprinkler system once an enclosed parking garage exceeds the  
12,000-square-foot \(1,115-m²\) fire area threshold or an open parking garage fire area exceeds  
48,000 square feet \(4,460 m2\). Mechanical-access enclosed garages must be protected due to the  
limited access into and through the building.  
903.2.10.1 Commercial parking garages. Where commercial motor vehicles are stored within a  
building, the code mandates stringent floor areas when it comes to the requirement for an  
automatic sprinkler system. Where a fire area containing commercial parking exceeds 5,000  
square feet \(464 m²\) in area, the building housing the vehicles must be sprinklered throughout.  
While the term commercial motor vehicle is not defined in the IBC, and could vary, the IFC does  
provide a definition that may be appropriate to apply. The provision is intended to address those  
facilities housing larger vehicles. It is not applicable where pick-up trucks and similar-sized  
vehicles are being used for business activities.  
903.2.11.1 Stories without openings. The provisions of this section make specific the intent of  
the code to require automatic sprinkler protection in “windowless buildings.  
” A structure having  
inadequate openings on the exterior wall as determined by this section such that fire department  
access is insufficient is considered a “windowless buildings.  
” The requirements of this section  
apply to all occupancies except Group U. The provisions are applicable on a floor-by-floor basis  
and do not apply to any story above grade plane or basement having a floor area of 1,500 square  
feet \(139.4 m²\) or less\:  
• On the basis of each individual story above ground. Each individual story is analyzed  
for the size and the number of exterior wall openings. Thus, in a multistory building, it is  
possible to have a requirement that a sprinkler system be installed in one story and not in  
another.  
The code requires that the openings be\:  
1\. Installed entirely above the adjoining ground level. This provision is necessary so that  
effective fire-fighting and rescue can be accomplished from the exterior of the building.  
Where the openings cannot be located entirely above the adjoining ground level, the  
code permits the use of exterior stairways or ramps that lead directly to grade.  
2\. Of adequate size and spacing. Although it may be argued that the openings required by  
the code are not the equivalent of automatic fire-sprinkler protection, the access for fire-  
fighting provided by the openings has proven satisfactory.  
Although not expressly stated in the code, there is an expectation that a below-grade  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationopening used to satisfy this provision be simply a typical 3-foot by 6-foot, 8-inch \(914-  
mm by 2,032-mm\) door leading directly to the exterior stairway or ramp. However,  
above-grade openings are more specifically addressed. A total of 20 square feet \(1.86 m²\)  
of openings is mandated in each 50 lineal feet \(15,240 mm\) of exterior wall. It is not  
necessary to obtain all 20 square feet \(1.86 m²\) from a single opening, as long as the  
minimum dimension requirement of 30 inches \(762 mm\) is met. Multiple openings, each  
30 inches by 30 inches \(762 mm by 762 mm\) would comply; however, they may not be as  
effective as a larger single opening.  
Figure 903-8 Complying exterior openings.  
Figure 903-9 Noncomplying exterior openings.  
The intent of the code is that one or more openings totaling at least 20 square feet  
\(1.86 m2\) be provided in each 50 linear feet \(15,240 mm\) of exterior wall. It may be better  
stated that any wall section of 50 feet in length be provided with complying openings.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation3\. 4. 5. Thus, an exterior wall 100 feet \(30,480 mm\) long with 20-square-foot \(1.86-m²\) openings  
located at third points along the wall would comply, as shown in Figure 903-8. There is  
no portion of the wall that is 50 feet \(15,240 mm\) in length that does not contain the  
necessary openings. However, the same wall with such openings located at each end, as  
depicted in Figure 903-9, will not comply with the intent of the code insofar as there is a  
length of wall that exceeds the 50-foot \(15,240-mm\) dimension without an opening.  
Certainly, the same wall with only one 40-square-foot \(3.72-m²\) opening at one end also  
would not comply.  
Accessible to the fire department from the exterior. Surely, the openings would be of  
no value for fire-fighting if the fire-fighting forces could not gain access. The mere fact  
that the openings may be 30 or 40 feet \(9,144 or 12,192 mm\) above grade does not mean  
the openings are inaccessible. However, if, with the resources available to the fire  
department, access cannot be obtained to the openings, they would be considered  
inaccessible. The determination of accessibility rests with the building official. However,  
personnel in a fire department should be consulted for their professional opinions and also  
for their knowledge of the capabilities of their equipment.  
Adequate to allow access for fire-fighting to all portions of the interior of the  
building. The code requires that where openings are provided on only one side and the  
opposite exterior wall is more than 75 feet \(22,860 mm\) away, sprinklers shall be  
provided, or, as an alternative, openings shall be provided on at least two sides. The 75-  
foot \(22,860-mm\) distance is a straight-line measurement taken between the two opposing  
walls. Where complying openings are required in two exterior walls because of the 75-  
foot \(22,860-mm\) limitation, the openings are permitted on either two adjacent sides or  
opposite sides on the assumption that, with two exterior sides having openings, adequate  
access may be gained to effectively fight the fire. See Figure 903-10A.  
In stories above grade plane, the provisions require openings in exterior walls on a  
maximum of two sides. The code does not dictate specific openings for interior partition  
arrangements, because the normal openings provided through interior partitions provide  
adequate access to all interior portions of the building.  
Basements. As previously noted, the provisions of Section 903.2.11.1 apply to every  
story, including basements, of all buildings where the floor area exceeds 1,500 square feet  
\(139.4 m²\). Basements are considered to be somewhat more difficult than stories above  
grade when it comes to fighting fires from the exterior of the building. Therefore, several  
additional requirements are imposed in addition to those of Section 903.2.11.1.2. The  
code provides that when any portion of a basement is located more than 75 feet \(22,860  
mm\) from complying exterior wall openings, the basement is required to be provided with  
an automatic sprinkler system. The 75-foot \(22,860-mm\) measurement should be taken in  
a straight line, resulting in the use of the arc method, as shown in Figure 903-10B. The  
two methods of providing complying exterior openings set forth in Section 903.2.11.1 are  
both available for a basement condition. If the openings are available entirely above the  
adjoining ground level, they are regulated in the same manner as for floor levels above  
grade. Otherwise, the openings must lead directly to a complying exterior stairway or  
ramp. The 75-foot \(22,860-mm\) criterion is only applicable where the basement is a wide-  
open space with no interior walls or partitions that could obstruct a fire-hose water stream.  
Where the basement contains such walls or partitions, a sprinkler system is always  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrequired in the basement if it exceeds 1,500 square feet \(139.4 m²\) in floor area.  
Figure 903-10A Access to exterior openings.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 903-10B Openings in basements.  
With regard to the allowance that the exterior wall openings may be located below grade,  
areaways and light wells are considered to meet this requirement. However, the window wells  
and areaways should typically be provided with a stairway or ramp for gaining ready access to  
the openings. Furthermore, the plan dimensions of the areaway or window well should be  
adequate to permit the necessary maneuvering to accomplish fire-fighting or rescue from the  
opening. It may be necessary to consult with the fire department to obtain their expertise in these  
situations.  
903.2.11.2 Rubbish and linen chutes. Linen chutes and rubbish chutes are potential problem  
areas when it comes to fire safety for a variety of reasons. They are often used for the transfer of  
combustible materials, including some levels of hazardous materials. They are also concealed  
within the building construction, possibly allowing a fire to smolder and grow prior to being  
detected. Of even more concern, linen and rubbish chutes create vertical openings through a  
building, allowing for the rapid spread of fire, hot gases, and smoke up through the chute.  
Therefore, the IBC requires the installation of an automatic sprinkler system at the top of such  
chutes and in the rooms in which they terminate. Additional sprinklers are required as illustrated  
in Figure 903-11.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 903-11 Rubbish and linen chute construction and protection.  
903.2.11.3 Buildings 55 feet or more in height. Fire-fighting in buildings that are over 55 feet  
\(16,764 mm\) in height is difficult, and many jurisdictions do not have the personnel or  
equipment to rescue occupants and control fires on upper floors. Therefore, this section requires  
an automatic fire sprinkler system in those buildings in recognition of this problem. The  
provision applies to all buildings other than Group F-2 occupancies.  
903.3.1.1 NFPA 13 sprinkler systems. Where the code requires the installation of an automatic  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsprinkler system in a building, it typically is referring to a system designed and installed in  
accordance with the criteria of NFPA 13. This standard is also applicable for those provisions  
that permit the installation of a sprinkler system as an alternative to other code requirements.  
Throughout the code, the use of a sprinkler system “in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1” is  
referenced. In addition, where an automatic sprinkler system is required by the code with no  
direct reference to Section 903.3.1.1, the use of an NFPA 13 system is required. The fire  
sprinkler system in any building can be designed using NFPA 13. However, there are times when  
the code allows the use of sprinkler systems designed in accordance with NFPA 13R or 13D.  
The code will make a specific reference to Section 903.3.1.1 when the sprinkler is to be designed  
to NFPA 13.  
903.3.1.1.1 Exempt locations. It is the intent of sprinkler protection that sprinklers be installed  
throughout the structure, including basements, attics, and all other locations specified in the  
appropriate standard. However, as discussed previously, there are occasions where the sprinkler  
system is only required on a story or in a fire area. See the commentary on Sections 903.2  
through 903.2.10.1. It is also the intent of the IBC that when an automatic sprinkler system is  
required throughout, the same meaning is implied. One of the reasons for requiring protection  
throughout is the possibility of a fire in an unprotected area gaining such a foothold that the  
automatic sprinkler system would be overpowered. However, over the years, certain areas,  
locations, or conditions have shown that they require special consideration, and a substitute for  
sprinklers is permitted. In this section, the code provides six situations where sprinklers are not  
required provided that an automatic fire detection system is provided.  
1\. Rooms where the application of sprinkler water creates a life hazard. This could be a  
room where water reactive chemicals are used in an open system.  
2\. Rooms where sprinklers are considered undesirable, and where approved by the fire code  
official. This may be a storage vault for artwork or furs where another type of fire-  
extinguishing system is installed.  
3\. Generator or transformer rooms. In addition to the fire detection system, this room must  
also be separated by 2-hour fire-resistance-rated construction.  
4\. Rooms where the construction is noncombustible and the contents are noncombustible.  
Essentially, this is a room with absolutely no fire load.  
5\. Machinery rooms, machinery spaces, control rooms, and control spaces for fire service  
access elevators. Removing the sprinklers in these rooms eliminates the need for the shunt  
trip on the elevator, which is desirable since these elevators are designed to be used during  
the fire.  
6\. Machinery rooms, machinery spaces, control rooms, and control spaces for occupant  
evacuation elevators. Removing the sprinklers in these rooms eliminates the need for the  
shunt trip on the elevator, which is desirable since these elevators are designed to be used  
during the fire.  
Bathrooms in Group R occupancies do not require sprinklers provided that the bathroom does  
not exceed 55 square feet \(5 m²\) and it is located within a dwelling unit or sleeping unit.  
Therefore, this exception would not apply to a common use bathroom in the lobby of a hotel.  
One additional criteria is that the bathroom walls and ceilings must provide a 15-minute thermal  
barrier. Table 722.2.1.4\(2\) contains fire-resistance time ratings for various construction  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcomponents and indicates that ½-inch \(13-mm\) gypsum wallboard provides a 15-minute rating.  
It should be noted that as long as fire sprinklers are installed in all other locations required by  
the NFPA 13 design standard, the building is still considered to be sprinklered throughout. To  
make this determination, consider whether sprinklers are installed in all locations required by the  
code and the standard. If the sprinkler installation meets the criteria, but sprinklers are not  
provided in the elevator machine room, the building is still sprinklered throughout since the code  
stipulates that sprinklers are not required in such rooms in accordance with Item 5 or 6 of Section  
903.3.1.1.1.  
903.3.1.2 NFPA 13R sprinkler systems. Although residential sprinkler systems installed in  
accordance with NFPA 13R may be used to satisfy the requirements of specific institutional and  
residential occupancies, they are not always recognized as full sprinkler protection for the  
purposes of exceptions or reductions permitted by other code requirements. However, where  
specifically mentioned through a reference to this section, such systems may be considered  
acceptable. Where the code indicates that a benefit can be derived from a sprinkler system  
installed “in accordance with Section 903.3.1.2,  
” it intends that an NFPA 13R system can be  
used for the benefit. An important point is that an NFPA 13R sprinkler system is only permitted  
in residential-type buildings up to four stories in height with the highest or lowest story required  
to be no more than 30 feet \(9114 mm\) above or below the lowest level of fire department vehicle  
access. Of particular note is the requirement that the 4-story limit be measured from grade plane  
for “podium” buildings as established in Sections 510.2 and 510.4.  
The code imposes additional sprinkler requirements in the subsections of Section 903.3.1.2.  
These require the NFPA 13R sprinkler system to protect areas of a building where the standard  
would not require them \(see Section 102.4\). These extra protection requirements address certain  
balconies and decks, corridors and balconies used for egress, and attic areas.  
903.3.1.2.1 Balconies and decks. Experience has shown that numerous fires in apartment  
buildings have started from grilling or similar activities on the balconies and patios. Because the  
NFPA 13R sprinkler standard does not mandate sprinklers in such locations, the code requires  
such sprinkler protection. The provision is applicable to both dwelling units and sleeping units in  
buildings of Type VA or VB construction, or where the balconies are constructed in accordance  
with Section 705.2.3.1. Exception 3 in Section 705.2.3.1 allows for balconies to be constructed  
of Type V construction without a fire-resistance rating on buildings of Type III, IV, or V  
construction provided sprinkler protected is extended to protect the balcony areas. The automatic  
sprinkler protection is only required where there is a roof, deck, or balcony directly above a  
balcony, deck, or patio below. These areas will typically be protected by sidewall fire sprinklers.  
If there is no horizontal element located directly above an exterior balcony, deck, or ground-floor  
patio, the additional sprinkler protection is not required. See Figure 903-12.  
903.3.1.2.3 Attic protection. The NFPA 13R sprinkler standard does not require sprinklers in  
the attic space unless a fuel-fired appliance is located within the attic space, and then only one  
sprinkler is required, to be located above the equipment. In addition to this condition, the IBC  
mandates that if the attic is used for, or intended to be used for, living purposes or storage,  
sprinkler protection is required throughout the attic.  
If the building is of Type III, IV, or V construction, and the roof assembly is more than 55  
feet \(16,764 mm\) above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access, attics that are not  
required to be sprinklered to protect storage or a living space must still be protected by one of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfour methods\:  
• Install fire sprinkler protection throughout the attic.  
• Construct the attic of noncombustible materials.  
• Construct the attic of fire-retardant-treated wood.  
• Fill the entire attic space with noncombustible insulation.  
In applying this requirement for attic protection, the code specifies how the height of the roof  
assembly is to be measured. The measurement is from the lowest required fire department  
vehicle access road to the eave of the highest pitched roof, or to the intersection of the highest  
roof and the exterior wall, or to the top of the highest parapet, whichever is the greatest distance.  
Consider the top point of measurement to be where the fire department would rest the top of  
ladder. See Figures 903-13 and 903-14.

Attics in Group R-4, Condition 2 occupancies must all be protected regardless of the height of  
the roof assembly. Attics are to be protected with either sprinklers throughout, or one of four  
alternate methods\:  
• Install a heat detection system throughout the attic. The detection system must activate the  
fire alarm in the facility.  
• Construct the attic of noncombustible materials.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation• Construct the attic of fire-retardant-treated wood.  
• Fill the entire attic space with noncombustible insulation.  
903.3.1.3 NFPA 13D sprinkler systems. The NFPA 13D standard is designed for use in 1- and  
2-family dwellings and manufactured homes. The code permits such systems designed to this  
standard to be installed in 1- and 2-family dwellings, Group R-3 occupancies, and Group R-4,  
Condition 1 occupancies. Note that an NFPA 13D system is not allowed to be installed in a  
Group R-4, Condition 2 facility. Those facilities require a sprinkler system designed to NFPA 13  
or 13R.  
903.3.2 Quick-response and residential sprinklers. Based on the timely performance of quick-  
response and residential automatic sprinklers, the code requires that they be installed in those  
occupancies where response or evacuation may not be immediate because of the condition of the  
occupants. Therefore, all spaces within a Group I-2 smoke compartment containing care  
recipient sleeping units and all dwelling units and sleeping units in Group R and I-1 occupancies  
are to be provided with these types of sprinklers. Similarly, ambulatory care facilities must be  
provided with quick-response or residential sprinklers in all smoke compartments that contain  
one or more treatment rooms. Any Group I-2 smoke compartment containing either a gas  
fireplace appliance or decorative gas appliance must also be protected with the quicker reacting  
sprinklers. Such sprinklers are also required in light-hazard occupancies, where the quantity or  
combustibility of contents is low. Light-hazard occupancies included places of worship,  
education facilities, office buildings, museums, and seating areas of restaurants and theaters.  
903.3.8 Limited area sprinkler systems. There are situations where only a specific room or  
area needs to be protected with fire sprinklers. See the discussion of Section 903. For example,  
there is an option in the code to only sprinkler certain incidental uses listed in Table 509.1. In  
these situations, a limited area sprinkler system could be used. These systems are limited to a  
maximum of six sprinklers within any one fire area, but a building with multiple fire areas could  
utilize this option in each fire area. The water supply for these fire sprinklers is the domestic  
water piping in the building, there is no separate sprinkler piping or control valve. NFPA 13  
would be consulted to select the appropriate sprinkler, determine the minimum pressures and  
flows of the sprinklers, and design of the piping based on hydraulic calculations. Because of the  
limited capability of these systems, they are limited to only Light Hazard or Ordinary Hazard  
Group 1 occupancies as defined in NFPA 13.  
Section 904 Alternative Automatic Fire-Extinguishing  
# Systems  
The code permits the use of automatic fire-extinguishing systems other than automatic sprinkler  
systems for those circumstances approved by the fire code official. However, the use of an  
alternative system in lieu of a sprinkler system does not gain the benefit of exceptions or  
reductions in code requirements. Only those buildings or areas protected by automatic sprinkler  
systems can take advantage of the allowances provided throughout the code.  
The installation of automatic fire-extinguishing systems shall comply with this section, which  
for the most part refers to the appropriate design and test standard and listing for each of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationvarious types of systems. Those types addressed include wet-chemical, dry-chemical, foam,  
carbon dioxide, halon, clean-agent systems, water mist, and aerosol fire-extinguishing systems.  
The inspection and testing of the system is emphasized because of the importance of a fully  
operating system. Specific items are identified for inspection, including the location,  
identification, and testing of the audible and visible alarm devices.  
904.13 Commercial cooking systems. Fire-extinguishing systems are typically required for  
commercial cooking operations. The requirement for installing a fire-extinguishing system  
originates in the International Mechanical Code® and International Fire Code, but this section  
deals with installation criteria. Several requirements span the various codes, such as the  
requirement for the fire-extinguishing system to shut down the electrical power and fuel gases to  
the cooking equipment under the exhaust hood when it operates.  
904.14 Domestic cooking facilities. Domestic cooking equipment, such as cooktops and ranges,  
is permitted to be installed in Group I-1 occupancies, Group I-2 occupancies, and Group R-2  
college dormitories. The allowance of these domestic cooking appliances is justified by the  
requirement to protect the cooking appliances with an automatic fire-extinguishing system, or  
install cooking appliances listed to prevent ignition of cooking oil when their burners are set on  
high and unattended for 30 minutes. Essentially, these cooking appliances do not create as much  
heat allowing for a safer operation.  
Section 905 Standpipe Systems  
A standpipe system is a system of piping, valves, and outlets that is installed exclusively for fire-  
fighting activities within a building. Standpipes are not considered a viable substitute for an  
automatic fire sprinkler system. They are needed in buildings of moderate height and greater, and  
when used by trained personnel provide an effective means of fighting a fire.  
905.3 Required installations. This section provides the scoping criteria for when a standpipe  
system must be provided. Table 905-1 provides the basic requirements for when a standpipe  
system is required in a building. Building height is the primary consideration for the installation  
of a standpipe system. The general requirement calls for Class III standpipe systems where the  
vertical distance between the highest floor level in the building and the lowest level of fire  
department vehicle access exceeds 30 feet \(9,144 mm\). A similar condition occurs where a floor  
level is significantly below grade. See Figure 905-1. For measurement purposes, it is not  
necessary to consider any level of fire department vehicle access that, because of topographic  
features, makes access to the building from that point impractical or impossible. Where the  
building has four or more stories above or below grade, a standpipe system is required regardless  
of the building’s height in feet. Several exceptions allow the use of Class I rather than Class III  
standpipes. Additional standpipe requirements may apply to assembly occupancies, covered and  
open mall buildings, stages, and landscaped roofs.  
905.4 Location of Class I standpipe hose connections. The code intends that Class I standpipes  
are for the use of the fire department to fight fires within a building. Thus, the code requires that  
standpipe outlets be in every required interior exit stairway. The connections are to be located at  
the main floor landing of those stairways required by the code. As an alternative, the hose  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconnections are permitted to be located at the intermediate landing between floor levels, but only  
where specifically allowed by the fire code official. The installation of hose connections at  
intermediate landings is often preferred in order to avoid congestion at the stairway door. With  
these locations for standpipe outlets, the fire department personnel can bring a hose into the stair  
enclosure and make a hookup to outlets in a relatively protected area. Standpipe connections are  
not required for exit access stairways permitted to be unenclosed by Section 1019.3, as such  
stairways provide no protection for fire department personnel. A single hose connection can be  
installed where open breezeways or open corridors are provided between open stairways, and the  
open stairways are no more than 75 feet \(22,860 mm\) apart. These stairways are close together  
when you consider the fact that the fire department would typically be using a 100-foot \(30,480-  
mm\) hose line. Additionally, since the code allows for the open corridors and open stairways,  
there is no fire-resistance-rated separation between the two stairs so the single connection is  
allowed to serve both stairs. See Figure 905-2.  
Table 905-1. Required Standpipe Systems  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 905-1 Class III standpipe systems.  
Because a horizontal exit provides a barrier having a minimum fire-resistance rating of 2  
hours, it is a logical location for Class I standpipe outlets. Such outlets are to be provided on both  
sides of the horizontal exit wall adjacent to the egress doorways through the horizontal exit wall,  
regardless of whether or not egress is provided from both directions. An exception permits the  
omission of the standpipe hose connection at the horizontal exit opening where there is a limited  
distance between the opening and the stairway hose connection. The elimination of the hose  
connection is permitted on one side of the horizontal exit, as depicted in Figure 905-3, or on both  
sides, provided the “100-foot of hose plus 30-foot of hose stream” distance is not exceeded. The  
application of the exception is most common where the horizontal exit is provided to allow for  
the termination of a fire-resistance-rated corridor at an intervening room, or where necessary to  
address an inadequate number of exits or insufficient egress width. In those cases where the  
horizontal exit is provided because of a problem with travel distance, the omission of the  
standpipe connections will seldom be permitted. It should be noted that a standpipe system is not  
required simply because a horizontal exit occurs within the building. This provision addressing  
required hose connection locations is only applicable where a horizontal exit is provided in a  
building described in Section 905.3 as requiring a Class I or Class III standpipe system.  
Under certain circumstances, standpipe outlets located in interior exit stairways or at  
horizontal exit doorways may not provide adequate coverage for all portions of the story. This  
occurs when the most remote portion of the story is more than 150 feet \(45,720 mm\) from the  
standpipe connection. This distance is increased to 200 feet \(60,960 mm\) when the entire floor is  
sprinklered. Under these circumstances, additional standpipe outlets must be provided in  
approved locations when required by the fire code official. Exit passageways provide both  
protection and good access points for fire fighter access. A Class I standpipe connection is  
required at the entrance to the exit passageway from other portions of the building. In other  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwords, as fire fighters use the exit passageway to access the interior of the building, this is the  
point where the fire fighters would leave the exit passageway to fight the fire.  
Figure 905-2 Class I standpipe connections at open stairways.  
The enclosure for an interior exit stairway also provides protection for the standpipe and  
piping system. In those cases where the risers and laterals are not within interior exit stairways,  
the code requires that they be protected by equivalent fire-resistant construction. The exception  
to this requirement assumes that the automatic fire sprinkler system will keep the laterals cool  
enough so that they will not be damaged by fire. Figure 905-4 depicts the required locations of  
Class I standpipe connections.  
Standpipe connections are required for stages exceeding 1,000 square feet \(93 m²\); these  
connections must have both a 1½-inch \(38-mm\) outlet with hose and nozzle, and a 2½-inch \(64-  
mm\) outlet. The hose lengths provided must be able to reach all portions of the stage. These  
standpipe connections are to be located on each side of the stage, per Figure 905-5.  
On those roofs that have a flat enough slope for fire fighters to move about, the code requires  
at least one roof outlet so that exposure fires can be fought from the roof. The roof slope must be  
less than 4\:12 for this requirement to apply. This connection is to be located at the roof access  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfrom the interior exit stairway at the roof level. Frequently, in multi-story buildings, more than  
one interior exit stairway is provided. However, only one stairway is required to provide access  
to the roof. This section only requires one connection at the roof level and it should be at the  
stairway providing roof access.  
Figure 905-3 Connections at a horizontal exit.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 905-4 Class I standpipe connection locations.  
Figure 905-5 Class III standpipe locations at stages \> 1000 sq. ft.  
The interconnection of the standpipe risers at the bottom for multiple standpipe systems is  
intended to increase reliability and use during firefighting operations.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation905.5 Location of Class II standpipe hose connections. Class II standpipes are designed for  
occupant use, similar to portable fire extinguishers. It is the intent of the code to require the  
location of hose cabinets for Class II standpipes at intervals ensuring that all portions of a  
building will be within 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) of a nozzle attached to 100 feet \(30,480 mm\) of hose.  
In plan review, this would necessitate allowing for pulling the hose down corridors and through  
rooms such that several right-angle turns may be necessary before the hose stream can be placed  
on the fire. Therefore, judgment is necessary in the determination of standpipe locations. One  
method to account for this type of partitioning in a building where the future location of  
partitions is unknown is to subtract 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) from the straight-line distance between  
the hose cabinet and the remote location and then multiply the remainder by 1.4. If the result is  
more than 100 feet \(30,480 mm\), an additional standpipe connection will be required. Figure  
905-6 illustrates the location of a Class II standpipe in a building where an office floor has a  
central corridor with offices on each side. In this particular arrangement, it is obvious from the  
layout that the one standpipe will suffice.  
As there are no scoping provisions in Section 905.3 for a Class II or III standpipe system in a  
sprinklered Group A occupancy, other than the stage requirements of Section 905.3.4, the  
provisions of Section 905.5.1 have no application. Therefore, the required locations for Class II  
standpipe hose connections are limited to those buildings or areas required to have Class III  
standpipe systems.  
Because Class II standpipe systems are designed for occupant use, the code does not require  
fire-resistive protection. Class II standpipes are designed for first aid type of application, early in  
the fire event. Therefore, the piping is not expected to survive the fire for any duration.  
Figure 905-6 Class II standpipe connections.  
905.6 Location of Class III standpipe hose connections. Because Class III standpipes are a  
combination of the benefits of Class I and II systems, containing both 1½-inch \(38-mm\) outlets  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfor occupant use and 2½-inch \(64-mm\) outlets for fire department use, it is only logical that they  
be located so as to serve the building as required for both Class I and II standpipes. Figure 905-7  
shows the typical arrangement for a Class III standpipe in a building. Usually, the hose rack for  
1½-inch \(38-mm\) outlets and 2½-inch \(64-mm\) hose outlets are both located within the stair  
enclosure. Where the coverage requirements for Class II standpipes are such that interior exit  
stairway locations will not cover the entire building, laterals are usually run to other locations in  
order to provide for the required coverage.  
Class III standpipe systems and their risers and laterals are required to have fire-resistive  
protection the same as for Class I standpipes. In a sprinklered building, the laterals not located  
within the stair enclosure do not need to be protected as the sprinkler water will provide  
protection during the fire.  
Section 907 Fire Alarm and Detection Systems  
One of the most effective means of occupant protection in case of a fire incident is the  
availability of a fire alarm system. An alarm system provides early notification to occupants of  
the building in the event of a fire, thereby providing a greater opportunity for everyone in the  
building to evacuate or relocate to a safe area. This section covers all aspects of fire alarm  
systems and their components.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 905-7 Class III standpipe connections.  
Unlike most of the provisions of Section 903.2 addressing the required installation of an  
automatic sprinkler system, those requirements mandating a fire alarm system are typically not  
applied based on the fire area concept. Manual fire alarm systems are most often required based  
on the occupant load of the occupancy group under consideration, including any occupants of the  
same occupancy classification that may be identified in another fire area. Fire areas are not to be  
used in the application of this section regarding fire alarm systems except where specifically  
addressed in Sections 907.2.1 \(multiple Group A occupancies\) and 907.2.2 \(ambulatory care  
facilities\).  
One other item of note, when fire sprinkler systems are required, they are to be installed in the  
fire area, the occupancy, the entire story, or the entire building. However, with fire alarm  
systems, the typical requirement is to limit the fire alarm system to within the occupancy.  
907.2 Where required—new buildings and structures. Approved fire alarm systems, either  
manual, automatic, or both manual and automatic, are mandated in those occupancies and areas  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationidentified by this section. Where automatic fire detectors are mandated, smoke detectors are to be  
provided unless normal business operations would cause an inaccurate activation of the detector.  
All automatic fire detection systems are to be installed in accordance with NFPA 72.  
The requirements for fire alarm systems will indicate whether a manual fire alarm system or  
an automatic fire detection system is required. This section requires that at least one manual fire  
alarm box must be installed even if the code only requires an automatic fire detection or  
waterflow detection.  
Several of the manual fire alarm requirements contain a provision that allows for the  
elimination of manual fire alarm boxes when a fire sprinkler system is installed. Section 907.2  
states that when eliminating the manual fire alarm boxes, at least one manual fire alarm box must  
be installed. Exception 2 allows for the elimination of all manual fire alarm boxes in Group R-2  
occupancies unless the fire code official requires that a single box be installed.  
907.2.1 Group A. Where an assembly occupancy has a sizable occupant load, the safe egress of  
the occupants becomes an even more important consideration. When the occupant load reaches  
300, or when the occupant above or below the level of exit discharge is 100 or more, the code  
mandates a manual alarm system to provide early notification to the occupants. See Application  
Example 907-1. The IBC also requires portions of a Group E educational occupancy that are  
occupied for associated assembly purposes, such as a school lunchroom or library, to have  
alarms as required for the Group E use, rather than based on the less restrictive requirements  
mandated for Group A occupancies. In addition, the Group E fire alarm provisions are applicable  
to those areas within a Group E school building that may be classified as Group A occupancies,  
such as a gymnasium or auditorium. As is the case in many other occupancy classifications,  
manual alarm boxes are not required in those Group A occupancies where an automatic sprinkler  
system is installed that will immediately activate the occupant notification appliances \(audible  
and visible devices\) upon water flow.  
Where there are two or more Group A occupancies within the same building, the occupant  
loads of all such occupancies shall be used in evaluating whether or not a manual fire alarm  
system is required unless multiple fire areas are created in accordance with Section 707.3.10.  
Where the fire area concept is applied, the alarm requirement is based on the occupant load  
within each individual fire area. Only assembly uses within the fire area having an aggregate  
Group A occupant load of 300 or more, or a Group A occupant load of 100 or more above or  
below the level of exit discharge, are required to be provided with a manual fire alarm system.  
In assembly occupancies containing much larger occupant loads \(1,000 or more people\),  
activation of the required fire alarm system must initiate a prerecorded announcement via an  
emergency voice/alarm communications system. The emergency voice/alarm communications  
system, upon approval of the building official, may also be used for live voice emergency  
announcements originating from a constantly attended location. For more information on  
emergency voice/alarm communication systems, see the discussion of Section 907.5.2.2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 907-1  
907.2.2 Group B. Larger business occupancies classified as Group B require the installation of a  
fire alarm system. Where the total occupant load exceeds 499 persons, or where more than 100  
persons occupy Group B spaces above or below the lowest level of exit discharge, a manual fire  
alarm system shall be installed. See Figure 907-1. Similar to exceptions for other occupancies,  
the manual fire alarm boxes are not required in a sprinklered building where sprinkler water flow  
activates the notification devices, other than one box in an approved location.  
Figure 907-1 Example of required fire alarm system for Group B.  
Ambulatory care facilities must be provided with a manual fire alarm system as well as an  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationelectronically supervised automatic smoke detection system. The manual fire alarm system must  
be provided within the fire area in which the ambulatory care facility is located, while the smoke  
detection system must serve the care facility as well as the adjoining public areas. In both cases,  
the presence of an automatic sprinkler system modifies the requirements where occupant  
notification appliances will activate upon water flow.  
907.2.3 Group E. The IBC follows the philosophy of society in general that our children require  
special protection when they are not under parental control. Therefore, in addition to the other  
life-safety requirements for educational occupancies, manual fire alarm systems are required  
whenever the occupant load of any Group E occupancy is more than 50. In addition, when the  
building is provided with a smoke detection or sprinkler system, such systems shall be connected  
to the building’s fire alarm system. However, the more probable reason for such a low occupant  
load threshold being established is the exceptional value of such a system in an educational use.  
Students tend to react quickly and efficiently at the first notification of the alarm system, making  
safe egress possible. In addition, periodic fire drills reinforce the appropriate egress activity.  
Where the four conditions are met as listed in Exception 3, manual alarm boxes are not required.  
Item 3.4 of the exception requires a manual means to alert occupants and notify emergency  
services in the event a fire is discovered in an area such as a classroom or storage area that is  
allowed without the required detection from the other items. This requirement for at least one  
manual station is similar in intent to that of Section 907.2. Exception 4 also exempts manual fire  
alarm boxes where, in a sprinklered building, the sprinkler water flow activates the notification  
appliances and, consistent with Section 907.2, requires manual activation from a normally  
occupied location.  
The fire alarm system for a Group E occupancy must include an emergency voice/alarm  
communications system where the occupant load exceeds 100. This type of system will not only  
provide the necessary notification of occupants under possible fire conditions, but it is also  
valuable in ensuring the necessary level of life safety inside of the building during a lockdown  
situation. Because of concerns of school campus safety serving kindergarten through 12th grade  
facilities, it is beneficial to provide an effective means of communication between the established  
central location and each remote secured area.  
907.2.4 Group F. In multistory manufacturing occupancies, a fire alarm system is mandated  
where an aggregate occupant load of 500 or more is housed above and/or below the level of exit  
discharge. Similar to several other occupancies, the alarm system is necessary where there are  
very large occupant loads and where those occupants must travel vertically to exit. Application  
of the provision where occupants are located both above and below the lowest level of exit  
discharge is similar to that for Group B and M occupancies. In Group F occupancies, a manual  
fire alarm system is mandated where the aggregate occupant load of those levels, other than the  
exit discharge level, exceeds 499. Where the building is sprinklered, only a single manual alarm  
box is required if the water flow of the sprinkler system activates the notification appliances.  
907.2.5 Group H. Only those Group H occupancies associated with semiconductor fabrication  
or the manufacture of organic coatings need to be provided with a manual alarm system. Note  
that there is no exception allowing elimination of manual fire alarm boxes. Because of the  
increased hazard in these occupancies all Group H are required to be sprinklered, and all of the  
manual alarm boxes must be installed. Areas containing highly toxic gases, organic peroxides,  
and oxidizers shall be protected by an automatic smoke detection system when required in the  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationInternational Fire Code.  
907.2.6 Group I. As many patients, residents, or inmates of Group I occupancies are incapable  
of self-preservation, Section 907.2.6 provides for early warning of the occupants and staff, thus  
enhancing life safety. The general provisions require a manual fire alarm system to be installed  
in all Group I occupancies, including those classified as Group I-4. However, an automatic  
smoke detection system is only required in those occupancies classified as Group I-1, I-2, or I-3.  
Where a Group I-1, Condition 1 facility is provided with an automatic sprinkler system designed  
to NFPA 13, only corridors and waiting areas open to such corridors need to be equipped with  
the smoke detection system. The corridor smoke detection system required in Group I-2 facilities  
may be omitted where the patient sleeping rooms have smoke detectors that are connected to the  
fire alarm system and provide a visual display on the corridor side of each patient room, as well  
as a visual and audible alarm at the appropriate nursing station. Another exception exempts the  
requirement for corridor smoke detection where sleeping room doors are equipped with  
automatic door closers having integral smoke detectors on the room side that performs the  
required alerting functions.  
Because of their special nature, in Group I-3 occupancies the provisions for fire alarm systems  
are greatly expanded. The manual and automatic fire alarm system is to be designed to alert the  
facility staff. Actuation of an automatic fire-extinguishing system, an automatic sprinkler system,  
a manual fire alarm box, or a fire detector must initiate an automatic fire alarm signal, which  
automatically notifies staff. For obvious reasons, manual fire alarm boxes need only be placed at  
staff-attended locations having direct supervision over the areas where boxes have been omitted.  
Under certain conditions, the installation of an approved smoke detection system in resident  
housing areas is required.  
907.2.7 Group M. The threshold at which a manual fire alarm system is required for a Group M  
occupancy is the same as that for a Group B occupancy. During that portion of time when the  
building is occupied, the signal from a manual fire alarm box or waterflow switch may be  
designed to only activate a signal at a constantly attended location, rather than provide the  
customary visual and audible notification. However, to allow this to occur the fire alarm system  
must be an emergency voice/alarm communication system. When an alarm occurs, the  
emergency voice/alarm communications system can be used to notify the customers of the  
emergency conditions. This provision is helpful in eliminating nuisance alarms that may occur  
because of the presence of fire alarm boxes.  
907.2.8 Group R-1. When asleep, the occupants of residential buildings will usually be unaware  
of a fire, and it will have an opportunity to spread before being detected. As a result, a majority  
of fire deaths in residential buildings have occurred because of this delay in detection. It is for  
this reason that the IBC requires fire alarm systems in addition to smoke detection in certain  
residential structures.  
In hotels and other buildings designated as Group R-1, the general provisions mandate that  
both a manual fire alarm system and an automatic fire detection system be installed. There is an  
exception that eliminates the requirement for a manual alarm system for such occupancies less  
than three stories in height where all guestrooms are completely separated by minimum 1-hour  
fire partitions and each unit has an exit directly to a yard, egress court, or public way. This  
exception is based on the compartmentation provided by the separations between units, the  
requirement that the Group R-1 occupancy is sprinklered, and by the relatively rapid means of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationexiting available to the occupants. Where guestrooms are limited to egress directly to the  
exterior, early notification, although important, is not as critical. A second exception requires the  
alarm system, but does not mandate the installation of fire alarm boxes throughout buildings that  
are protected throughout by an approved supervised fire-sprinkler system. There is, however, a  
need for at least one manual fire alarm box installed in a location approved by the building  
official. In addition, sprinkler flow must activate the notification appliances. The automatic  
smoke detection system required by this section need only be provided within all corridors that  
serve guestrooms. An exception eliminates the requirement for the automatic smoke detection  
system in buildings where egress does not occur through interior corridors or other interior  
spaces.  
907.2.9 Group R-2. Group R-2 buildings such as apartment houses are to be provided with a fire  
alarm system based on the number of dwelling units and sleeping units, as well as the location of  
any such units in relationship to the level of exit discharge. Where more than 16 dwelling units  
or sleeping units are located in a single structure, or where such units are placed at a significant  
distance vertically from the egress point at ground level, it is beneficial that a detection and  
notification system be provided. If any one of the three listed conditions exists, a manual fire  
alarm system is required unless exempted or modified by one of the three exceptions. Exceptions  
similar to those permitted for Group R-1 occupancies apply to Group R-2 buildings as well.  
Provisions addressing the installation of an automatic smoke detection system in Group R-2  
college and university buildings are essentially the same as those required for Group R-1  
occupancies. The single difference is that the detection system must also be provided in laundry  
rooms, mechanical equipment rooms, and storage rooms, as well as all common areas located  
outside of the individual sleeping units or dwelling units. It is intended that these provisions be  
applicable only to those residential buildings that are operated by a university or college. It is not  
incumbent that the facility be located on the college or university campus. The requirement is  
applicable to all facilities operated by a college or university.  
907.2.10 Group S. A manual fire alarm system is required in the corridors and common areas of  
self-storage facilities three or more stories in height. As with many of the other occupancies, the  
pull stations for the manual alarms can be eliminated when the building is sprinklered and the  
alarm system is activated by the water flow. While users of these storage facilities may know  
how to get to their unit, they are typically not familiar with the entire building and the alarm  
system can notify them of problems within the building. The provisions also establish that the  
visible alarm notification is only required out in the corridor and common areas and not within  
the storage units themselves.  
907.2.11 Single- and multiple-station smoke alarms. As indicated in the introduction to the  
residential fire alarm provisions, residential fire deaths far exceed those of any other building  
classification. Thus, the IBC requires smoke alarms in all residential buildings and in certain  
institutional occupancies. In Group R-1 occupancies, single- or multiple-station smoke alarms  
are to be installed in all sleeping areas, in any room along the path between the sleeping area and  
the egress door from the sleeping unit, and on each story within the sleeping unit. In all other  
residential occupancies, the code requires that smoke detectors be located in the sleeping rooms  
and the corridor or area giving access to the sleeping rooms. In addition, at least one smoke  
alarm shall be installed on each story of a dwelling unit, including basements. Where split levels  
occur in guestrooms or dwelling units, a smoke alarm need only be installed on the upper level,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprovided there is no intervening door between the adjacent levels. See Figure 907-2 for  
illustrations of these provisions.  
In order to notify occupants throughout the dwelling unit or sleeping unit of a potential  
problem, multiple smoke alarms need to be interconnected. Therefore, when activation of one of  
the alarm devices takes place, activation of all the alarms must occur. This requirement is also  
applicable where listed wireless alarms are installed in lieu of physically interconnected smoke  
alarms. The intent of the code is that the alarms be audible throughout the dwelling, particularly  
in all sleeping rooms.  
Figure 907-2 Location of smoke alarms.  
As effective as smoke alarms are in detecting and alerting to a fire, they can be a source of  
nuisance alarms, such as activation when the toast is burnt or reaction to steam from a shower or  
cooking operation. Therefore, the code specifies minimum separation distances from these  
potential sources of nuisance alarms. Table 907-1 provides the minimum required separation  
distances based on the type of smoke alarm installed. The separation from the bathroom door is  
only required if the bathroom contains a bathtub or shower.  
Sections 907.2.12 through 907.4.1 contain additional requirements for the installation of fire  
alarm systems. The previous requirements discussed were based on the occupancy classification;  
these sections are based on the use or operation within the building without regard for the  
occupancy classification. Table 907-2 lists these special uses and provides the requirement for  
the installation of a fire alarm system.  
Table 907-1. Smoke Alarm Separation from Nuisance Alarm Sources  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation907.4.2 Manual fire alarm boxes. Manual fire alarm boxes are one of the four initiating options  
for fire alarm systems allowed by Section 907.4. The IBC often requires a manual fire alarm  
system because of the special occupants or hazards that exist within the building. Manual fire  
alarm boxes, defined as manually operated devices used to initiate an alarm signal and often  
referred to as pull stations, are used in many situations as a means for occupants to notify others  
of a potential fire emergency. This section identifies the proper locations for the installation of  
these alarm boxes.  
In order that manual fire alarm boxes are readily available and accessible to all occupants of  
the building, they are to be located in close proximity to the point of entry to each exit. This  
would include placement within 5 feet \(1,524 mm\) of exterior exit doors, as well as doors  
entering interior exit stairways and exit passageways, as well as those doors accessing exterior  
exit stairways and horizontal exits. By placing the boxes adjacent to the exit doors, they will be  
available to occupants using any of the available exit paths. Additional boxes may be required in  
extremely large nonsprinklered structures, as the maximum travel distance to the nearest alarm  
box cannot exceed 200 feet \(60,960 mm\). In sprinklered buildings, travel distance to a fire alarm  
box is not limited. A manual fire alarm box, required to be red, must be located in a position so  
that it can be easily identified and accessed. The maximum height of 48 inches \(1,372 mm\),  
measured from the floor to the activating lever or handle, is based on the high-end-reach range  
limited by the accessibility provisions of ICC A117.1. The minimum height of 42 inches \(1,067  
mm\) keeps the activating mechanism in a position readily viewed and providing ease of  
manipulation. See Figure 907-3.  
Unless the fire alarm system is monitored by an approved supervising station, a sign must be  
installed on or adjacent to each manual fire alarm box advising the occupants to notify the fire  
department. Where a supervised alarm system is in place, notification becomes automatic and the  
sign is not necessary.  
Table 907-2. Required Fire Alarm Systems for Special Uses  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 907-3 Manual fire alarm box installation.  
Often it is necessary to develop a means of reducing the accidental or intentional damage or  
activation of the alarm-initiating device. Therefore, the code gives the fire code official authority  
to accept protective covers placed over the listed boxes. The alarm box should remain easily  
identifiable when covered, with adequate instructions for operation. See Figure 907-4.  
907.5 Occupant notification systems. Once a fire alarm system has been activated by one of the  
four initiating options listed in Section 907.4, the occupants need to be alerted and notified of the  
hazard.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 907-4 Manual fire alarm box with protective cover.  
In most situations, it is intended that all occupants in the building are notified. There are times  
when this is not the best approach, such as in a hospital or detention facility where the occupants  
cannot respond on their own. In certain cases, the code allows the notification to be to staff so  
that appropriate actions can be taken.  
Notification to the occupants and staff occurs by either an audible signal or a visible signal, or  
both. Where the occupants are expected to respond the alarm, such as an office building, an  
audible alarm must be heard throughout the facility. Section 907.5.2.1 addresses audible alarms  
and requires that the audibility must be at least 15 decibels above the average ambient sound  
level. This must be accomplished without any single device exceeding 110 decibels. Sound  
pressure above 110 decibels can cause damage to the ear.  
The type of audible signal used in sleeping rooms of Group R-1 and R-2 occupancies must be  
a low-frequency \(520 Hz\) signal instead of the typical 3 kHz that is normally used for alarms.  
The low-frequency signal has been shown to improve the waking effectiveness for several  
higher-risk occupant types \(e.g., people over 65 who are hard of hearing, school-age children,  
and people who are alcohol impaired\).  
907.5.2.2 Emergency voice/alarm communication systems. As we have seen in certain  
occupancies or uses, an emergency voice/alarm communication \(EV/AC\) system is required.  
This system is a fire alarm system with a different type of notification process. When the fire  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationalarm system is activated, the EV/AC sounds a prerecorded message rather than the beep, beep,  
beep of traditional fire alarm systems. The system can be designed with a different prerecorded  
message for different activation scenarios. For example, when a smoke detector activates on the  
east side of the building, the message can direct occupants to the west exits. The EV/AC can also  
be zoned so that when a fire occurs on a floor in a high-rise building, the notification is delivered  
to the fire floor and the floor above and the floor below. The messages are to be approved and  
would be addressed in the fire safety and evacuation plan required by Section 1002.2.  
The speakers placed throughout the building must be grouped into paging zones to allow for  
different messages for specific locations within the building. At a minimum, a separate paging  
zone is required for each floor level, elevator groups, areas of refuge, and interior exit stairways.  
Another function of the EV/AC system is the ability to provide live announcements. The  
initial message may have been delivered, but now a different message is needed based on the  
spread of the fire. For example, using the EV/AC system the fire department can direct occupants  
to different stairways or advise them to stay in place.  
907.5.2.3 Visible alarms. Visible alarms are intended to alert hearing-impaired individuals to a  
fire emergency. Visible alarms are also required in areas where the ambient noise level exceeds  
95 decibels since the audible alarm sound pressure level must be 15 decibels above ambient, but  
not more than 110 decibels. As with those locations where audible alarm systems are required,  
the IBC identifies the specific conditions under which visible alarm notification appliances are  
also mandated. In those portions of the building deemed to be public areas or common areas,  
visual alarms shall be provided in addition to audible alarms. For example, in an office building,  
the lobby, public corridors, and public restrooms would be considered public areas, whereas the  
corridors, toilet rooms, break areas, and conference rooms inside an office suite would be  
considered common areas. On the other hand, the individual offices of each employee would be  
considered private use. Although such offices would not require the installation of visible alarm  
notification appliances, wiring must be in place for future installation of the alarms as necessary.  
The potential of additional visible alarm notification appliances is taken into account by  
requiring at least 20 percent spare capacity for the appliance circuits. Keep in mind that visible  
alarms are only required in those occupancies where an alarm system is first required by Section  
907.2\. Table 907.5.2.3.2 is used to determine the number of sleeping units in Group R-1 or I-1  
occupancies that must be provided with visible alarm notification appliances. In both  
occupancies, the appliances are to be activated by both the in-room smoke alarm and the  
building’s fire alarm system. The number of sleeping units required to have both visible and  
audible alarms is based on the total number of units in the building. Not strictly limited to  
sleeping units, the visible and audible alarm requirements are also applicable where dwelling  
units are located within a Group R-1 occupancy. In Group R-2 apartment houses and similar  
occupancies required by the code to have a fire alarm system, provisions must be made for the  
future installation of visible alarm notification devices in accordance with ICC A117.1 as they  
become necessary.  
Section 909 Smoke Control Systems  
The provisions of this section are applicable to the design, construction, testing, and operation of  
mechanical or passive smoke control systems only when they are required by other provisions of  
the IBC. Section 909 specifically exempts smoke- and heat-removal requirements that appear in  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSection 910 and are discussed in the next section of this handbook. Also, this section states that  
mechanical smoke control systems are not required to comply with Chapter 5 of the  
International Mechanical Code \(IMC®\) for exhaust systems unless their normal use would  
otherwise require compliance.  
The provisions of this section establish minimum requirements for the design, installation,  
and acceptance testing of smoke control systems, but nothing within the section itself is intended  
to imply that a smoke control system is to be installed. Some sections that specifically reference  
Section 909 are the requirements for atriums \(Section 404.5\), underground buildings \(Section  
405.5\), and windowless buildings housing Group I-3 occupancies \(Section 408.9\). Smoke  
control systems are intended to provide a protective environment in areas outside that of fire  
origination to allow for the evacuation or relocation of occupants in a safe manner. The  
provisions are not designed to protect the contents from damage or assist in fire-fighting  
activities. Much of this section was originally based on the American Society of Heating,  
Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers \(ASHRAE\) publication, Design of Smoke Control  
for Buildings; NFPA 92-A, Standard for “Smoke-Control Systems Utilizing Barriers and  
Pressure Differences”; and its companion NFPA 92-B,  
“Standard for Smoke Management  
Systems in Malls, Atria, and Large Spaces.  
” These three documents have been replaced and  
updated since then, and NFPA 92,  
“Standard for Smoke Control Systems” has replaced the  
previous NFPA 92-A and 92-B standards and is now referenced.  
Although this section covers both passive and active smoke control systems, the majority of  
the material presented addresses the three mechanical methods—pressurization \(Section 909.6\),  
airflow \(Section 909.7\), and exhaust \(Section 909.8\)—with other sections addressing related  
subjects such as the design fire; equipment, including fans, ducts, and dampers; power supply;  
detection and control systems; and the fire fighter’s smoke control panel.  
An important segment of Section 909 addresses acceptance testing of the smoke control  
system. Smoke control system installation requires special inspection testing per Section  
909.18.8 to be performed during erection of ductwork and prior to concealment. These  
inspections are intended for the purpose of testing for leaks, as well as for recording the specific  
device locations. The latter creates, in effect, as-built drawings for the system. Additional testing  
and verification prior to occupancy is also mandated. Section 909.18.8.3 requires the work of the  
special inspector to be documented in a final report. The report shall be reviewed by the  
responsible registered design professional who is required to certify the work. The final,  
designer-approved report, together with other information addressed in Section 909.18.9, shall be  
provided to the fire code official, and a copy shall be maintained on file at the building.  
909.20 Smokeproof enclosures. The provisions of this section identify the methods for  
complying with Section 1023.12 for the construction of smokeproof enclosures. Smokeproof  
enclosures are required by Sections 403 for high-rise buildings, 405 for underground buildings,  
and 412.2 for airport traffic control towers. There are two methods for construction of a  
ventilated smokeproof enclosure, both of which use an enclosed interior exit stairway or ramp.  
Either an exterior balcony or a ventilated vestibule can be used as the buffer between the floor of  
the building and the exit stairs or ramp. In addition, pressurization of the stair or ramp shaft is a  
permitted alternative. A fourth option is found in Section 909.20.6 which is essentially a  
combination of the pressurization and vestibule protection methods.  
Unless the pressurization provisions of Section 909.20.5 are used where a smokeproof  
enclosure is required, the exit path to the stair or ramp shall include a vestibule or an open  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationexterior balcony. The minimum size of the vestibule is established in Section 909.20.1 and  
illustrated in Figure 909-1. A minimum 2-hour fire-resistance-rated fire barrier separates the  
smokeproof enclosure from the remainder of the building and also separates the stairway or ramp  
from the vestibule. Per Section 1023.4, the only openings permitted into the enclosure are the  
required means of egress doors. Where ventilating equipment is used for either the vestibule,  
stair or ramp enclosure, it must comply with Section 909.20.7. Construction of an open exterior  
balcony is based on the required fire-resistance rating for the building’s floor construction, which  
would typically be 2 hours.  
Figure 909-1 Ventilated vestibule.  
909.20.3 Natural ventilation alternative. In this section, the code provides the details of  
construction where natural ventilation is used to comply with the concept of a smokeproof  
enclosure. Where an open exterior balcony is provided, fire doors into the stairway or ramp shall  
comply with Section 716.2. In a vestibule scenario, a minimum 90-minute fire door assembly is  
required between the floor and the vestibule. Between the vestibule and the stairway or ramp, the  
door assembly need only have a 20-minute fire-protection rating. The necessary vestibule  
ventilation is to be provided by an opening in the exterior wall at each vestibule. Facing an outer  
court, yard, or public way at least 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) in width, the exterior wall opening must  
provide at least 16 square feet \(1.5 m²\) of net open area. See Figure 909-2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 909-2 Natural ventilation of vestibule.  
909.20.4 Mechanical ventilation alternative. Smokeproof enclosures may also be ventilated by  
mechanical means. As with naturally ventilated vestibules, a minimum 1½-hour fire door as  
mandated by Table 716.2 is required between the building and the vestibule, whereas the door  
between the vestibule and the stairway need only have a 20-minute fire-protection rating. Where  
mechanical ventilation is used, the 1½-hour fire door assembly must also meet the criteria of  
Section 716.2.2.1 in order to minimize air leakage between the building and the vestibule.  
Individual tightly constructed ducts are used to supply and exhaust air from the vestibule. Air  
is supplied near the floor level of the vestibule and exhausted near the top. The locations of the  
supply and exhaust registers are illustrated in Figure 909-3, as is the location for the smoke trap.  
The smoke trap is created by requiring the ceiling of the vestibule to be at least 20 inches \(508  
mm\) higher than the door opening. It is important that doors in the open position do not obstruct  
the duct openings. The code also allows the use of a performance-based engineered vestibule  
ventilation system per Section 909.20.4.2.1. In addition to ventilation of the vestibule, air shall  
be provided and relieved from the stair or ramp shaft as well. By supplying an adequate amount  
of air while providing a dampered relief opening, a minimum positive pressure of 0.10 inch \(29  
Pa\) of water column shall be maintained in the shaft relative to the vestibule with all doors  
closed.  
909.20.5 Stairway and ramp pressurization alternative. Smokeproof stairway and ramp  
enclosures can also be protected using pressurization. Stairway pressurization can only be used  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationin buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system designed to NFPA 13.  
Through the pressurization of the stair or ramp shaft to a prescribed level, the need for vestibules  
or open exterior balconies is eliminated. Pressurization levels for the interior exit stairways and  
ramps shall fall between 0.10 inch \(25 Pa\) and 0.35 inch \(87 Pa\) of water column in relationship  
to the building. With this method of pressurization, a vestibule and ventilation of the vestibule is  
deemed to be unnecessary. See Figure 909-4.  
909.20.6 Pressurized stair and vestibule alternative. A fourth design option is to provide a  
combination vestibule/stairway pressurization system. This method allows for slightly lower  
pressure differentials than required under Section 909.20.5 due to the presence of the vestibule.  
Having the vestibule serves as a second line of defense to keep smoke from entering the  
stairway. Under this option, the smoke would need to overcome the vestibule pressurization, and  
then the increased enclosure pressure in order to enter the stairway system. See Figure 909-5.  
Figure 909-3 Mechanical ventilation of vestibule.  
909.21 Elevator hoistway pressurization alternative. Elevator shafts must often be protected  
to limit the spread of smoke from one story to another. Elevator hoistways can be pressurized,  
similar to stairway pressurization, in lieu of constructing an elevator lobby or meeting other  
protection criteria as established in Section 3006.3. A difference between hoistway pressurization  
and stairway pressurization is in the required pressure differentials. Elevator hoistways  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationpressurization levels fall between 0.10 and 0.25 inch \(25 and 67 Pa\) of water column in  
relationship to the building. The increased pressure restricts smoke from entering the hoistway.  
One concern is the use of the elevator during the time when hoistway pressurization is  
operating. As such, the acceptance test must demonstrate that all elevator doors will open and  
close when the hoistways are pressurized. The pressurization system is activated by either  
activation of the fire alarm system, or activation of a lobby smoke detector. When the lobby  
smoke detector activates, per the ASME A17.1 standard the elevator cars are captured, returned  
to a designated floor, and the elevator doors are open. Exception 4 acknowledges that the  
elevator doors are open in this mode and does not require the pressure differential on that floor  
level; however, all other floor levels must comply with the pressure requirements with the  
elevators open on the floor of recall.  
Figure 909-4 Stairway pressurization.  
Section 910 Smoke and Heat Removal  
Smoke and hot gases created by a fire rise to the underside of the ceiling or roof structure above  
and then build up. This causes reduced visibility to the point where fire-fighting is difficult and  
radiates the heat back to the combustible materials below which can lead to flashover. Also, as  
the hot gases accumulate near the roof structure, the unburned products of combustion become  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsuperheated, and if a supply of air is introduced, these hot, unburned products of combustion will  
ignite violently. Thus, it has been found that it is imperative that industrial and warehouse-type  
occupancies be provided with some type of smoke and heat removal system. This is  
accomplished with either smoke and heat vents in the roof or a mechanical smoke removal  
system. Although this section is typically applied to one-story buildings, as well as one-story  
portions of multistory buildings, smoke and heat removal may also be required in a multistory  
structure. Where the space requiring smoke and heat removal is not located at the upper story of  
the building, a mechanical smoke removal system must be provided rather than smoke and heat  
vents.  
Figure 909-5 Pressurized stair and vestibule alternative.  
910.2 Where required. The IBC requires smoke and heat removal in specified industrial  
buildings and warehouses and in any occupancy, as required by the IFC, where high-piled  
combustible storage is provided. The intent is that those occupancies presenting a potential to  
include large areas of combustible materials, and as a result, large volumes of smoke, be  
provided with the means to exhaust the hot gases and smoke during a fire. See Application  
Example 910-1.  
For those buildings containing high-piled combustible storage, the requirements for smoke  
and heat removal are addressed in IFC Chapter 32.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 910-1  
It is not uncommon for such large areas to be protected by a sprinkler system that is designed  
to operate without the benefit of smoke and heat removal. These types of sprinklers are Early  
Suppression Fast Response \(ESFR\) and Control Mode Specific Application \(CMSA\) systems.  
Such sprinklers have specific designs to control or extinguish a fire, through the quick  
application of large amounts of water. Where either an ESFR sprinkler system or a CMSA  
sprinkler system using sprinklers with a response time index \(RTI\) of 50 or less and designed to  
operate with no more than 12 sprinklers, are installed, smoke and heat removal is not required.  
In buildings where smoke and heat removal is required, it can be accomplished with either  
smoke and heat vents or a mechanical smoke removal system. The method chosen is up to the  
designer; however, there are some limitations. In nonsprinklered buildings, smoke and heat vents  
are the only acceptable method. In sprinklered buildings, either method will suffice provided that  
the protected area is only one story in height. When it is more than one story, smoke and heat  
vents are not an option and a mechanical smoke removal system must be used.  
910.3 Smoke and heat vents. As smoke and heat vents are intended to release smoke and hot  
gases from a fire within the building, the code requires that they operate automatically but with  
the capability to open manually. The smoke and heat released should not put any adjacent  
building or property into danger, so the smoke and heat vents must be placed a minimum of 20  
feet \(6096 mm\) from fire walls and from any lot line in order to reduce exposure to adjacent  
property. Smoke and heat vents shall also be located at least 10 feet \(3048 mm\) from fire  
barriers. Smoke and heat vents need to be distributed uniformly to provide smoke removal  
throughout the protected area. Such conditions as roof pitch, curtain location, sprinkler head  
location, and structural members shall be considered in the location of vents. The fusible link  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationtemperature to open the vents is set high enough to ensure that the sprinkler system will activate  
prior to the vents opening.  
Note that the formula to determine the required venting area is different for sprinklered  
buildings versus nonsprinklered buildings. For sprinklered buildings, the entire volume of the  
protected area is used and then divided by 9,000 to determine the minimum vent area. In  
nonsprinklered buildings, the floor area is used rather than the volume. In the nonsprinklered  
scenario, the floor area is divided by 50 to determine the minimum vent area.  
910.4 Mechanical smoke removal systems. A mechanical smoke removal system is only  
intended to remove the smoke for fire-fighting operations; it is not a life-safety system, and it is  
not a smoke control system as regulated in Section 909. The system is designed to operate during  
the fire and remove smoke to provide ventilation similar to the smoke and heat vents. The design  
criteria are to provide two air changes per hour for the entire volume of the protected area.  
Ventilation is accomplished with exhaust fans, each with a maximum capacity of 30,000 cubic  
feet per minute \(14.2 m3/s\). As with any exhaust system in a building, makeup air needs to be  
provided at a ratio of 8 square feet per 1,000 cubic feet per minute \(0.74 m2 per 0.4719 m3/s\) of  
exhaust. See Application Example 910-2.  
The smoke removal system can be used as part of the normal building ventilation, as long as  
the exhaust fans shut down automatically upon sprinkler water flow. The fire department can  
control the exhaust fans manually with the manual controls that override the automatic shut  
down and allow on/off control of the fans.  
The mechanical exhaust fans are expected to operate during the fire occurrence. To allow this  
operation, the smoke removal system must be wired ahead of the main disconnect and the wiring  
must be protected against an interior fire exposure of 1,000°F \(538°C\) for a period of not less  
than 15 minutes. This can be accomplished with fire-resistance-rated construction or cable listed  
for this purpose.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 910-2  
Section 911 Fire Command Center  
The fire command center is the control center for the fire- and life-safety systems in a complex  
building. The IBC mandates a fire command center be provided in only very special structures  
such as high-rise buildings, airport traffic control towers, buildings with smoke-protected  
assembly seating and large Group F-1 or S-1 buildings \(see Sections 403.4.6, 412.2.3.2, 909.16  
and 911.1, respectively\). The purpose of the command center is to provide a central location  
where fire personnel can operate during an emergency and coordinate fire-fighting operations  
and building systems. Located as determined by the fire department, the fire command center  
shall be isolated from the remainder of the building by a minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated  
fire barrier. In general, the size of the fire command center is dependent on the building size, but  
must be a minimum size of 200 square feet \(19 m²\) in area, but a 96 square foot \(9 m²\) size is  
permitted for the F-1 and S-1 buildings. The room must contain all of the system components,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcontrols, display panels, indicators, devices, furnishings, and plans that are listed in Section  
911.1.6.  
Except for the large Group F-1 and S-1 buildings, the provisions of Section 911 are only  
applicable where some other provision of the code specifically mandates that a fire command  
center be provided. As an example, Section 909.16 mandates that the fire fighter’s smoke-control  
panel required for buildings provided with a smoke-control system must be located in a fire  
command center if the smoke-control system is used to address smoke-protected assembly  
seating conditions. For other smoke-control applications, a fire command center is not required  
to be provided.  
Section 912 Fire Department Connections  
Buildings equipped with an automatic sprinkler system designed to NFPA 13 “Standard for the  
Installation of Sprinkler Systems” or NFPA 13R “Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler  
Systems in Low-Rise Residential Occupancies” will typically have a fire department connection  
\(FDC\). An FDC is not required for sprinkler systems designed to NFPA 13D “Standard for the  
Installation of Sprinkler Systems in One- and Two-Family Dwellings and Manufactured  
Homes”  
. Class I and III standpipes will also be equipped with an FDC, while Class II standpipe  
systems will not. The FDC is used to augment the water supply in a fire sprinkler system, or to  
provide water in a standpipe system. In a fire sprinkler system, this allows the fixed sprinkler  
piping to apply more water directly onto the fire, many times before the fire-fighting crews can  
reach the fire with hose lines. Since the FDC is critical to effectively fighting the fire, it must be  
available and usable. Section 912 contains criteria intended to keep the FDC in an accessible and  
usable condition. The hose threads must match the threads on the fire hose carried by the fire  
department. The FDC is to be located on the street side of the building or on a side facing a fire  
apparatus access road. The FDC must be immediately accessible and requires a minimum clear  
space of 36 inches \(762 mm\) on all sides and 78 inches \(1981 mm\) vertically. This clear space  
needs to take into account the building, fences, railings, and landscaping. The location should be  
chosen so that the hose lines from the closest fire hydrant to the FDC do not obstruct on-site fire  
apparatus access roads, although this is not always possible. See Figure 912-1.  
Section 913 Fire Pumps  
Many taller buildings or buildings with high-piled combustible storage require a fire pump to  
supply adequate pressures and flows for the automatic sprinkler system or standpipe system. The  
fire pump can be located within the building, or located outside. Since the fire pump is expected  
to operate for the duration of the fire in the building, it must be protected. The fire pump room  
must be separated from the remainder of the building by at least 2-hour fire-resistance-rated  
construction in high-rise buildings and 1-hour construction in all other buildings if they are fully  
sprinklered. If the fire pump is located outside, NFPA 20 “Standard for the Installation of  
Stationary Fire Pumps for Fire Protection” requires that it is located at least 50 feet \(15,240 mm\)  
from the building which protects it from an exposure fire. See Figure 913-1.  
Additional issues to be addressed for the protection of the fire pump are freezing concerns and  
power supply. The pump room must be maintained above 40°F \(5°C\). This is necessary to keep  
the water from freezing or becoming slush in the small piping of many of the components and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcontrols in the pump room. Even though water freezes at 32°F \(0°C\), it will start to form ice  
crystals and become slushy as the temperature approaches freezing. The threshold of 40°F \(5°C\)  
is also used when determining whether a fire sprinkler system can be a wet-pipe sprinkler system  
or dry-pipe sprinkler system. Where located outside of a protected pump room, electrical circuits  
needed for the survivability and operation of the fire pump must be protected by 1-hour  
construction, listed cables with a fire-resistance rating of 1-hour or be encased in concrete.

Section 914 Emergency Responder Safety Features  
Section 914 is intended to provide correlation to the current requirements in the IFC for the  
identification of shaftway hazards and the location of fire protection systems and controls for  
utility and mechanical equipment. These requirements are located in Sections 316.2 and 509.1 of  
the IFC. Section 101.3 of the IBC states that the safety of emergency responders is part of its  
scope and purpose. This section reinforces that purpose by specifying that interior and exterior  
shaftway hazards be identified as well as the location of fire protection systems, such as fire  
alarm control units or automatic sprinkler risers, and rooms housing HVAC and elevator  
controls.  
Section 915 Carbon Monoxide Detection  
Carbon monoxide is an odorless and colorless gas, and it can be deadly. Carbon monoxide is  
produced when the use of a solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel does not result in a complete  
combustion process. In these instances, carbon monoxide is produced. Some examples where  
carbon monoxide can be produced are a gas or wood fireplace, a gas stove,  
heating/ventilation/air-conditioning equipment powered by fuel oil or gas, and a vehicle stored in  
the garage. Non-fire-related carbon monoxide fatalities in the United States average 430 per year,  
based on a 12-year study by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Carbon monoxide  
detectors, with exceptions, are required in all dwelling units, sleeping units, and classrooms  
served by a fuel-burning appliance, a fuel-burning fireplace, or an attached private garage. Open  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand enclosed parking garages do not trigger this requirement where they comply with Section  
406.5 or 406.6 due to the requirement for natural or mechanical ventilation.  
In residential-type occupancies where carbon monoxide \(CO\) alarms are required, they are to  
be installed in locations similar to smoke alarms. At least one CO alarm is required on each floor  
with sleeping units and located outside of each sleeping area, but in the immediate vicinity of the  
sleeping rooms. When more than one CO alarm is provided, they must be interconnected. Where  
the potential CO source is in a sleeping room or bathroom, a CO alarm must be installed within  
the sleeping room. In Group E, they shall be installed inside each classroom. The primary power  
supply is the building wiring, and each CO alarm must have a battery backup. See Figure 915-1.  
Section 916 Gas Detection Systems  
Figure 915-1 Carbon monoxide alarms in a dwelling unit.  
Gas detection systems are required to detect leaks in many uses and hazardous operations as  
regulated by both the IBC and IFC. For example, gas detection systems are required in  
semiconductor fabrication facilities, hydrogen fuel gas rooms, refrigerated liquid CO2 beverage  
dispensing operations, extraction facilities using flammable gases, areas of storage and use of  
highly toxic or toxic gases, and ozone gas generator rooms, along with other situations where gas  
detection is used as an option to ventilation. This section addresses the general requirements for  
gas detection systems.  
Each gas detection system must be designed for use with the specific gas being detected.  
Secondary power is required unless the gas detection system provides a trouble signal at an  
approved location upon power loss.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe process of detection is intended to be a continuous ongoing process. However, for HPM  
gases, the detection system must obtain a sample at least every 30 minutes. A sampling interval  
of 5 minutes is permitted where the gas detection system is provided in lieu of an exhaust  
treatment system as allowed for toxic gases in accordance with IFC Section 6004.2.2.7. The  
sample is evaluated, and when the gas concentration exceeds 25 percent of the lower flammable  
limit \(LFL\) for flammable gases, or one-half of the IDLH \(immediately dangerous to life and  
health\) for nonflammable gases, the system shall activate a visible alarm or audible signal.  
Section 917 Mass Notification Systems  
In-building mass notification provides real-time information and messages to building  
occupants by voice communication or visible text, graphics, or signals.  
Wide-area mass notification can provide real-time information and messages to outdoor  
areas.  
An evaluation of the need of a mass notification system on college and university campuses is  
addressed in this section, triggered when there are multiple buildings on the campus and the  
aggregate occupant load of those buildings is 1,000 or more. NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm and  
Signaling Code addresses two types of mass notification\: in-building mass notification and wide-  
area mass notification.  
A risk analysis must be completed to determine if mass notification is required. The risk  
analysis is to evaluate fire and non-fire emergencies, such as geological events, meteorological  
events, biological events, human-caused intentional events, human-caused accidental events, and  
technical events. The mass notification system must provide prerecorded messages and have the  
capability of delivering live voice messages.  
If the risk analysis indicates that an emergency communication system is necessary for mass  
notification, then a mass notification system must be provided. The risk analysis is required prior  
to building construction, so it should be available at the time of plan review.  
KEY POINTS  
• Automatic sprinkler systems are typically installed because they are mandated by the  
code, or because they are to be used as equivalent protection to other code  
requirements.  
• Because of the potentially high occupant load and density anticipated in Group A  
occupancies, coupled with the occupants’ probable lack of familiarity with the means  
of egress system, large assembly uses must be protected by an automatic sprinkler  
system.  
• Most school buildings must be sprinklered throughout unless complying  
compartmention is provided.  
• Large manufacturing buildings and warehouses, when containing combustible goods or  
materials, must be sprinklered to limit the size of a fire.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation• The IBC requires sprinkler protection for all Group H occupancies owing to local  
hazards within the building and the potential for presenting a high level of hazard to the  
surrounding properties.  
• Because the mobility of the occupants of Group I occupancies is greatly diminished, the  
code requires an automatic sprinkler system in such occupancies.  
• On account of their fire record, hotels, apartment buildings, assisted-living facilities,  
and all other residential occupancies must always be sprinklered.  
• Adequate openings must be provided in exterior walls for fire department access, or a  
sprinkler system must be installed.  
• Standpipe systems are typically required based upon the building’s height or number of  
stories.  
• The required locations of Class I standpipe connections are specifically identified in the  
code.  
• The required locations of Class II standpipe hose cabinets are based on the distances  
that the fire hose can reach throughout the building.  
• One of the most effective means of occupant notification in case of a fire incident is the  
availability of a fire alarm system.  
• Pressurization, airflow, and exhaust are the three methods of mechanical smoke control.  
• A ventilated smokeproof enclosure uses either an exterior balcony or a ventilated  
vestibule, whereas pressurization of the stair or ramp shaft or the exit enclosure and its  
vestibule is a permitted alternative.  
• Smoke and heat vents or a mechanical smoke removal system is required in large, open  
areas of manufacturing and warehouse occupancies, as well as retail sales with high-  
piled stock.  
• Carbon monoxide detection is required under specific conditions in dwelling units,  
sleeping units, and classrooms.  
• A risk analysis is required to determine if a mass notification system is required for  
larger college and university campuses.

Key Points  
This chapter establishes the basic approach to determining a safe exiting system for all  
occupancies. It addresses all portions of the egress system and includes design requirements as  
well as provisions regulating individual components, which may be used within the egress  
system. The chapter specifies the methods of calculating the occupant load that are used as the  
basis of designing the system and, thereafter, discusses the appropriate criteria for the number of  
exits, location of exits, width or capacity of the egress system, and the arrangement of the  
system. This arrangement is treated in terms of remoteness and access to the egress system. The  
issue of access handled both in terms of the system’s usability by building occupants and in  
terms of it being available within a certain maximum distance of travel. After having dealt with  
general issues that affect the overall system or multiple zones of the system defined as the exit  
access, exit, and exit discharge, the chapter then establishes the design requirements and  
components that may be used to meet those requirements for each of the three separate zones.  
In interpreting and applying the various provisions of this chapter, it would help to understand  
the four fundamental concepts on which safe exiting from buildings is based\:  
1\. A safe egress system for all building occupants must be provided.  
2\. Throughout the system, every component and element that building occupants will  
encounter in seeking egress from the building must be under the control of the person  
wishing to exit.  
3\. Once a building occupant reaches a certain degree or level of safety, as that occupant  
proceeds through the exiting system, that level of safety is not thereafter reduced until the  
occupant has arrived at the exit discharge, public way, or eventual safe place.  
4\. Once the exit system is subject to a certain maximum demand in terms of the number of  
persons, that system must thereafter \(throughout the remainder of the system\) be capable  
of accommodating that maximum number of persons.  
Egress for individuals with physical disabilities is to be provided under the provisions of this  
chapter, primarily through the design of an accessible means of egress system. Because many of  
the elements composing the egress system \(doors, landings, ramps, etc.\) may also form part of  
the accessible routes as required by Chapter 11, such requirements must be referenced where  
applicable.  
The IBC® uses a three-part approach to the “means of egress.  
” The three-part system, or zonal  
approach as it is now used, was introduced by the National Fire Protection Association  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation\(NFPA\) in 1956 and was incorporated over the years into all of the legacy model codes. This  
approach has established terms that are used throughout the design and enforcement  
communities to deal with the means of egress system. The three parts of the means of egress  
system are the exit access, the exit, and the exit discharge. For conceptual ease, the exit access  
is generally considered any location within the building from where you would start your  
egress travel, and continues until you reach the door of an exit. The exit access would include  
all the rooms or spaces that you would pass through on your way to the exit. This may be the  
room you are in; an intervening room; a corridor; an exterior egress balcony; and any doors,  
ramps, unenclosed stairs, or aisles that you use along that path. An exit is the point where the  
code considers that you have obtained an adequate level of safety so that travel distance  
measurements are no longer a concern. Exits will generally consist of fire-resistance-rated  
construction and opening protection that will separate the occupants from any problem within  
the building. Elements that are considered exits include exterior exit doors at ground level,  
interior exit stairways, interior exit ramps, exit passageways, exterior exit stairways, exterior  
exit ramps, and horizontal exits. Exterior exit doors, exterior exit stairways, and exterior exit  
ramps will not provide the fire-protection levels that the other elements provide, but insofar as  
the occupant will be outside the building, they will provide a level of safety by removing the  
occupants from the problem area. The last of the three parts is the exit discharge. The  
International Building Code® \(IBC\) will generally view exterior areas at ground level as the  
exit discharge portion of the exit system. Therefore, the exit access will be the area within the  
building that gets the occupants to an exit, whereas the exit discharge will be the exterior areas  
at grade where the occupants go upon leaving the building in order to reach the public way.  
Section 1001 Administration  
This section requires that every building or portion thereof comply with provisions of Chapter  
10\. In dealing with portions of buildings, it is important to understand that the code intends this  
chapter to apply to all portions that are occupiable by people at any time. Therefore, areas such  
as storage rooms and equipment rooms, although often unoccupied, will still be regulated under  
the provisions of the chapter.  
In order to provide an approved means of egress at all times, it is critical that the exiting  
system be maintained appropriately. Section 1032 of the International Fire Code® \(IFC®\)  
regulates maintenance of the means of egress for the life span of the building. Should there be  
alterations or modifications to any portion of the building, Section 1001.2 mandates that the  
number of existing exits not be reduced, nor the capacity or width of the means of egress be  
decreased, below that level required by the IBC. Section 1104 of the IFC also provides a limited  
number of specific provisions addressing the means of egress in existing buildings.  
Section 1002 Maintenance and Plans  
While Chapter 10 of the IBC and IFC are generally identical, the IFC includes a Section 1032  
which addresses the maintenance of the means of egress. This information is not included within  
the IBC due to the code’s scoping, and therefore a reference to the IFC is provided.  
A reference to the IFC provisions addressing fire safety, evacuation, and lockdown plans  
recognizes the need to provide consistent and effective fire- and life-safety operations during  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationemergency conditions. Section 404 of the IFC requires the fire-safety and evacuation plans in  
those occupancies and building types as set forth in IFC Section 403. These plans are required to  
include or address a number of different types of issues that may affect the egress of occupants  
from the building. Along with other items, these include the identification of potential hazards,  
exits, primary and secondary egress routes, and occupant assembly points, as well as establishing  
procedures for assisted rescue for people who are unable to use the general means of egress  
unassisted.  
Section 1003 General Means of Egress  
The requirements and topics addressed in this section are used as basic provisions and are to be  
applied throughout the entire egress path as applicable. Examples of the types of general issues  
that are found here include ceiling height, protruding objects, floor surface, elevation change,  
and egress continuity. For consistency purposes, the provisions for ceiling height and protruding  
objects are identical to the accessibility criteria of ICC A117.1.  
1003.2 Ceiling height. In order to provide an exit path that maintains a reasonable amount of  
headroom clearance for the occupants, this section requires the means of egress to have a  
minimum ceiling height of 7 feet 6 inches \(2,286 mm\). The intent of the provision is to address  
all potential paths of exit travel that can be created based on multiple directions of egress and the  
layout of the room or space insofar as furniture, equipment, and fixtures are concerned. Any  
portion of the floor area of the building that can reasonably be considered a possible exit path  
should be provided with a minimum 7-foot 6-inch \(2,286-mm\) clear height, unless reduced by  
exceptions permitted for sloped ceilings, dwelling and sleeping units in residential occupancies,  
stairway and ramp headroom, door height, and protruding objects. Additional exceptions reduce  
the minimum required clear height to 7 feet 0 inches \(2,134 mm\) in parking garage vehicular and  
pedestrian traffic areas as well as above and below floors considered as mezzanines.  
1003.3 Protruding objects. Limitations are placed on the permitted projection of protruding  
objects for two purposes. First, to maintain an egress path that is essentially free of obstacles.  
Second, to provide a circulation path that is usable by all occupants, including those individuals  
with sight-related disabilities. For this reason, provisions regulate the accessibility concerns  
regarding protruding objects as well as the egress concerns. Note that projections into the  
required egress width and the minimum clear width of accessible routes are also limited by other  
provisions of the code.  
1003.3.1 Headroom. Consistent with the allowance for stair headroom and doorway height to be  
reduced below the required egress height of 7 feet 6 inches \(2,286 mm\), other portions of the  
egress system may likewise be reduced to a minimum height of 80 inches \(2,032 mm\). The  
reduction for signage, sprinklers, decorative features, structural members, and other protruding  
objects is limited to 50 percent of the ceiling area of the egress path. See Figure 1003-1. Though  
projections at an 80-inch \(2,032-mm\) height are not unusual to building occupants, it is  
necessary to maintain a majority of the egress system at 7 feet 6 inches \(2,286 mm\) or higher.  
Passage through a doorway may be further reduced in height to 78 inches \(1,981 mm\) at the door  
closer or stop. This reduction at doors is also permitted for accessibility purposes by Section  
307.4 of ICC A117.1. Where a vertical clearance of 80 inches \(2,032 mm\) cannot be achieved,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe reduced-height portion of such floor area cannot be used as a portion of the means of egress  
system. It is also necessary to provide some type of barrier that will prohibit the occupant from  
approaching the area of reduced height. This is of particular importance where the occupant is  
sight impaired, with no method other than a barrier to identify the presence of an overhead  
protruding object. The mandated barrier is to be installed so that the leading edge is no more than  
27 inches \(686 mm\) above the walking surface, as shown in Figure 1003-2. By limiting the  
height of the barrier edge, it will be located in a manner so that a sight-impaired individual using  
a long cane will detect the presence of an obstruction and maneuver to avoid the hazard.  
1003.3.2 Post-mounted objects. Free-standing objects mounted on a post or pylon that are  
located along or adjacent to the walking surface are potential hazards, particularly to a sight-  
impaired individual. Objects such as signs, directories, or telephones that are mounted on posts  
or pylons are, therefore, limited to an overhang of 4 inches \(102 mm\) maximum if located more  
than 27 inches \(686 mm\), but not more than 80 inches \(2,032 mm\), above the floor level. By  
limiting the overhang to 4 inches \(102 mm\), a cane will hit the post or pylon prior to the  
individual impacting the mounted object. See Figure 1003-3. Free-standing objects mounted at or  
below 27 inches \(686 mm\) will fall within the cane-detection zone, and objects mounted at 80  
inches \(2,032 mm\) or higher are sufficiently above the walking surface. Similar concerns are  
addressed where the obstruction is mounted between posts located more than 12 inches \(305  
mm\) apart. Unless the lowest edge of the obstruction is at least 80 inches \(2,030 mm\) above the  
walking surface, it must be located within the cane recognition area extending from the walking  
surface to a height of 27 inches \(686 mm\).  
Figure 1003-1 Means of egress headroom.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1003-2 Reduced vertical clearance.  
Figure 1003-3 Post-mounted protruding objects.  
1003.3.3 Horizontal projections. Consistent with the other provisions for protruding objects,  
horizontal projections such as structural elements, fixtures, furnishings, and equipment are  
considered hazardous where they fall outside of the area where cane detection can identify them.  
Visually impaired individuals cannot detect overhanging objects when walking alongside them.  
Because proper cane techniques keep people some distance from the edge of a walking surface  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationor from walls, a slight overhang of no more than 4 inches \(102 mm\) is not considered hazardous.  
An example of this provision is illustrated in Figure 1003-4. An exception permits handrails to  
protrude up to 4½ inches \(114 mm\).  
Although the provisions of this section, as well as those in Sections 1003.3.1 and 1003.3.2,  
are primarily based on clearances established for accessibility purposes, their value to all users of  
any circulation path is considerable. Projections into the means of egress potentially could result  
in a reduced travel flow, resulting in longer evacuation times during emergency conditions. In  
addition, injuries are possible to individuals who fail to pay proper attention to where they are  
going.  
1003.4 Slip-resistant surface. As evidenced by the requirements for ceiling height and  
protruding objects, the potential for exit travel to be impeded by obstructions is addressed  
throughout Chapter 10. Various provisions attempt to eliminate the opportunity for hazards along  
the exit path to slow travel. This section recognizes one area that is often taken for granted when  
it comes to egress—the floor surface of the means of egress. It is typically assumed that a floor  
surface that provides adequate circulation, and often accessibility, throughout a building will be  
acceptable for egress purposes as well. Although this is usually true, it is stated in the code that  
the egress path should have a surface that is slip resistant and securely at tached so there is no  
tripping or slipping hazard that would result in an obstruction of the ex iting process. Although  
the regulation of floor surfacing materials is typically recognized for interior circulation paths,  
the provision is also applicable to exterior egress paths. The performance criteria of this code  
section provide a basis for determining the appropriateness of any questionable exit discharge  
elements.  
Figure 1003-4 Limits of protruding objects.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1003.5 Elevation change. The code is concerned that along the means of egress there is no  
change in elevation along the path of exit travel that is not readily apparent to persons seeking to  
exit under emergency conditions. Therefore, along the means of egress, any change in elevation  
of less than 12 inches \(305 mm\) must be accomplished by means of a ramp or other sloping  
surface. A single riser or a pair of risers is not permitted. See Figure 1003-5. Steps used to  
achieve minor differences in elevation frequently go unnoticed and as a consequence can cause  
missteps or accidents.  
This limitation on the method for a change of elevation, however, does not apply in certain  
locations. Where Section 1010.1.4 permits a level change at a door, a level change along the  
egress path could occur in certain occupancies and locations. See Figure 1003-6. A second  
exception allows, under specific conditions, a stair with a single riser or with two risers and a  
tread at those locations not required to be accessible by Chapter 11. In this case, the risers and  
treads must comply with Section 1011.5, but the tread depth must be at least 13 inches \(330  
mm\), and a minimum of one complying handrail must be provided within 30 inches \(762 mm\) of  
the centerline of the normal path of egress travel on the stair. See Figure 1003-7. A third  
exception applies to seating areas not required to be accessible. Risers and treads may be used on  
an aisle serving the seating where a complying handrail is provided.  
Figure 1003-5 Longitudinal section through corridor or other exit path.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1003-6 Single step at exterior door.  
1003.6 Means of egress continuity. This section emphasizes that wherever the code imposes  
minimum widths on components in an exiting system, such widths are to be clear, usable, and  
unobstructed. Nothing may project into these required capacities and minimum widths so as to  
reduce the usability of the full dimension, unless the code specifically and expressly states that a  
projection is permitted. Two notable examples of permitted projections are doors, either during  
the course of their swing or in the fully open position, and handrails. The limitations on the  
amount of such projections are specified within the appropriate sections of the chapter.  
Additionally, this section places into code language one of the four basic concepts that were  
previously discussed—that once the exit system is subject to a certain maximum demand in  
terms of number of persons, that system must thereafter be capable of accommodating that  
maximum number of persons.  
1003.7 Elevators, escalators, and moving walks. For a variety of reasons, elevators, escalators,  
and moving walks are not to be used to satisfy any of the means of egress for a building. These  
building components are intended for circulation purposes and do not conform with the detailed  
egress requirements found in Chapter 10. The only exception is for elevators used as an  
accessible means of egress as addressed in Section 1009.4, which truly is more of a means of  
assisted rescue.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1003-7 Elevation change.  
Section 1004 Occupant Load  
1004.1 Design occupant load. This section prescribes a series of methods for determining the  
occupant load that will be used as the basis for the design of the egress system. The basic  
concept is that the building must be provided with a safe exiting system for all persons  
anticipated in the building. The process for determining an appropriate occupant load is based on  
the anticipated density of the area under consideration. Because the density factor is already  
established by the code for the expected use, variations in occupant load are simply a function of  
the floor area assigned to that use. It is apparent that in many situations the occupant load as  
calculated is conservative in nature. This is appropriate because of the extent that the means of  
egress provides for life-safety concerns. The egress system should be designed to accommodate  
the worst-case scenario, based on a reasonable assumption of the building’s use.  
1004.2 Cumulative occupant loads. This provision mandates that the occupant loads are to be  
cumulative as the occupants egress through intervening spaces. Under the conditions of Section  
1016.2, the path of travel through the intervening space must be discernable to allow for a  
continuous and obvious egress path. Egress travel is permitted to pass through complying  
adjoining rooms provided the design occupant load is increased to account for those potential  
occupants who are assigned to that specific egress path. See Figure 1004-1. Another common  
application occurs as users of the means of egress merge at aisles, corridors, or stairways, as  
shown in Figure 1004-2. Where alternative means of egress are provided, only the number of  
occupants assigned to each of the egress paths is used in the cumulative occupant load  
determination. See Figure 1004-3. Where significant occupant loads are anticipated such that a  
room or space requires at least two means of egress, the provisions of Section 1005.5 must also  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbe considered for the proper distribution of the occupant load capacity.  
Figure 1004-1 Combination occupant loads.  
Figure 1004-2 Number of combination example.  
The practice of accumulating occupants along the means of egress also applies vertically  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwhere travel from a mezzanine level leads into a room on an adjacent level, rather than directly  
into an enclosure for an interior exit stairway. Where travel occurs within the story, occupant  
loads are to be cumulative vertically as well as horizontally. An example is shown in Figure  
1004-4.  
Where the means of egress occurs on stairways that connect two or more stories, Section  
1005.3.1 indicates that the capacity of the exitways be based on the individual occupant loads of  
each story. In other words, the number of persons for which the capacity of the stairway is  
designed is not based on any cumulative total number of persons, but rather on the required  
capacity of the exits at each particular story. In no case, however, shall exit capacity decrease  
along the path of egress travel. A more in-depth discussion of this issue is found in Section  
1005.1 and is illustrated in Figure 1005-2. Where exiting occurs from a mezzanine, the  
provisions of Section 1004.2.2 apply rather than those of Section 1005.3.1. A mezzanine is  
considered a portion of the story it is located in and therefore Section 1004.2.2 is used for  
mezzanines instead of the provisions for adjacent stories.

1004.4 Multiple occupancies. In many buildings there are two or more occupancies. Quite  
often, one or more of the egress paths from an individual occupancy will merge with egress paths  
from other occupancies. Within each individual occupancy, the means of egress shall be  
designed for that specific occupancy. However, where portions of the means of egress serve two  
or more different occupancies, the more restrictive requirements of the occupancies involved  
shall be met. An example might be where a sizable assembly occupancy shares an exit path with  
a business use. The more restrictive requirement for panic hardware would be applicable for any  
doors encountered along the shared egress route.  
1004.5 Areas without fixed seating. The vast majority of buildings contain uses that do not use  
fixed seating. Unlike auditoriums, theaters, and similar spaces, in most instances the maximum  
probable number of occupants may not be known. Therefore, the code provides a formula for  
determining an occupant load that constitutes the minimum number of persons for which the  
exiting system must be designed. As a consequence, the code refers to the number obtained by  
the formula as the design occupant load. Egress systems for all buildings or building spaces must  
be designed to accommodate at least this minimum number. Basic examples of the use of Table  
1004.5 are illustrated in Figure 1004-5.  
As the person responsible for interpreting and enforcing the code, the building official will be  
called on to make decisions regarding the categories listed in Table 1004.5. Although Table  
1004.5 contains occupant load factors that will serve the code user under most conditions, there  
will be occasions when either the table does not have an occupant load factor appropriate for the  
intended use or the occupant load factor contained in the table will not have a realistic  
application. In such instances, the building official has the authority to establish an appropriate  
occupant load factor or an appropriate occupant load for those special circumstances and those  
special buildings.  
It may be meaningful to point out that the first column of Table 1004.5 is headed “Function of  
Space.  
” The categories listed in the first column are not the specific groups identified in Chapter  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation3 for the purpose of assigning an occupancy classification but are the basic generic uses of  
building spaces. It has been pointed out in the discussion of the various occupancy groups that it  
is possible to have a classroom classified as a Group E occupancy, a Group B occupancy, or,  
possibly, a Group A occupancy. In terms of occupant density, however, a classroom is a  
classroom, and it is reasonable to expect the same density of use in a classroom regardless of the  
occupancy group in which that classroom might be classified. Therefore, the table specifies that  
when considering classroom use, one must assume there is at least one person present for each  
20 square feet \(1.86 m2\) of floor area.  
In specifying how the occupant load is to be determined, the code intends that it is to be  
assumed that all portions of a building are fully occupied at the same time. It may be recognized,  
however, that in limited instances not all portions of the building are, in fact, fully occupied  
simultaneously. An example of this approach for support uses might include conference rooms in  
various occupancies or minor assembly areas such as lunch rooms in office buildings or break  
rooms in factories. It is important to note that the code does not provide for a method to address  
such conditions; thus, full occupancy should always be assumed. Only under rare and unusual  
circumstances should the building official ever consider reducing the design occupant load  
because of the nonsimultaneous use concept. In such situations, he or she must determine that  
there are support spaces that ordinarily are used only by persons who at other times occupy the  
main areas of the building; therefore, it is not necessary to accumulate the occupant load of the  
separate spaces when calculating the total occupant load of the floor or building. It is always  
necessary, however, to provide each individual space of the building with egress as if that  
individual space was fully and completely occupied.  
Another type of support area that must be considered in occupant-load calculation includes  
corridors, closets, toilet rooms, and mechanical rooms. These uses are typical of most buildings  
and are to be included by definition in the gross floor area of the building. A quick review of  
Table 1004.5 will show that most of the uses listed are to be evaluated based on gross floor area,  
with no reduction for corridors and the like. However, a few of the listings indicate the use of the  
net floor area in the calculation of the occupant load. An example would be the determination of  
an occupant load in a school building. The building official should calculate the occupant load in  
such buildings using only the administrative, classroom, and assembly areas. It is generally  
assumed that when corridors, restrooms, and other miscellaneous spaces are occupied, they are  
occupied by the same people who are at other times occupying the primary use spaces.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1004-5 Design occupant load examples.  
The occupant load that can be expected in different buildings depends on two primary factors  
—the nature of the use of the building space and the amount of space devoted to that particular  
use. Different types of building uses have a variety of characteristics. Of primary importance is  
the density characteristic. Therefore, in calculating the occupant load of different uses, by means  
of the formula, the minimum number of persons that must be assumed to occupy a building or  
portion thereof is determined by dividing the area devoted to the use by that density  
characteristic or occupant load factor. The second column of Table 1004.5 prescribes the  
occupant load factor to be used with respective corresponding uses listed in the first column. The  
occupant load factor does not represent the amount of area that is required to be afforded each  
occupant. The IBC does not limit, except through the provisions of Section 1004.5.1, the  
maximum occupant load on an area basis. Rather, the occupant load factor is that unit of area for  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwhich there must be assumed to be at least one person present. For example, when the code  
prescribes an occupant load factor of 150 gross for business use, it is not saying that each person  
in an office must be provided with at least 150 square feet \(13.94 m2\) of working space. Rather,  
it is saying that, for egress purposes, at least one person must be assumed to be present for each  
150 square feet \(13.94 m2\) of floor area in the business use. It is important to note that the floor  
area to be used in the application of Table 1004.5, both net and gross, is to include counters and  
showcases in retail stores, furniture in dwellings and offices, equipment in hospitals and  
factories, and similar furnishings. The floor areas occupied by furniture, equipment, and  
furnishings are taken into account in the occupant load factors listed in the table.  
The numbers contained in the second column of Table 1004.5 represent those density factors  
that approximate the probable densities that can usually be expected in areas devoted to the  
respective functions listed. For this purpose, the occupant load factors are really a means of  
estimating the probable maximum density in the varying function areas. They have been  
developed over a period of years and, for the most part, have been found to consistently represent  
the occupant/furnishing densities that one might expect in building spaces devoted to the  
respective uses. Where multiple occupancies or functions occur, Sections 1004.3 and 1004.4  
provide guidance to address the egress issues. See Application Examples 1004-1 and 1004-2 for  
two methods of occupant load determination.  
Application Example 1004-1  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1004-2  
The exception to this section allows for a reduction in the calculated design occupant load on  
a very limited case-by-case basis. The building official is granted authority for the discretionary  
approval of lesser design occupant loads than those established by calculation. Although the  
provision allows the building official to be accommodating by recognizing the merits of the  
specific project, its use should be limited to very unique situations such as extremely large  
manufacturing or warehousing operations. See Application Example 1004-3. Where the  
exception is enacted in order to reduce the occupant load, the building official will typically  
impose specific conditions to help ensure compliance. It is critical that the reasoning for the  
occupant load reduction be justified and documented.  
1004.5.1 Increased occupant load. The provisions of Section 1004.5 specify the method to be  
used in determining the anticipated occupant load for areas without fixed seating. The occupant  
load determined by this method is the minimum number of persons for which the exiting system  
must be designed. The provisions do not, as previously pointed out, intend that the maximum  
permitted occupant load be regulated or controlled on a floor-area basis other than in the manner  
described by this section.  
The provisions of this section specify how the maximum permitted occupant load in a  
building or portion of the building is to be determined. Here, the approach is taken that the  
occupant load determined as previously provided may be increased where the entire egress  
system is adequate, in all of its parts, to accommodate the increased number. In no case,  
however, shall the occupant load be established using an occupant load factor of less than 7  
square feet \(0.65 m2\) of floor space per person. See Application Example 1004-4.  
In order to analyze any increased occupant load, the building official must carefully review all  
aspects of the arrangement of space as well as the details of the total egress system, not only  
from the immediate space but continuously through all other building spaces that might  
intervene. In many cases, a diagram will be required indicating the approved furnishing and  
equipment layout.  
Although it is critical that the building’s means of egress system be designed to accommodate  
the increased occupant load, all other code requirements that are based on the number of  
occupants must also be reviewed based on the increased number. For example, if it is intended to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationincrease the calculated occupant load of 258 in a Group A-3 conference facility to 340  
occupants, all code requirements shall be applied based on the occupant load of 340. This would  
include the provisions of Section 903.2.1.3 that require an automatic sprinkler system, those of  
Section 907.2.1 mandating a manual fire alarm system, and the main exit requirements of  
Section 1030.2. An additional occupant-load-based provision that must be considered is that for  
plumbing fixtures as addressed in Section 2902.  
Application Example 1004-3  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1004-4  
1004.6 Fixed seating. The method of calculating occupant load discussed to this point—that is,  
the formula that divides an appropriate occupant load factor into the amount of space devoted to  
a specific function—is used when dealing with building spaces without fixed seating. Where  
fixed seats are installed, the code specifies that the occupant load be determined simply by  
counting the number of seats. Although the code does not define the term fixed seats, it is  
intended by this term that the seats provided are, in fact, fastened in position, not easily movable,  
and maintained in those fixed positions on a more or less permanent basis. A primary example of  
a fixed-seat facility would be a performance theater. In determining the occupant load for this  
type of facility, only the number of fixed seats is used because the code also requires that the  
space occupied by aisles may not be used for any purpose other than aisles and, therefore, may  
not be used for accommodating additional persons. The aisle system within a fixed-seating  
facility is, in fact, the exiting system for those fixed seats and, as such, must remain  
unobstructed. Therefore, the code does not assume any occupancy in the areas that make up the  
aisles.  
Under varying circumstances, fixed-seating assembly spaces may include other assembly  
areas capable of being occupied. Such areas could include wheelchair spaces, waiting areas,  
and/or standing room. Performance areas and similar spaces would also be evaluated and  
assigned an appropriate occupant load. The occupant load of all such areas must be added to that  
established for the fixed seating in the calculation of the total occupant load per Section 1004.3.  
An example is shown in Figure 1004-6. The inclusion of these additional occupiable areas  
provides for a more accurate determination of the potential number of persons who could occupy  
the room or space.  
In addition to those fixed-seating arrangements where the seating is provided by a chair-type  
seat, there will be those that use continuous seating surfaces such as benches and pews. When  
this type of seating is provided, it is necessary to assume at least one person present for each 18  
inches \(457 mm\) of length of seating surface. Where seating is provided by use of booths, as is  
frequently done in restaurants, it must be assumed that there is a person present for each 24  
inches \(610 mm\) of booth-seating surface. If the booth seating is curved, the code specifies that  
the booth length be measured at the backrest of the seating booth. Where seating is provided  
without dividing arms, such as for benches and booths, it is reasonable to base the occupant load  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationindividually to each bench or booth. Similarly, it is appropriate to round the calculated occupant  
load down to the lower value, as this section only regulates each full 18 inches or 24 inches of  
width. See Application Example 1004-5.  
The method for determining occupant load in a small restaurant is depicted in Application  
Example 1004-6.  
1004.7 Outdoor areas. Occupiable roofs, yards, patios, and courts that are used by occupants of  
the building must be provided with egress in a manner consistent with indoor areas. This  
provision is applicable to outdoor areas, including building rooftops, that are occupied for a  
variety of uses, but is primarily applied to outdoor dining at restaurants and cafés. The building  
official shall assign an occupant load in accordance with the anticipated use of outdoor areas. If  
an area’s occupants need to pass through the building to exit, the cumulative total of the outdoor  
area and the building shall be used to determine the exiting requirements. This concept is  
consistent with the provisions of Section 1004.2.1. See Figure 1004-7.  
Application Example 1004-5  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAnother example that is becoming more common is that of secured exterior areas serving  
nursing homes \(Group I-2\) or assisted living facilities \(Group I-1, R-3, or R-4\). Such exterior  
spaces are often provided to enhance the livability of the facilities by providing outdoor spaces  
where the patients or residents are free to roam without individual supervision. When evaluating  
these spaces for egress purposes, there are several issues to consider. If the secured yard is  
provided with a means of egress independent of the facility, the gates must comply with all of the  
requirements for egress doors. Electric locking systems, sensor release devices, delayed egress  
devices, or controlled locking systems installed in accordance with Sections 1010.2.11 through  
1010.2.14, as applicable, would be permitted as a means of addressing occupant safety for these  
areas. Without compliant gates, the means of egress must be designed for travel back through the  
facility. The facility must also egress independent of the secured yard unless all means of egress  
from the secured exterior area comply with the code.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1004-6  
The judgment of the building official is very important to the application of these provisions  
because the building official must determine exactly what occupant load should be considered  
and to what degree the area is accessible and usable by the building occupants in order to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationestablish the egress requirements. Some cases that will require judgment include large spaces  
that might have a very limited anticipated occupant load such as areas that are primarily for the  
service of the building. Where a portion of the required means of egress for the outdoor area is  
provided independent of travel back through the building, or where all of such required egress  
must pass through the building, the applicable provisions would generally be similar to those for  
travel through intervening spaces or comply with Exception 8 in Section 1010.2.4. The  
distribution of the occupant load from the outdoor area will depend on how many exits are  
required and how many means of egress paths are available.  
Figure 1004-6 Occupant load determination for fixed seating.  
1004.9 Posting of occupant load. Where a room or space is to be used as an assembly  
occupancy, this section requires the posting of a sign indicating the maximum permitted  
occupant load. This sign serves as a reminder to the occupants of the space, as well as building  
employees, that any larger occupant load would create an overcrowded condition. In order to be  
effective, the sign must be conspicuously located near the main exit or exit access doorway from  
the room or space, and must be permanently maintained. An example of an occupant load sign is  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationshown in Figure 1004-8. Where multiple uses causing varying occupant loads are anticipated, it  
is appropriate to designate the maximum occupant load for each use, as shown in Figure 1004-9.

1005.1 General. This section establishes the method for sizing the capacity of the egress system,  
and more specifically, the minimum required capacity of each individual component in that  
system. It also establishes the method for distributing egress capacity to various egress paths  
where multiple means of egress are provided.  
There are two methods established by this section for the determination of the minimum  
required width/capacity of the means of egress all along the various egress paths. These methods  
are typically referred to as “component” width and “calculated” width. The greater width or  
capacity required for each egress element based on component width and calculated width is to  
be applied in the design of the means of egress system. Component width, addressed in Section  
1005.2 as minimum width, is specified throughout the code based on the specific means of  
egress component under review. As an example, the minimum required component width of a  
corridor is based on Table 1020.3. Calculated width, addressed in Section 1005.3 as required  
capacity, is determined based on the appropriate formula as established in Section 1005.3.1 for  
stairways and Section 1005.3.2 for egress components other than stairways. It is important to  
note again that the greater required width as established by component width and calculated  
width is to be provided. See Application Example 1005-1.  
Section 1030 provides special means of egress requirements for those rooms, spaces, and  
areas used for assembly purposes. Where an assembly use contains seats, tables, displays,  
equipment, or similar elements, the requirements set forth in Section 1030 for aisles and aisle  
accessways are to be applied in addition to the general means of egress requirements of Chapter  
10.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1005-1  
1005.2 Minimum width based on component. Egress components all have a minimum width  
established by other provisions in the code. It should be noted that where the component width is  
the appropriate method for determining egress width, in many situations the required component  
widths may lessen along the egress path. For example, in an office building with an occupant  
load of 68 persons, a corridor required to be at least 44 inches \(1,118 mm\) in width by Table  
1020.3 may lead to an exit door with a minimum clear width of 32 inches \(813 mm\) as regulated  
by Section 1010.1.1. In this example, the minimum component widths for the corridor and the  
exit door provide for greater widths than the capacity required by Section 1005.3.2.  
1005.3 Required capacity based on occupant load. The formula for means of egress capacity  
based on occupant load is very succinct. It states that the total required capacity of the means of  
egress shall not be less than that obtained by multiplying the total occupant load served by an  
egress component by the appropriate factor as set forth in Section 1005.3.1 or 1005.3.2, as  
applicable. It should be noted that the calculation of egress capacity for aisles and aisle  
accessways in assembly occupancies is not regulated by this section, but rather is governed by  
Section 1030.6. Where an assembly space contains seats, tables, displays, equipment, or other  
fixtures or furnishings, it must comply with the means of egress provisions of Section 1030.  
In designing the means of egress system, it is first necessary to determine the occupant load  
that must be accommodated through each individual portion of the system. The occupant load  
anticipated to be served by each individual component is the basis for sizing each component.  
The design occupant load is to be used when determining both the component width and the  
calculated width. Continuing to use a corridor as an example, Table 1020.3 requires a minimum  
component width of 44 inches \(1,118 mm\) where serving an occupant load of 50 or more, but  
only 36 inches \(914 mm\) where serving an occupant load less than 50. For calculated width  
\(required capacity\), multiplying the occupant load by the appropriate factor in Section 1005.3.1  
or 1005.3.2 will result in the minimum required capacity in inches \(mm\) necessary to  
accommodate the occupant load. An example is shown in Application Example 1005-2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1005-2  
It cannot be emphasized too strongly that when the code discusses width in terms of an egress  
system or component, it is referring to the clear, unobstructed, usable width afforded along the  
exit path by the individual components. Therefore, if it is determined, for example, that a means  
of egress must have a width of at least 3 feet \(914 mm\), it shall be arranged so that it is possible  
to pass a 36-inch-wide \(914-mm\) object through that egress path and each of its components.  
Unless the code specifically states that a projection is permitted into the required width by  
Section 1005.7, nothing may reduce the width of the component required to provide the  
necessary exit capacity.  
Egress width in assembly spaces. As previously mentioned, where the provisions of Section  
1030 are applicable for assembly uses, the egress width and capacity of aisles and aisle  
accessways shall be determined based on such provisions. The requirements of Section 1030  
regulate all assembly spaces containing seats, tables, displays, equipment, or other material.  
Thus, it is typical that the egress capacity requirements of Section 1030.6 are to be followed  
rather than those of Section 1005.1. Section 1030.6 addresses egress capacity for assembly uses,  
based primarily on whether or not smoke-protected assembly seating is provided. A further  
discussion of this subject is provided in the analysis of Section 1030.  
1005.3.1 Stairways. This provision establishes the method for determining the required capacity  
of an egress stairway, based on the occupant load assigned to the stairway. As a basic  
requirement, the capacity of a stairway is based on the occupant load assigned to the stairway  
multiplied by 0.3 inches per occupant. Where the building is provided with both an automatic  
fire sprinkler system and an emergency voice/alarm communication system, a factor of 0.2  
inches per occupant is to be used. The presence of these two fire-protection systems allows for a  
33 percent reduction in the minimum required calculated egress capacity. Again, the minimum  
required component width must also be addressed. This reduction to 0.2 inches per occupant is  
not permitted in Group H and I-2 occupancies.  
Provided the occupants are traveling in the same direction, there is no need to combine the  
loads from adjacent stories. The IBC assumes that in exiting multistory buildings there will be  
occupants feeding into the exit stairs at various stories. This approach recognizes that using the  
cumulative occupant load for vertical travel often results in stairway widths of significant size.  
The reduced sizes established by the floor-by-floor method may result in some increase in  
occupant evacuation time; however, the slower evacuation rate is deemed acceptable since the  
travel occurs within a fire-resistance-rated enclosure. This is in contrast to the methodology  
applied to horizontal travel where cumulative occupant loads must be addressed due to the fact  
that such travel is typically in unprotected portions of the exit access. The capacity factors are  
substantially higher for stairways than for horizontal egress components, primarily because the  
speed of exiting on a stair is substantially less than the speed of exiting on level or nearly level  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsurfaces. On stairways there is a forced reduction in normal stride, as the length of stride on a  
stair must coincide with the stair’s run. A study of this difference shows that a stairway requires  
an increase in width of approximately 50 percent above that for horizontal travel in order to  
maintain equivalent flow rates.  
At one time, building codes addressed a cascading effect when analyzing and determining the  
required width of stairs, but this concept is no longer applicable. The required width of a stair is  
calculated on a story-by-story application of the formula.  
In the design of multistory buildings, it is quite common that different stories have different  
occupant loads. Thus, the occupant load calculated for each story must be considered. As a  
matter of fact, it is not uncommon for buildings to have assembly uses on the top story. As a  
consequence of that configuration, it is entirely possible that the top story of a building will have  
an occupant load greater than any other. Under such a condition, it will be necessary to calculate  
the required stairway capacity based only on the occupant load of the uppermost story. This  
required capacity must be maintained through the successive stories until it serves a greater  
occupant load from a lower story or until the occupants have reached the public way or ultimate  
safe place. Figure 1005-1 illustrates this requirement.  
It should be noted that the same concept of determining stairway width that is discussed above  
applies where building occupants exit upward through the stairway. This is the situation in  
buildings with basements and sub-basements. Occupants of those below-grade floors must exit  
up the stairway, onto the landing on the ground floor, and then out through the exterior exit door  
from that landing. The largest capacity calculated from any floor level will be the controlling  
factor of the exit at ground level, as well as the exit doorway from the stairway. Of course, it is  
possible that occupants on the ground floor will exit through an enclosure of an interior exit  
stairway. If so, the required capacity determined based on that condition may govern. However,  
the ground floor usually has adequate width of exits independent of any paths through the  
stairway enclosures. Thus, the occupant load of the ground floor is usually not an issue in the  
determination of the exterior exit doorway capacity from the stairway enclosure. In any case, the  
occupant load of the ground floor would not be added to any occupant load of floors above for  
determining egress capacity from the building. Where upper and lower floors converge at an  
intermediate level, see the discussion of Section 1005.6 on egress convergence.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1005-1 Width of exits—multistory buildings example.  
1005.3.2 Other egress components. A means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inches per  
occupant applies to those egress components other than stairways, such as doorways, ramps,  
aisles, and corridors. The factor may be reduced in all occupancies other than Groups H and I-2,  
provided the building is fully sprinklered and provided with an emergency voice/alarm  
communication system. Where both of these fire-protection features are provided, the capacity  
factor may be reduced to 0.15 inches per occupant.  
1005.4 Continuity. As stated earlier, it is the width of the most restrictive component that  
establishes the capacity of the overall exit system. To ensure that a design does not reduce the  
capacity at some point throughout the remainder of the egress system, this section stipulates that  
the width and capacity may not be reduced and that the design must accommodate any  
accumulation of occupants along the path. Therefore, once the required width or capacity is  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdetermined for any story \(in fact, from any room or other space\), that required width or capacity  
must be maintained until the occupants have reached the public way or ultimate safe place. It is  
important to remember that because different factors are used to determine the requirements for  
stairways than for all other components, it is really the required capacity, not the minimum  
width, of the egress system that is not permitted to be reduced. An aisle, door, corridor, exit  
passageway, or other horizontal egress component located at the bottom of any stairway may  
generally be reduced in width from what is required for the stairway. See Application Example  
1005-3\. This is simply due to the capacity factor of the stairway being greater than the factor for  
other egress elements. It must again be mentioned that only the required width or capacity needs  
to be maintained. The actual width of the means of egress may be reduced throughout the travel  
path as long as the required width is provided. A common application of this concept is shown in  
Figure 1005-2.  
1005.5 Distribution of minimum width and required capacity. When the required egress  
capacity of the system has been determined by the use of one of the formulas, and the required  
number of exit access doorways or exits has been determined in accordance with the provisions  
of Section 1006, the required egress capacity can be divided among the number of required  
means of egress. In fact, where additional complying means of egress are provided above the  
number required by the code, they too can be used for distribution purposes. The manner of  
distribution shall be such that the loss of any one means of egress will not reduce the available  
capacity to less than 50 percent of that required. Thus, after the loss of one means of egress, at  
least one-half of the required capacity must be available. See Application Example 1005-4. It is  
the intent of this section that there be reasonable distribution of the egress capacity necessary to  
serve a given occupant load.  
The primary reason for requiring multiple egress paths is the fact that in a fire or other  
emergency, it could be possible that at least one of the routes will be unavailable or blocked by  
fire. If the egress capacity was concentrated at one exit point, it could very easily be that path  
that affords the greatest portion of the egress capacity that would be lost. The resulting limitation  
on the occupants’ ability to exit a building or portion thereof is simply unacceptable. In addition,  
the presence of two or more means of egress allows for a distribution of occupants, which should  
provide for more efficient and orderly egress under emergency conditions. A third benefit of  
egress distribution is the potential reduction in the distance occupants must travel to reach an exit  
or exit access doorway.

1005.6 Egress convergence. This section directly addresses those situations where occupants  
from floors above and below converge at an intermediate level, rather than traveling in the same  
direction, as discussed in Sections 1005.3.1 and 1004.2.3. The code states that the proper  
approach for this condition would be to add the occupant loads together—a method that is also  
used when converging aisles or merging corridors. In these cases, it can be assumed that the  
occupants arrive at the same point at the same time and, therefore, the capacity of the system  
must accommodate the sum of these converging floors. See Figure 1005-3. Although the code  
does not specify the approach to be taken where there are multiple floors both above and below  
the intermediate level of discharge, it is anticipated that the same methodology of convergence  
would be applied. For example, the occupant load assigned from a second-level basement would  
be added to the occupant load assigned from the third floor, resulting in a congregate occupant  
load converging at the discharge level. The minimum required egress capacity would be based  
on the highest of the occupant loads that have been established.  
1005.7 Encroachment. Where doors open into the path of exit travel, they create obstructions  
that may slow or block egress. Therefore, the code limits the encroachment of doors into the  
required exit width. A door opening into a path of egress travel may not, during the course of its  
swing, reduce the width of the exit path by more than one-half of its required width. When fully  
open, the door may not project into the required width by more than 7 inches \(178 mm\). It is  
important to recognize that the provisions are based on the exitway’s required width, not its  
actual width.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAgain, as discussed in connection with Sections 1010.1.5 and 1011.6 for doors swinging over  
a stairway landing, it might be better to think of the permitted obstruction of a door during the  
course of its swing from a positive viewpoint. So stated, each door, when swinging into an egress  
path such as an aisle or a corridor, must leave unobstructed at least one-half of the required width  
of the path of travel during the entire course of its swing. At least one-half of the required width  
must always be available for use by the building occupants. When the door is in its fully open  
position, the required egress width, minus 7 inches \(178 mm\), must be available. See Figure  
1005-4.  
Figure 1005-3 Egress convergence example.  
Figure 1005-4 Egress obstruction due to door swing.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIn applying the requirements for projections, the code imposes these limitations on a door-by-  
door basis. It is desirable, but not required that doors be arranged so as not to have two doors  
directly opposing each other on opposite sides of the exit path. Better design would avoid this  
arrangement. The intent of the code is that at least one-half of the required width of the exitway  
be available for use by the building occupant as illustrated in Figure 1005-5. The restrictions on  
door swing do not apply to doors within dwelling units and sleeping units of Groups R-2 and R-  
3.  
Figure 1005-5 Doors swinging into egress path.  
Where nonstructural projections other than doors, such as trim and similar decorative features,  
extend into the required width of a means of egress component, the limit on their projection into  
the required width of egress components is 1½ inches \(38 mm\) unless such projection is  
specifically prohibited by the code. In reviewing the provisions for aisles in Section 1018.1,  
corridors in Section 1020.4, and exit passageways in Section 1024.2, the encroachments  
established in this section are specifically permitted. Handrail projections are also permitted  
provided such projections do not extend beyond the limitations established in Section 1014.8. Of  
specific note is a reference to Section 407.4.3 regarding permissible projections into the required  
width of nursing home corridors.  
Section 1006 Number of Exits and Exit Access Doorways  
For the purposes of determining the minimum number of means of egress required to serve a  
building’s occupants, it is important to note that the code first looks at exiting from each  
individual room, space, or area within the building. The means of egress is then regulated for  
each story and any occupied roof.  
1006.2.1 Egress based on occupant load and common path of egress travel distance. It  
would seem obvious that every occupied portion of a building must be provided with access to at  
least one exit or exit access doorway. It is assumed that if buildings are occupied, then the  
occupants obviously have a method of entering the various building spaces. Therefore, that same  
entrance is usually available to serve as the means of egress. Under many conditions, however,  
the use of the entrance as the only egress point is insufficient. The basic reason for requiring at  
least two means of egress is that in a fire or other emergency, it is very possible that the entry  
door will be obstructed by the fire and, therefore, not be usable for egress purposes. A second  
exit or exit access doorway can provide an alternative route of travel for occupants of the room  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationor area. However, it is often unreasonable to require multiple egress paths from small spaces or  
areas with limited occupant loads. It is also seldom beneficial because of the relatively close  
proximity in which such exits or exit access doorways must be located. Therefore, the code does  
not require a secondary egress location from all rooms, areas, or spaces where in compliance  
with Table 1006.2.1.  
The IBC establishes two basic criteria for providing adequate egress for occupants from any  
space within the building. First, at least two exits or exit access doorways must be provided when  
the occupant load of the space exceeds the values set forth in Table 1006.2.1. Second, two or  
more egress doorways are required when the common path of egress travel exceeds the  
limitations also established in Table 1006.2.1. Only where both the design occupant load of the  
room, space, or mezzanine and the common path of egress travel distance set forth in Table  
1006.2.1 are not exceeded is it permissible to have a single means of egress. See Application  
Examples 1006-1 and 1006-2.  
Application Example 1006-1  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1006-2  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1006-3  
Figure 1006-1 Common path of egress travel.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1006-2 Merging paths of travel.  
As seen in Table 1006.2.1, the allowance for a single exit or exit access doorway from a space  
varies based on the occupancy designation of the space. The variations are caused by conditions  
associated with the specific uses that occur within the room or area. Factors that contribute to the  
differences in occupant load include the concentration of occupants, occupant mobility, and the  
presence of hazardous materials. Exception 1 recognizes that the occupant load does not affect  
the number of exits from a foyer or lobby where spaces egress through them. However, the  
required capacity of the exit from the foyer or lobby is to be based on the total cumulative  
occupant load served. See Application Example 1006-3. The second exception references the  
provisions of Section 407.4.4 for Group I-2 care suites, while the third exception addresses  
unoccupied mechanical rooms and penthouses.  
In addition to the occupant load limitations imposed by Table 1006.2.1 for single exit rooms  
and spaces, the common path of egress travel distance is also strictly regulated. The definition of  
a common path of egress travel is found in Section 202. Described as “that portion of exit access  
travel distance measured from the most remote point of each room, area, or space to that point  
where the occupants have separate and distinct access to two exits or exit access doorways.  
”  
Therefore, a common path of egress travel is that portion of the exit system where only one path  
is available to the occupant, and ends only once separate paths are available to at least two  
exitways. The length of the common path is measured from the most remote point of a room or  
area to the nearest location where multiple exit paths to separate exits are available. See Figures  
1006-1 and 1006-2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAs a general rule, the maximum length of a common path of egress travel is 75 feet \(22,860  
mm\), as shown in Table 1006.2.1. Because of unique risks potentially encountered in a high-  
hazard occupancy, the common path of travel is limited to 25 feet \(7,620 mm\) in Groups H-1, H-  
2, and H-3. In certain occupancies and under specific conditions set forth in the table, an increase  
in the common path of travel to a distance of 100 feet \(30,480 mm\) or 125 feet \(38,100 mm\) is  
permitted. Other than the end point, the method of measurement of the common path of egress  
travel should be consistent with that for measuring exit access travel distance as regulated in  
Section 1017. See the discussion of Sections 1017.2 and 1017.3 for further guidance. The most  
obvious example of a “common path” condition is a room with a single exit or exit access  
doorway. Although there are numerous paths that may lead to the doorway, eventually they all  
end up at the same point. Where two or more complying exits or exit access doorways are  
provided, common path conditions do not exist.  
1006.2.2.1 Boiler, incinerator, and furnace rooms. Depending on the capacity of the fuel-fired  
equipment located in a large boiler room or similar area, it may be necessary to provide a  
secondary egress doorway because of the potential hazards. At least two exit access doorways  
are required where the room exceeds 500 square feet \(46 m2\) and any single piece of fuel-fired  
equipment such as a furnace or boiler exceeds 400,000 Btu \(422,000 KJ\) input capacity. The  
requirement is based on the size of a single piece of equipment, not the aggregate total of all fuel-  
fired equipment in the room. Access to one of the two exit access doorways may be  
accomplished through the use of a ladder or an alternating stair device. As with other multiple-  
exit situations, the two doorways must be adequately separated, in this case by a horizontal  
distance no less than one-half the maximum overall diagonal.  
1006.2.2.2 Refrigeration machinery rooms. The International Mechanical Code® \(IMC®\)  
mandates when refrigeration systems must be contained in a refrigeration machinery room. It can  
be based on the type of refrigerant, the amount of refrigerant, the type of equipment, or other  
factors. Once a refrigeration machinery room is required by the IMC, the IBC provides the  
exiting criteria. Where larger than 1,000 square feet \(92.9 m2\), the room must have at least two  
exit access doorways, accessed and separated in the same manner as described for boiler and  
furnace rooms. Egress doors from the room must be tight-fitting, self-closing, equipped with  
panic hardware, and swing in the direction of travel. Travel distance is also restricted to 150 feet  
\(45,720 mm\). It is evident that the presence of multiple exitways and a more limited travel  
distance are necessary in order to address the hazards associated with areas containing  
refrigerants.  
1006.2.2.3 Refrigerated rooms or spaces. Considered a bit less of a concern than refrigeration  
machinery rooms, rooms or spaces that are refrigerated still pose somewhat of a hazard because  
of the refrigerants used in the system. The requirements for such rooms or spaces differ little  
from those for refrigeration machinery rooms, except that the less restrictive travel distances  
apply within the room if the room or space is sprinklered and egress is permitted through  
adjoining refrigerated rooms.  
1006.3 Egress from stories or occupied roofs. This section is a continuation of the provisions  
established in Section 1006.2 relating to the minimum number of exits or access to exits required  
throughout the means of egress system. Section 1006.2 is to be applied within rooms or spaces  
within a story and identifies those conditions under which one, two, three, and four means of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationegress are required from such rooms or spaces. Section 1006.3 regulates the minimum number of  
exits or access to exits required from each story of a building. Section 1006.3.4 allowances for a  
single exit, as well as the requirements for multiple exits, are established for each individual  
story, as well as for any occupied roof.  
As few as one exit may be permitted, based on occupancy classification, occupant load, and  
story location within the building. On the other hand, up to four exits may be required based  
primarily on the occupant load of the story. In all cases, once a minimum required number of  
exits or exit access stairways has been established by the code, that number cannot be reduced.  
1006.3.2 Path of egress travel. It is possible to use a combination of interior/exterior exit  
stairways and exit access stairways for means of egress purposes. It is permissible that the means  
of egress from a story of a building consist of all exit access stairways as regulated by Section  
1019\. However, per Section 1006.3.2, the exit access stairways generally cannot pass through  
more than one adjacent story before providing access to the required exit. This limits the travel  
distance and exposure to hazards the occupants may face prior to reaching the safety of an exit.  
Vertical travel on an exit access stairway must be considered in the evaluation of travel  
distance and such travel is usually only available to a single adjacent story. The use of an exit  
access stairway as a required means of egress component is limited to one story of travel, at  
which point the occupants must use an interior exit stairway or other exit element. See the  
example in Figure 1006-3. The exceptions address situations where exit access can pass through  
more than one adjacent story prior to reaching an exit. These are typically situations where  
vertical compartmentation/separation between stories is not required or between occupied roofs.  
Figure 1006-3 Access to exits at adjacent levels.  
1006.3.3 Egress based on occupant load. As established in Table 1006.3.3, every story or  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationoccupied roof shall be provided with two exits, or access to at least two exits. A single means of  
egress is only permitted under the conditions identified in Section 1006.3.4. Table 1006.3.3  
indicates that, based solely on occupant load, three, or even four, exits may be required. Any  
story of a building that has an occupant load in excess of 500, up to and including 1,000, shall be  
provided with three exits, or access to at least three exits. Any story having an occupant load in  
excess of 1,000 must be provided with four exits, or access to not less than four exits. Under no  
circumstances does the IBC require more than four exits for any building or portion thereof  
based on the number of persons present. It must be noted, however, that additional exits will  
sometimes be required to satisfy the other egress requirements of Chapter 10. An additional  
interior exit stairway may also be required in high-rise buildings over 420 feet \(128 m\) in height  
per Section 403.5.2.  
1006.3.4 Single exits. As a general requirement expressed in Table 1006.3.3, every story and  
occupied roof shall be provided with two exits, or access to at least two exits. However, a single  
means of egress is permitted where the story or occupied roof is within the limits of Table  
1006.3.4\(1\) or Table 1006.3.4\(2\) as permitted by Exception 1, or where one of the other four  
exceptions to this section specifically permits a single exit.  
Although it is desirable that a minimum of two means of egress be provided to building  
occupants in order to provide for a more reliable and efficient evacuation process, the code  
recognizes that there are instances where the life-safety risk is so minimal that it is reasonable to  
permit a single means of egress. Under limited conditions, this allowance extends from a single-  
level basement to a three-story-above-grade-plane condition. Tables 1006.3.4\(1\) and 1006.3.4\(2\)  
identify those stories where a single exit, or access to a single exit, is permitted. The tables are  
based on varying criteria, including occupancy classification, number of stories above the grade  
plane, occupant load, number of dwelling units, and exit access travel distance. Examples  
illustrating the use of these tables are shown in Figure 1006-4. It should be noted that special  
consideration is given in Footnote b of Table 1006.3.4\(2\) for certain Group B, F, and S  
occupancies. Also illustrated in Figure 1006-4 is a permitted condition for a basement where a  
single exit is permitted. Exception 4 recognizes that all Group R-3 and R-4 occupancies may  
have a single exit, while Exception 2 addresses stories at the exit discharge level complying with  
Section 1006.2.1 for spaces requiring only one means of egress.  
Only one exit or access to a single exit is required from a story where permitted by Table  
1006.3.4\(1\) or Table 1006.3.4\(2\), regardless of the number of means of egress required from  
other stories in the building. For example, a Group B occupancy on the second story of a  
multistory building is only required to have one exit, or access to one exit, from the story,  
provided its occupant load does not exceed 29 and the maximum exit access travel distance to an  
exit does not exceed 75 feet \(22,860 mm\). The number of occupants and travel distances on the  
other stories do not affect the determination of the second story as a single-exit story. See  
Application Example 1006-4. Where applicable, other stories are also regulated independently as  
to the number of means of egress.  
The two tables referenced by Exception 1 differ only in the occupancy classifications to  
which they are applicable. Table 1006.3.4\(1\) is only to be used for Group R-2 occupancies  
consisting of dwelling units, such as apartment buildings. The allowance for a single exit, or  
access to a single exit, is regulated based on the story’s relationship to grade plane, the number  
of dwelling units on the story, and the maximum exit access travel distance provided. Complying  
emergency escape and rescue openings must also be provided in all of the dwelling units. Table  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1006.3.4\(1\) does not apply to dormitories, fraternity, sorority houses, and similar Group R-2  
occupancies comprised of sleeping units based on footnote b of the table. Table 1006.3.4\(2\)  
applies to all occupancies other than those specific Group R-2 occupancies addressed by Table  
1006.3.4\(1\). A single means of egress from each story of such occupancies is regulated by the  
occupancy classification, number of occupants per story, maximum exit access travel distance,  
and the story’s relationship to grade plane.  
Figure 1006-4 Stories with one exit examples.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1006.3.4.1 Mixed occupancies. Where multiple tenants or occupancies are located on a specific  
story, they are to be regulated independently for single-exit determination. The provisions can be  
applied to specific portions of the story, rather than the story as a whole. As an example, the  
second story of a building houses two office tenants, each with its own independent means of  
egress. Each tenant would be permitted a single, but separate, means of egress provided each had  
an occupant load of less than 30 and an exit access travel distance not exceeding 75 feet \(22,860  
mm\). This portion-by-portion philosophy also applies to a mixed-occupancy condition, provided  
each of the individual occupancies does not exceed the limitations of Table 1006.3.4\(2\). See  
Figure 1006-5. If a single or common means of egress is provided for the mixed occupancies,  
then a sum of the ratios can determine compliance.  
Application Example 1006-4  
Figure 1006-5 Stories with one exit examples.  
Section 1007 Exit and Exit Access Doorway Configuration  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIn addition to providing multiple means of egress, it is imperative that egress paths remain  
available and usable. To ensure that the required egress is sufficiently remote, the code imposes  
rather strict requirements relative to the location or arrangement of the different required exits or  
exit access doorways with respect to each other. The purpose here is to do all that is reasonably  
possible to ensure that if one means of egress should become obstructed, the others will remain  
available and will be usable by the building occupants. As a corollary, this approach assumes  
that because the remaining means of egress are still available, there will be sufficient time for the  
building occupants to use them to evacuate the building or the building space.  
1007.1.1 Two exits or exit access doorways. This remoteness rule in the IBC is sometimes  
referred to as the one-half diagonal rule. The one-half diagonal rule states that if two exits or exit  
access doorways are required, they shall be arranged and placed a distance apart equal to or  
greater than one-half of the maximum overall diagonal of the space, room, story, or building  
served. Such a minimum distance between the two means of egress, measured in a straight line,  
shall not be less than one-half of that maximum overall diagonal dimension. See Figure 1007-1  
for examples of the application of this rule. It should be noted that, by definition, the term exit  
access doorway includes any point of egress where the occupant has a single access point that  
must be reached prior to continued travel to the egress door. See Figure 1007-2.  
The use of the one-half diagonal rule has been beneficial to code users for many years. It  
quantifies the code’s intent when the code requires that separate means of egress be remote. It  
does not leave the building official with a vague performance-type statement that can, in many  
instances, result in a situation where egress separation would be dictated more by the design or  
desired layout of the building rather than by a consideration for adequate and safe separation of  
the means of egress.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1007-1 Separation of exits or exit-access doorways.  
In applying the one-half diagonal rule to a building constructed around a central court with an  
egress system consisting of an open balcony that extends around the perimeter of the court, it is  
important to take the measurement of the diagonal from which the one-half diagonal dimension  
is derived at the proper locations. Refer to Figure 1007-3 for examples.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1007-2 Egress separation.  
Figure 1007-3 Required egress separation.  
Figure 1007-4 illustrates Exception 1 to the one-half diagonal rule for those buildings, such as  
core buildings, where the means of egress are sometimes arranged in rather close proximity. The  
code recognizes the benefits of such a floor arrangement and makes a specific exception in the  
event there is such a design. If the exits or exit access doorways are connected by a fire-  
resistance-rated corridor, the distance determined by one-half of the maximum overall diagonal  
of the space served may be measured along the shortest path of travel inside the corridor between  
the two exits instead of in a straight line between the two exit doors. It is specific that the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconnecting corridor is to be of 1-hour fire-resistant construction.  
A second exception reduces the minimum length of the overall diagonal dimension between  
remote exits or exit access doorways in those buildings equipped throughout with automatic  
sprinkler systems. Because of the presence of sprinkler protection, the separation distance need  
only be one-third of the length of the overall diagonal dimension. The use of this exception  
results in a reduction of the required distance between exits or exit access doorways by 33⅓  
percent. See Figure 1007-5.  
Figure 1007-4 Core arrangement of interior exit stairways.  
Figure 1007-5 Exit separation—sprinklered building.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1007.1.1.1 Measurement point. The code specifically indicates the manner in which the  
straight-line measurement should be taken. Three measurements methods are established to  
clearly indicate how to measure between doors, stairways, and ramps. Any point within the  
width of the exit or exit access doorway may be selected by the designer for measurement  
purposes. This will typically result in measuring between the far edge of one egress doorway  
opening and the far edge of the other egress doorway opening in order to allow the greatest  
design flexibility.  
1007.1.2 Three or more exits or exit access doorways. When more than two means of egress  
are required, the remoteness rule takes on more of a performance character. In such an instance,  
at least two of the required exits or exit access doorways shall be arranged to comply with the  
one-half diagonal rule \(one-third in fully sprinklered buildings\). The other means of egress must  
be arranged at a reasonable distance from the other egress points so that if any one of the  
required exits or exit access doorways becomes blocked by a fire or any other emergency, the  
others will be available. Obviously, this decision will require some very careful evaluation and  
judgment on the part of the building official. There may be a sufficient basis for applying that  
same rule when considering each possible pair of egress components in a multi-exit situation.  
The code is silent in this particular aspect, and proper code administration does require  
substantial, careful evaluation and judgment on the part of the building official in ensuring that  
the number of means of egress required is sufficiently remote so that it is not likely that the use  
of more than one access to exit will be lost in any fire incident. A similar evaluation should be  
done where more than two exit access stairways or ramps provide the required means of egress.  
1007.1.3 Remoteness of exit access stairways or ramps. Minimum separation distances  
between exit access stairways and ramps are required to be maintained for the entire length of  
travel on the stairway or ramp. See Figure 1007-6. This requirement prohibits stairway and ramp  
runs that meet the separation distance at the first riser or beginning of the slope from converging  
toward another stair or ramp such that the separation is reduced below the minimum distance as  
the occupant goes either up or down the stairway or ramp. It is reasonable to expect the egress  
separation distance to be maintained in order to ensure a fire cannot affect both of the egress  
paths, whether it is at the beginning of the stair or ramp or at any point until the egress travel is  
completed.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1007-6 Measurement points for exit access stairways.  
Section 1008 Means of Egress Illumination  
1008.2 Illumination required. In order for the exit system to afford a safe path of travel and for  
the building occupant to be able to negotiate the system, it is necessary that the entire egress  
system be provided with a certain minimum amount of illumination. Without such lighting, it  
would be impossible for building occupants to identify and follow the appropriate path of travel.  
The lack of adequate illumination would also be the cause of various other concerns, such as an  
increase in evacuation time, a greater potential for injuries during the egress process, and most  
probably an increased level of panic to those individuals trying to exit the building. Therefore,  
the code requires that, except in a limited number of occupancies, the egress paths be illuminated  
throughout their entire length any time the building space served by the means of egress is  
occupied. The code intends that illumination be provided for those portions of the egress system  
that serve the parts of the building that are, in fact, occupied. Parts of the exiting system that  
would not be serving the occupants of the building need not, at that time, be illuminated. For  
obvious reasons, there are four exceptions that identify areas where continuous illumination  
during occupancy is not mandatory. Two exceptions address uses where sleeping is a common  
activity—dwelling units and sleeping units in Group R-1, R-2, and R-3 occupancies, and  
sleeping units in Group I occupancies. Another exception addresses utility structures designated  
as Group U, whereas a fourth exception exempts aisle accessways in Group A assembly uses.  
It is mandated that the entire means of egress serving the occupants be illuminated. Therefore,  
the exit discharge—that portion of egress travel from the building to the public way—must also  
be provided with adequate illumination. Although there are often numerous light sources at a  
building’s exterior, such as lighting for landscaping, parking lots, city streets, and adjacent  
buildings, it is important that the illumination be effective and reliable for use under this  
provision. It should also be noted that the requirements of this section are simply for general  
illumination of the entire egress system, and are not the higher level conditions for emergency  
lighting as mandated in Section 1008.3. The exception within Section 1008.2.3 will allow the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationillumination to end at safe dispersal area versus extending all the way to the public way.  
1008.2.1 Illumination level under normal power. For other than stairways, such illumination  
must be capable of producing a light intensity of not less than 1 foot-candle \(11 lux\) at the  
walking surface throughout the entire path of travel through the system. One foot-candle \(11 lux\)  
of light on a surface is not a great deal of light. It is probably not sufficient light to enable a  
person to read. However, it is sufficient light to allow a person passing through the exit system to  
distinguish objects and to identify obstructions in the actual path of travel. The light cast by a full  
moon on a clear night might approximate the 1 foot-candle \(11 lux\) light level. When the amount  
of light intensity is in doubt, it may be necessary to measure it with a light meter. On stairways  
and their associated landings, the illumination level is required to be not less than 10 footcandles  
\(108 lux\) when the stair is in use. This higher illumination level is to ensure that the walking  
surface is visible and that level changes are more apparent  
An exception recognizes that these illumination levels might interfere with presentations in  
such places as motion picture theaters and concert halls; therefore, the exception allows a  
reduction in such building uses to a level of not less than 0.2 foot-candle \(2.15 lux\). Such a  
reduced lighting level, however, is permitted only during a performance and would be brought  
up to the minimum 1 foot-candle \(11 lux\) level if a fire alarm system were activated. At this  
point it is important to remember the distinction between a stepped aisle within the assembly  
seating area and a stairway since the 10 footcandle \(108 lux\) illumination level only applies to  
stairways and not to a stepped aisle.  
A second method permits the use of self-luminous marking of the steps, landings, and ramps  
in accordance with Section 1025.  
1008.3 Emergency power for illumination. Normally, the power for illumination of the egress  
path is provided by the premises’ wiring system. However, where the potential life-safety hazard  
is sufficiently great, it is considered inadequate to solely provide the illumination of the exit  
system by such a system. In these cases, it is necessary that emergency power—a completely  
separate source of power—automatically provide illumination of the exitways. In fundamental  
terms, separate sources of power are required in all occupancies in which two or more means of  
egress are required. Therefore, any space, area, room, corridor, exterior egress balcony, or other  
portion of the egress system requiring access to at least two exits or exit access doors is to be  
provided with emergency lighting. An example of this application is depicted in Figure 1008-1.  
Also included are exit stairways, both interior and exterior, and exterior landings at exit doors in  
buildings requiring a minimum of two means of egress. Several specific rooms and spaces,  
identified in Section 1008.3.3, must also be provided with emergency power for illumination  
purposes.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1008-1 Emergency power for egress illustration.  
Where emergency power systems are required, they are to be supplied by storage batteries,  
unit equipment, or an on-site generator. It is the intent that this power source be automatically  
available even in the event of the total failure of the public utility system. Therefore, a separate,  
independent source is generally required. Installation of the emergency power system is  
regulated by referring to the requirements of NFPA 70.  
The initial illumination provided by emergency power along the path of egress at floor level  
shall average at least 1 foot-candle \(11 lux\), with a minimum level of illumination required to be  
0.1 foot-candle \(1 lux\). Illumination levels are permitted to decline over the required 90-minute  
duration of the emergency power source to an average of 0.6 foot-candle \(6 lux\) with a minimum  
at any point of 0.06 foot-candle \(0.6 lux\). Recognizing the variation in light levels throughout the  
exit path, only the average illumination level needs to be determined; however, an absolute  
minimum level of illumination must be attained. In no case shall the illumination uniformity  
ratio between the maximum light level and the minimum light level exceed 40 to 1.  
Within Group I-2 occupancies, additional redundancy is provided by the requirement that the  
failure of any single lamp \(bulb\) in the fixture does not leave the area with inadequate  
illumination.  
Section 1009 Accessible Means of Egress  
1009.1 Accessible means of egress required. In addition to the access to buildings required by  
the provisions of Chapter 11, it is important that safe egress for persons with disabilities is  
provided. Therefore, the code requires that accessible spaces be provided with accessible means  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationof egress consisting of one or more of the following components as set forth in Section 1009.2\:  
1\. 2. 3. Accessible routes complying with Section 1104.  
Interior exit stairways complying with Sections 1009.3 and 1023.  
Exit access stairways complying with Sections 1009.3 and 1019.3 or 1019.4 \(unless  
connecting levels in the same story\).  
4\. Exterior exit stairways complying with Sections 1009.3 and 1027 \(where serving floor  
levels other than the level of exit discharge\).  
5\. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. Elevators complying with Section 1009.4.  
Platform lifts complying with Section 1009.5.  
Horizontal exits complying with Section 1026.  
Ramps complying with Section 1012.  
Areas of refuge complying with Section 1009.6.  
Exterior areas for assisted rescue complying with Section 1009.7 \(where serving exits at  
the level of exit discharge\).  
At least one accessible means of egress must be provided from all accessible spaces. Where  
more than one means of egress is required from any accessible space, at least two accessible  
means of egress are required. This ensures that a person with a disability also has an egress  
option should one path be blocked. An example to illustrate this provision is a large department  
store requiring multiple exits. Although the number of required exits from the store is addressed  
in Sections 1006.2 and 1006.3, only two accessible means of egress would be required from the  
accessible space. Therefore, the store might be required to provide three or more means of  
egress, but only two accessible means of egress need to be provided.  
Two exceptions reduce or eliminate the accessible means of egress requirements. Only one  
accessible means of egress is required from accessible mezzanines, as well as from sloped-floor  
or stepped assembly spaces with limited travel to all wheelchair spaces.  
1009.2 Continuity and components. As previously mentioned in the discussion of Section  
1009.1, the code recognizes various accessible elements as components of an accessible means  
of egress. The accessible egress travel is required to extend beyond the building itself to the  
public way, unless an alternative means of protection is provided. If the egress route from the  
building to the public way is not accessible, it is acceptable to provide a complying exterior area  
of assisted rescue rather than create an accessible exit discharge path. Addressed further in the  
discussion of Section 1009.7, the exterior area of assisted rescue performs in much the same  
manner as an area of refuge inside the building.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1009-1 Elevator as accessible means of egress.  
1009.2.1 Elevators required. Unlike the general provision found in Section 1003.7 that  
specifically prohibits considering an elevator as an approved means of egress, this section  
requires an elevator for assisted rescue purposes under certain conditions. In buildings where a  
required accessible floor or occupied roof is four or more stories above or below a level of exit  
discharge, ramps and stairs cannot adequately serve as egress for individuals with a mobility  
impairment. Therefore, at least one elevator must be provided as an accessible means of egress.  
The elevator is not required to conform with Section 1009.4 in sprinklered buildings on those  
floors provided with a conforming ramp or horizontal exit.  
In the application of this provision, the second story of a typical building is considered the  
first story above the level of exit discharge. Accordingly, the building’s fifth story, or any  
occupied roof above the fourth story, is typically viewed as four stories above the level of exit  
discharge. See the discussion of Section 202 for level of exit discharge and Figure 1009-1. Under  
such conditions, a minimum of one accessible means of egress must be a complying elevator.  
1009.3 Stairways. Exit stairways are typically used as one or more of the required accessible  
means of egress in a multistory building. Increasing the width of stairs to 48 inches \(1,219 mm\)  
between the handrails allows for the minimum amount of space needed to assist persons with  
disabilities in the event of a building evacuation. The provisions for an area of refuge or, as  
specified in Exception 6 of Section 1009.3.3, a horizontal exit address the increased time needed  
for egress. The limitations of Section 1009.3.1 are intended to address exit access steps in  
assembly seating or split-level buildings, with a limited change of level, where an individual  
awaiting assistance or rescue may be required to wait in the middle of a building and not be able  
to travel toward an exit. There is no intent to prohibit the use of exit access stairways as part of  
an accessible means of egress from mezzanines and balconies as established the exception in  
Section 1009.3.1.  
The exceptions within the subsections of Section 1009.3 should not be overlooked since they  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwill often be applicable and can dramatically alter the stairway requirements. Two exceptions in  
Section 1009.3.2 remove the requirement for at least 48 inches \(1,219 mm\) of clear width  
between handrails. The 48-inch \(1,219-mm\) width is not mandated in sprinklered buildings, nor  
is it required for stairways accessed from a horizontal exit. A number of other exceptions in  
Section 1009.3.3 eliminate the general requirement for an area of refuge. Areas of refuge are not  
mandated at exit stairways serving open parking garages. In addition, areas of refuge are not  
mandated in Group R-2 occupancies and in smoke-protected or open-air assembly seating areas  
as regulated by Sections 1030.6.2 and 1030.6.3. Exception 1 addresses exit access stairways,  
eliminating any area of refuge requirement where two-way communication is provided at  
elevator landings under the provisions of Section 1009.8.  
Exception 2 in Section 1009.3.3 is the most commonly applied exception and permits the  
omission of areas of refuge in buildings protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system.  
The purpose of an area of refuge is to provide an area “where persons unable to use stairways  
can remain temporarily to await instructions or assistance during emergency evacuation.  
” Much  
of the reasoning in exempting fully sprinklered buildings from the requirement for areas of  
refuge comes from NISTIR 4770, a report issued by the National Institute of Standards and  
Technology \(NIST\) in 1992 titled Staging Areas for Persons with Mobility Impairments. The  
primary conclusion of the report was that the operation of a properly designed sprinkler system  
eliminates the life threat to all occupants regardless of their individual abilities and can provide  
superior protection for persons with disabilities as compared to staging areas. The ability of a  
properly designed and operational automatic sprinkler system to control a fire at its point of  
origin and to limit production of toxic products to a level that is not life threatening to all  
occupants of the building, including persons with disabilities, eliminates the need for areas of  
refuge.  
1009.4 Elevators. Although an elevator may be used as an accessible means of egress  
component in all multilevel facilities, it is only required as such in buildings regulated by Section  
1009.2.1\. Elevators used as accessible means of egress must comply with the operation and  
notification criteria of ASME A17.1, Section 2.27. In addition, standby power is required in  
order to maintain service during emergencies. The general requirement is that any elevator used  
as an accessible means of egress be accessed from an area of refuge or, as established in  
Exception 5, a horizontal exit. However, areas of refuge are not required in fully sprinklered  
buildings, open parking garages, smoke-protected or open-air assembly seating areas, and where  
elevators are not required to be protected by shaft enclosures. Additional information is provided  
in the discussion of Section 1009.3. In such cases, the elevator is still considered an accessible  
means of egress when in compliance with the other criteria of this section.  
1009.5 Platform lifts. Except in limited applications, a platform lift is specifically excluded as  
an acceptable element of a means of egress. The maintenance of the lift as well as the complexity  
and delay in using a platform lift are considered substantial obstacles in providing acceptable  
means of egress for persons in wheelchairs. Section 1110.9 specifically sets forth the few  
instances where platform lifts are permitted for access and, with the exception of Item 10, egress  
purposes. Where a complying platform lift is used as an accessible means of egress component,  
it must be provided with standby power, much in the same manner as an elevator used for the  
same purpose.  
1009.6 Areas of refuge. By definition, an area of refuge is an area “where persons unable to use  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstairways can remain temporarily to await instructions or assistance during emergency  
evacuation.  
” Unfortunately, the term temporary is not defined, so a number of provisions are  
applied to an area of refuge to increase the level of protection for anyone using it. These  
provisions include a size large enough to accommodate wheelchairs without reducing exit width,  
smoke barriers designed to minimize the intrusion of fire and smoke, two-way communications  
systems, and instructions on the use of the area under emergency conditions. The two-way  
communications system is intended to allow a user of the area of refuge to identify his or her  
location and needs to a central control point. Obviously, it is important that someone be available  
to answer the call for help when a two-way communications system is provided. The system  
shall have a timed automatic telephone dial-out capability to a monitoring location or 911 that  
can be used to notify the emergency services when the central control point is not constantly  
attended. Each area of refuge shall be identified by a sign with the international symbol of  
accessibility stating that it is an area of refuge.  
1009.6.3 Size. Each required area of refuge shall be sized to accommodate at least one  
wheelchair space not less than 30 inches by 52 inches \(762 mm by 1,320 mm\). Where the  
occupant load of the refuge area and the areas served by the refuge area exceeds 200, additional  
wheelchair spaces must be provided. Because wheelchair spaces are not permitted to reduce the  
required exit width and should be located so as to not interfere with access to and use of the fire  
department hose connections and valves, the designer needs to consider access to fire protection  
equipment and exit width when placing wheelchair spaces in the area of refuge.  
1009.6.4 Separation. The primary concern for individuals awaiting assistance in an area of  
refuge is the intrusion of smoke and toxic gases into the refuge area. Therefore, the code requires  
a physical separation between an area of refuge and the remainder of the building. The separation  
is to be a smoke barrier complying with the provisions of Section 709. The smoke barrier is not  
required where the area of refuge is located within an enclosure for an interior exit stairway due  
to the inherent protection provided by such an egress enclosure. It is also permissible to create an  
area of refuge through the use of a horizontal exit.  
1009.6.5 Two-way communication. Individuals awaiting assistance in an area of refuge must be  
provided with a communication means in order to contact a central control point. Where the  
central control point is not constantly attended, the area of refuge must be provided with a  
complying two-way communication system with automatic dial-out capability. Both audible and  
visible signals shall be provided. The requirements for such communication systems are  
established in Sections 1009.8.1 and 1009.8.2.  
1009.7 Exterior area for assisted rescue. Item 10 of Section 1009.2 identifies an exterior area  
for assisted rescue as an acceptable portion of an accessible means of egress provided it complies  
with this section. The primary use of an exterior area for assisted rescue is to provide an exterior  
refuge area for those occupants unable to complete their egress travel due to the lack of an  
exterior accessible route from the building to the public way. Where exterior steps or other  
inaccessible site elements are present between the building’s discharge level and the public way,  
it is permissible to use an exterior area for assisted rescue as an alternative to a fully accessible  
exterior path. Sized in accordance with Section 1009.6.3, the exterior area for assisted rescue in a  
nonsprinklered building must be separated from the interior of the building in a manner similar  
to that addressed for egress courts and exterior exit stairways. For nonsprinklered buildings, the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationexterior wall protecting the landing shall be protected for 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) horizontally to both  
sides with a minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated wall with any openings protected for at least ¾  
hour and from the ground level to a point at least 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) above the floor level of the  
exterior area for assisted rescue. Such protection need only extend to the roof line if it is less than  
10 feet \(3,048 mm\) vertically above the floor level of the exterior area for assisted rescue. See  
Figure 1009-2. In lieu of the 10 foot horizontal protection of the exterior wall, a wing wall which  
is perpendicular to the exterior wall and extends a minimum of 4 feet is permitted. The required  
extent of an exterior area for assisted rescue is not described in the code, requiring an individual  
evaluation where the size of the exterior area for assisted rescue becomes quite large. For an  
outdoor space to be considered an exterior refuge area, it must be at least 50-percent open so that  
toxic gases and smoke do not accumulate. Where an exterior stairway serves the exterior area for  
assisted rescue, an adequate distance between the handrails is mandated. In addition, complying  
signage is required per Section 1009.9, Item 2, to identify the exterior area as an appropriate  
refuge location. Where site restrictions or other conditions do not allow for the installation of an  
exterior area for assisted rescue, the exception in Section 1009.6.2 does permit the use of an area  
of refuge within the building on the level of exit discharge.  
Figure 1009-2 Exterior area for assisted rescue.  
1009.8 Two-way communications. Unless provided in areas of refuge in multistory buildings,  
two-way communications systems must be located at the elevator landing of each accessible  
floor level other than the level of exit discharge. The system is intended to offer a means of  
communication to individuals who need assistance during an emergency situation. Such a system  
can be useful not only in the event of a fire but also in the case of a natural or technological  
disaster by providing emergency responders with the location of individuals who will require  
assistance in being safely evacuated from floor levels above or below the discharge level. See  
Figure 1009-3.  
The first exception exempts the requirement for locating the communication systems at the  
elevator landings where the building is provided with complying areas of refuge. Since areas of  
refuge are required by Section 1009.6.5 to be equipped with two-way communication systems,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthere is limited need to provide such additional systems at the elevator landings. However, where  
multistory buildings are not provided with areas of refuge, such as is the case with most  
sprinklered buildings, the installation of communications systems at the elevator landings is  
important to those individuals unable to negotiate egress stairways during an emergency. As a  
result, most sprinklered and nonsprinklered multistory buildings must be provided with the  
means for two-way communications at all accessible floor levels other than the level of exit  
discharge. A second exemption applies to floor levels that use exit ramps as vertical accessible  
means of egress elements. Where complying ramps are available for independent evacuation,  
such as occurs in a sports arena, the two-way communications system is not required at the  
elevator landings. It should also be noted that multistory buildings without elevators, such as  
those identified in Section 1104.4, would not be regulated by this section. Thus in other than  
Group I-2 or I-3 facilities, all multistory buildings, except those exempted by Exception 2 and  
those without elevators, are required to be provided with two-way communication systems  
unless the only elevators in the building are freight, service, or private residence elevators.  
Figure 1009-3 Two-way communication system at elevator landing.  
The arrangement and design of the two-way communication system are specified in Section  
1009.8.1\. In addition to the required locations specified in Section 1009.6.5 for areas of refuge or  
Section 1009.8 for elevator landings, a communication device is also required to be located in a  
building’s fire command center or at a central control point whose location is approved by the  
fire department. The term “central control point” is not a defined term. However, given the intent  
and function of the two-way communication system, a central control point is a location where  
an individual answers the call for assistance and either provides aid or requests aid for an  
impaired person. A central control point could be the lobby of a building constantly staffed by a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsecurity officer, a public safety answering point such as a 9-1-1 center, a central supervising  
station, or possibly any other constantly staffed location. The key functions at the central control  
point are that an individual is always available to answer the call for assistance and can either  
provide assistance or is capable of requesting assistance. In addition, the communication system  
provides visual signals for the hearing impaired and audible signals to assist the vision impaired.  
Guidance to the users of the two-way communication system is also specified. Operating  
instructions for the two-way communication system must be posted and the instructions are to  
include a means of identifying the physical location of the communication device. If a signal  
from a two-way communication system terminates to a public safety answering point, such as a  
fire department communication center, current 9-1-1 telephony technology only reports the  
address of the location of the emergency—it does not report a floor or area from the address  
reporting the emergency. The “identification of the location” required by Section 1009.8.2 and  
posted adjacent to the communication system should ensure that most discrete location  
information can be provided to the central control point. This will aid emergency responders,  
especially in high-rise buildings or corporate campuses with multiple multistory structures.  
1009.11 Instructions. Instructions on the use of the area of refuge or exterior area for assisted  
rescue must be provided where applicable. The intent of the instructions is not only to provide  
directions on the use of the communication equipment, but also to alert the users as to other  
available means of egress.  
Section 1010 Doors, Gates, and Turnstiles  
1010.1 General. This section applies to doors, gates, turnstiles or doorways that occur at any  
location in the means of egress system. The provision found in Section 1022.2 should also be  
noted insofar as it will require that at least one exterior door that meets the size requirements of  
Section 1010.1.1 be provided from every building used for human occupancy. As doors pose a  
potential obstruction to free and clear egress, they are highly regulated.  
Additional doors. The IBC establishes criteria for all egress doors, including those that are not  
required by Chapter 10. Such additional egress doors must comply with all the provisions of  
Section 1010 for exit doors. Where the doors are installed for egress purposes, whether or not  
required by the IBC, the building occupant would probably assume that they are a part of the  
means of egress system. Because the building occupant would then expect the door to provide a  
safe path from the space, it is imperative that such doors and doorways conform to all applicable  
code requirements of Section 1010. Two examples are shown in Figures 1010-1 and 1010-2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1010-1 Additional door.  
Figure 1010-2 Additional door.  
Door identification. The primary gist of the provisions on door identification is that egress  
doors should be installed so that they are readily recognized as egress doors and are not confused  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwith the surrounding construction or finish materials. It is important that they be easily  
discernible as doors provided for egress purposes. The corollary of this requirement is that exit  
doors should not be concealed. In other words, they should not be covered with drapes or  
decorations, nor should they be provided with mirrors or any other material or be arranged in a  
way that could confuse the building occupants seeking an exit.  
1010.1.1 Size of doors. The size of doors is regulated for both their ability to provide clear and  
efficient egress in emergencies and to function as a part of the building’s general circulation  
system. Therefore, doors are generally to be of such a size as to provide a clear opening width of  
at least 32 inches \(813 mm\), as illustrated in Figure 1010-3, with a minimum clear opening door  
height of 80 inches \(2,032 mm\). Again, the code requires that the net dimension of clear width be  
provided by the exit component. Thus, when a swinging door is opened to an angle of 90 degrees  
\(1.57 rad\), it must provide a net unobstructed width of not less than 32 inches \(813 mm\) and  
permit the passage of a 32-inch-wide \(813-mm\) object, unless a projection into the required  
width is permitted by Section 1010.1.1.1. Where a pair of doors is installed without a mullion,  
only one of the two leaves is required to meet the 32-inch \(813-mm\) requirement. As a final  
requirement, a minimum 41½-inch \(1,054-mm\) means of egress doorway width to facilitate the  
movement of beds is mandated for those portions of Group I-2 occupancies where bed  
movement is likely to occur.  
The exceptions address a number of situations where the door size is allowed to be reduced  
since the door will not greatly impact accessibility, egress, or general circulation. In Group I-3  
occupancies, door openings to other than Accessible sleeping units need only have a clear width  
of at least 28 inches \(711 mm\). Accessible user passage door openings within Type B dwelling  
units are permitted a minimum clear width of 31¾ inches \(806 mm\). Exception 11 establishes a  
minimum clear opening width of 20 inches \(508 mm\) for doors serving nonaccessible single-user  
shower or sauna compartments, toilet stalls or dressing, fitting or changing rooms.  
In addition, minimum door-opening widths are totally unregulated in the following locations\:  
1\. Door openings in nonaccessible units of Group R-2 and R-3 occupancies that are not part  
of the required means of egress.  
2\. 3. Storage closet doors where the closet is less than 10 square feet \(0.93 m2\) in area.  
In I-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4, interior egress doors within a dwelling unit or sleeping unit not  
required to be an Accessible unit, Type A unit or Type B unit.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1010-3 Minimum clear opening width of egress door.  
Figure 1010-4 Egress door width.  
The code does not generally limit the maximum size of a door since regardless of the size, the  
door would still need to open within the force limitations set by Section 1010.1.3. Exceptions 4  
and 5 direct the user to the revolving and power-operated door provisions but neither section sets  
a maximum door size. Exception 10 does limit the maximum door width to 60 inches \(1,524  
mm\) for doors to small walk-in freezers and coolers.  
The required clear width of door openings shall be maintained up to a height of at least 34  
inches \(864 mm\) above the floor or ground. Projections may then encroach up to 4 inches \(102  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmm\) for a height between 34 inches \(864 mm\) and 80 inches \(2,032 mm\). See Figure 1010-4.  
The maximum 4-inch \(102-mm\) limitation is based partially on those accessibility provisions  
regarding protruding objects. Its application allows for the intrusion of panic hardware, or similar  
door-opening devices, into the required clear width. At a height of 80 inches \(2,032 mm\) or more  
above the walking surface, the projection is not regulated.  
Although the general requirement for the clear opening door height is a minimum of 80 inches  
\(2,032 mm\), the exceptions to Sections 1003.3.1 and 1010.1.1.1 permit door closers, overhead  
door stops, power door operators, and electromagnetic door locks to encroach into this clear  
height, provided a headroom clearance of at least 78 inches \(1,981 mm\) is maintained.  
Exceptions 6 and 7 in Section 1010.1.1 permit door openings at least 78 inches \(1,981 mm\) in  
height within a dwelling unit or sleeping unit and a minimum height of 76 inches \(1,930 mm\) for  
all exterior door openings in nonaccessible dwelling units other than the required exit door. Only  
Exception 6 along with the previously mentioned exceptions in Sections 1003.3.1 and 1010.1.1.1  
are applicable to the height reduction at a required exit door; therefore, required means of egress  
door openings must have a minimum clear opening height of 80 inches \(2,032 mm\), but may be  
78 inches \(1,980 mm\) where complying projections exist.  
1010.1.2 Egress door types. This section requires that every egress door, with exceptions, be of  
the side-hinged swinging, pivoted, or balanced door type. In most instances, it is necessary that  
the egress door encountered be of a type that is familiar to the user and easily operated.  
Therefore, swinging doors are required under all but the following conditions\:  
1\. Private garages, office, factory and storage areas, and similar spaces where the occupant  
load of the area served by the doors does not exceed 10. Because of the limitation in  
occupant load and potential hazard, other types of egress doors are considered acceptable.  
A common application of this allowance is the use of overhead doors at self-storage  
facilities.  
2\. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Detention facilities classified as Group I-3 occupancies. The security necessary in this  
type of use calls for special types of doors.  
Critical care or intensive care patient room within suites of health-care facilities. In these  
areas, it is often preferable to use sliding glass doors to allow for visual observation and  
the efficient movement of equipment.  
Within or serving an individual dwelling unit in Group R-2 and R-3 occupancies. Because  
of the limited occupant loads involved, and the familiarity of the occupants with the doors  
encountered, door types other than swinging doors are permitted.  
Revolving doors conforming with Section 1010.3.1, where installed in other than Group  
H occupancies. In other than hazardous occupancies, the use of revolving doors is  
acceptable subject to the special conditions as set forth in the code.  
Special purpose horizontal sliding, accordion, and folding door assemblies complying  
with Section 1010.3.3, where installed in other than Group H occupancies. Conditions for  
the use of such doors make them equivalent to other doors used in egress situations.  
Power-operated doors in compliance with Section 1010.3.2. Safeguards provided for  
power-operated doors create an acceptable level of safety.  
Bathroom doors within individual sleeping units of Group R-1 occupancies. It is often  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbeneficial to use sliding pocket doors to provide access to hotel bathrooms, mostly due to  
the minimum 32-inch \(813-mm\) width requirement for doors in Group R-1 occupancies.  
Conflicts often occur between door swings and the required clearances for plumbing  
fixtures or clear floor space required at bathroom doors.  
9\. The use of a typical horizontal sliding door that is operated manually, such as a “pocket”  
door or a sliding “patio” door, is deemed acceptable in those instances where the occupant  
load served by the door is very low.  
In addition, any side-hinged swinging, pivoted or balanced door serving an area or room with  
an occupant load of 50 or more, or those serving any Group H occupancy, shall swing with the  
flow of egress travel. In 1942, 492 people died in the Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire in Boston.  
One of the significant contributing factors to that loss of life was the fact that the exterior exit  
doors swung inward. As a consequence, it was not possible to open the doors because of the  
press of the crowd attempting to exit the building. This incident was identified as the primary  
reason for changing building codes to require that, under certain circumstances, exit doors must  
swing in the direction of exit travel.  
1010.1.3 Forces to unlatch and open doors. This section differentiates between the force to  
unlatch the door by operating the door hardware itself and then the force needed to open the  
door. The code establishes the maximum force limits for each. Any type of push or pull hardware  
must operate at a maximum 15-pound \(67 N\) force while hardware that operates by rotation, like  
a lever hardware or doorknob, could not require a force exceeding 28 inch-pounds \(315 N-cm\).  
To move the door to an open position, interior swinging doors, other than fire doors, must have a  
maximum opening force of 5 pounds \(22 N\). All other swinging, sliding, or folding doors as well  
as fire doors, are to be set in motion with a maximum force of 30 pounds \(132 N\) but once  
moving must open with not more than a 15-pound \(67 N\) force. These forces are applied to the  
latch side of the door. Most doors are openable with forces less than these maximum limits.  
However, when in doubt, the actual force required can be easily measured by use of a spring  
scale.  
1010.1.4 Floor elevation. The purpose of this section is to avoid any surprises to the person  
passing through a door opening, such as a change in floor level. Therefore, it is necessary that a  
floor or landing be provided on each side of a doorway. It is further intended that such a floor or  
landing should be at the same elevation on both sides of the door. A variation up to ½ inch \(12.7  
mm\) is permitted because of differences in finish materials. See Figure 1010-5. Landings are  
required to be level, except exterior landings may have a slope of not more than ¼ inch per foot  
\(6.4 mm per m\) for drainage purposes.  
Exceptions for individual dwelling units of Group R-2 and R-3 occupancies. An allowance is  
provided for individual dwelling units where it is permissible to open a door at the top step of an  
interior flight of stairs, provided the door does not swing out over the top step. The reason for  
permitting this type of arrangement in dwelling units is that as a building occupant approaches  
such a door from the nonstairway side, he or she must back away from the door in order to open  
it. This creates the need for a minimum landing to be traversed before the occupant can proceed  
to step down onto the stairs. In this situation, with minimal occupant load and familiarity with  
the unusual condition, the opening may occur at the top of the stairs, but the door must swing out  
toward the person descending the stairs. In an ascending situation, the stair user should have little  
difficulty in opening the door while standing on the stair treads, insofar as the door swings in the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdirection of travel. See Figure 1010-6.  
Figure 1010-5 Floor elevation.  
In a Type B dwelling or sleeping unit as provided in Chapter 11, a maximum drop-off of 4  
inches \(102 mm\) is permitted between the floor level of the interior of the unit down to an  
exterior deck, patio, or balcony. This limited elevation change is consistent with the level of  
accessibility provided for travel throughout a Type B dwelling unit.  
Exception for exterior doors. In Group F, H, R-2, and S occupancies exterior doors not  
required to be accessible, a single step having a maximum riser height of 7 inches \(178 mm\) is  
permitted. Where the exterior door serves a Group U occupancy or individual units of Group R-2  
or R-3 that are not required to be accessible, the landing can be a maximum of 7¾ inches \(197  
mm\) below the interior side. Under both exceptions the door, other than screen or storm doors, is  
not permitted to swing out over the exterior landing.  
1010.1.5 Landings at doors. This section contains the dimensional criteria for landings. It deals  
only with those landings where there is a door installed in conjunction with the landing.  
Landings at stairways and ramps are regulated by Sections 1011.6 and 1012.6, respectively.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1010-6 Floor level at doors.  
Required width of landings. The minimum required width of a landing is determined by the  
width of the stairway or the width of the doorway it serves. Figure 1010-7 depicts these  
relationships. The requirement is that the minimum width of the landing be at least equal to the  
width of the stair or the width of the door, whichever is greater. The code is concerned that doors  
opening onto landings should not obstruct the path of travel on the landing. In this regard, the  
code establishes two limitations. The first states that when doors open onto landings, they shall  
not project into the required dimension of the landing by more than 7 inches \(178 mm\) when the  
door is in the fully open position. Second, whenever the landing serves an occupant load of 50 or  
more, doors may not reduce the dimension of the landing to less than one-half its required width  
during the course of their swing. Stated from the positive direction, it requires that doors  
swinging over landings must leave at least one-half of the required width of the landing  
unobstructed. Although the obstruction of one-half of the required width of the landing might  
seem excessive, it must be remembered that when the door is creating such an obstruction, it is in  
a position where it is free to swing and the obstruction is not fixed in place. These requirements  
are illustrated in Figure 1010-8.  
Required length of landings. In addition to the width requirements, landings must generally  
have a length of at least 44 inches \(1,118 mm\) measured in the direction of travel. Where the  
landing serves Group R-3 and U occupancies, as well as landings within individual units of  
Group R-2, the length need only be 36 inches \(914 mm\). These code requirements are illustrated  
in Figure 1010-9.  
It should be noted that these minimum dimensions for landings in both width and length will  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbe modified by the provisions in Chapter 11 where the door or doorway is a portion of the  
accessible route of travel.  
Figure 1010-8 Doors at landings.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1010-7 Width of landing at doors.  
Figure 1010-9 Length of landings at doors.  
1010.1.6 Thresholds. Raised thresholds make using doors more difficult for people with  
disabilities. In addition, thresholds with abrupt level changes present a tripping hazard. As a  
general rule, raised thresholds should be eliminated wherever possible. Where thresholds are  
provided at doorways, it is necessary to limit their height to provide easy access through the  
doorway. Changes in floor level and raised thresholds are limited to ½ inch \(12.7 mm\) in height  
above the finished floor or landing. Where raised thresholds or changes in floor level exceed ¼  
inch \(6.4 mm\), the transition shall be achieved with a beveled slope of 1 unit vertical to 2 units  
horizontal \(1\:2\) or flatter. See Figures 1010-10 and 1010-11. For a sliding door serving a  
dwelling unit, a maximum ¾-inch \(19.1-mm\) threshold is permitted. The threshold height at  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationexterior doors may be increased to a maximum height of 7¾ inches \(197 mm\) in Group R-2 and  
R-3 occupancies, but only where such doors are not a required means of egress door, are not on  
an accessible route, and are not part of an Accessible unit, Type A unit or Type B unit.  
1010.1.7 Door arrangement. Adequate space must be provided between doors in a series to  
allow for ease of movement through the doorways. In other than dwelling units not considered  
Type A units, a minimum clear floor space of at least 48 inches \(1,219 mm\) in length is sized for  
a wheelchair user to negotiate through the door arrangement. Where a door swings into the  
space, the clear length shall be increased by the width of the door. As shown in Figure 1010-12,  
doors in a series must swing in the same direction or swing away from the space between the  
doors.  
Figure 1010-10 Threshold height.

@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1010-12 Two doors in series.  
1010.2 Door operations. This section, along with Section 1010.1.2, is particularly focused on  
the concept of ensuring that everything in the path of travel through the exit system, particularly  
doors, shall be under the control of and operable by the person seeking egress. Therefore, as a  
general statement, this section states that all doors in the egress system are required to be  
operable from the side from which egress is sought, without the need of a key or any special  
knowledge or special effort. If a key or special knowledge or effort is required, in all probability  
the door could not be readily openable by many building occupants. Such devices as  
combination locks are also prohibited on doors in exiting systems. Essentially, the code intends  
that the hardware installed be of a type familiar to most users—something that is readily  
recognizable under any condition of visibility, including darkness, and under conditions of fire or  
any other emergency.  
In addition, the hardware must be readily operable. At times, one will encounter a different  
type of device such as a thumb turn. The building official must determine if this special type of  
operating device is acceptable. In many instances, it will be necessary to ensure that the building  
occupant can, in fact, grip the operating device and operate it. Some thumb turns are so small  
that they are quite difficult to operate, while others may require multiple twisting operations to  
achieve unlocking.  
Another consideration that needs to be remembered in evaluating the acceptability of  
operating hardware is the fact that this hardware is going to be in place and in use over a  
substantial period of time. Unfortunately, doors and their operating hardware do not always get  
the constant maintenance that they should to keep them in operating order. It is imperative, in  
accordance with Section 1002.1, that the operation of doors in the egress system be maintained  
continuously in compliance with this section.  
1010.2.1 Unlatching. The installation of multiple devices, or hardware requiring multiple  
operations, is inappropriate as well. Special effort and special knowledge are often necessary to  
open a door where more than one operation is required to unlock or unlatch the door. As a result,  
the multiple operations will typically result in an unacceptable delay in the egress efforts. Four  
exceptions set forth applications where multiple unlatching or unlocking operations are  
acceptable.  
1010.2.2 Hardware. Where a door is required to be accessible under the provisions of Chapter  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation11, additional criteria come into play. It is important that all door hardware intended to be  
encountered by the door user be of a type that does not require tight grasping, pinching, or  
twisting of the wrist for operational purposes. Individuals with limited hand dexterity must be  
able to operate the unlatching or unlocking device without any special effort.  
1010.2.3 Hardware height. The proper height of the operating hardware on an egress door is  
critical to ensure that the door user can easily reach and operate the unlatching or opening device.  
Therefore, operating devices such as handles, pulls, latches, and locks are to be installed at no  
less than 34 inches \(864 mm\) and no more than 48 inches \(1,219 mm\) above the finished floor.  
These limitations are not to be imposed on locks installed strictly for security reasons. An  
example might be a locking device installed on the bottom rail of an entrance/egress door of a  
convenience store or similar retail tenant.  
1010.2.4 Locks and latches. In regard to locking and latching door hardware, the IBC allows 10  
significant exceptions to the general provision. In allowing these exceptions, it permits certain  
locking conditions that would appear to conflict with the basic requirement. However, in  
allowing these exceptions, the code often imposes certain compensating safeguards when the exit  
doors are to be locked or are provided with noncomplying hardware. It is the intent of the code  
that if the conditions are satisfied that a balance is struck between security or protecting  
occupants and the need for egress. These exceptions then essentially afford an equivalent level of  
safety as would be provided if the door were, in fact, readily openable at all times without the use  
of a key or any special knowledge or special effort.  
1\. This exception for locking hardware primarily concerns Group I-3 occupancies such as  
prisons, jails, correctional facilities, reformatories, and similar uses, where individuals are  
restrained or secured. By their nature, it is necessary that the occupants in these facilities  
be limited in their movement. Therefore, the IBC allows alternative locks or safety  
devices when it is necessary to forcibly restrain the personal liberties of the inmates or  
patients.  
Where a portion of a building is used for the restraint or security of five or fewer  
individuals, it is not considered a Group I-3 occupancy. Rather, it is anticipated that the  
secured area would simply be classified the same as the occupancy to which it is  
accessory. For example, up to five individuals could be restricted in an area such as a  
merchandise viewing room for customers in a jewelry store. In such situations, the  
allowance provided by Item 1 would be applicable for the egress door from the viewing  
room. A lock or latch that would prevent the expected unlocking or unlatching operation  
of the egress door would be acceptable. Thus, it is not necessary that the room or space be  
classified as a Group I-3 occupancy in order to apply this provision.  
2\. This exception addresses how manual locking systems can be used in assisted living,  
hospitals, and nursing facilities and still safely address the clinical needs and concerns of  
security and dementia wandering issues for the care recipients. This is conceptually  
similar to the provisions for electric locking systems of Section 1010.2.14 and used in  
similar circumstances. It is important to notice that "all" clinical staff must have the keys  
or codes to unlock the doors at all times.  
3\. The provisions of this exception apply to the main door or doors in Group A \(having an  
occupant load of 300 or less\), B, F, M, and S occupancies, and in all places of religious  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation4\. 5. 6. 7. worship. It permits the main entrance/exit doors of buildings and spaces in buildings to be  
equipped with a key-operated locking device if several conditions are satisfied. In the  
occupancies listed, it is reasonable to assume that if the building or space is occupied, the  
main entrance/exit will, in all probability, be unlocked. The first condition states that the  
locking device be readily distinguishable as locked. The use of an indicator integral to the  
locking device may assist in determining when an unsafe condition is present. A second  
condition requires that there be a sign that is readily visible, permanently maintained, and  
located on or adjacent to the door. This sign is required to read THIS DOOR TO  
REMAIN UNLOCKED WHEN THIS SPACE IS OCCUPIED. The letters must be at  
least 1 inch \(25 mm\) in height and placed on a contrasting background. Both of these  
requirements are for legibility. Although the language of the sign appears to apply without  
exception, there will be obvious situations where it should not be taken literally. For  
example, where an employee is working after hours and may be the lone occupant in the  
building or space, it is not the intent that the main doors remain in an unlocked position.  
Obviously, the sign or the presence of the sign is not going to ensure that the door is  
unlocked. However, it does advise the occupant that whenever the space is occupied, the  
law does require, in the interest of reasonable fire safety, that the door be unlocked. In the  
event the door is not unlocked, the occupant is advised that his or her life may be at risk.  
The occupant should seek to alleviate that situation. The limitation imposed by this  
provision is typically applied only when the public is involved. For example, it is not  
reasonable to assume that the subject door be unlocked during a time period the  
occupancy is limited to a janitor or other personnel. Note that the use of this exception  
may be revoked by the building official for due cause.  
Where egress doors are used in pairs, it is anticipated that each leaf in the pair of doors  
should be provided with its own operating hardware. This exception permits a special  
arrangement, however, when the pair of doors is equipped with automatic flush bolts that  
are designed so that the act of releasing one of the leaves of the pair releases both leaves.  
It is critical that the door leaf be provided with the automatic flush bolts and has no door  
handle or other surface-mounted hardware. To ensure the immediate and reliable  
operation of the pair of doors, the unlatching of either leaf in the pair must be  
accomplished by not more than one operation.  
The fifth exception refers to exit doors from individual dwelling or sleeping units of  
Group R occupancies. The general requirement of Section 1010.2.1 essentially prohibits  
the use of dead bolts or other security devices that would be installed in addition to the  
complying door hardware, as such an arrangement would require multiple operations to  
unlatch the door. This exception does permit, however, the use of a dead bolt, a security  
chain, or a night latch when the occupant load is 10 or less, on the condition that the  
device be openable from the inside without the use of a key or any special tool. It follows  
from the basic requirement of this section, however, that the device must not require any  
undue effort in order to unlatch the door and gain egress.  
The listed test procedures for a fire door include the disabling of the door operation  
mechanism. This exception clarifies that once the minimum elevated temperature has  
disabled the door’s unlatching mechanism, the resulting prevention of the door’s  
operation is acceptable.  
This exception is a simple issue of security and would be similar to allowing a lock on the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation8\. building’s entry door so that people may not enter the building through this door. If the  
roof is intended to be occupied, then access to the means of egress is required.  
Exceptions 8, 9, and 10 address various situations where occupied exterior spaces must  
egress back through the building. These exceptions attempt to strike a balance between  
security and life safety. As a general concept, the code requires an egress path to always  
be available and under the control of the user. The code also requires, per Section 1010.2,  
that the egress doors are “readily openable from the egress side without the use of a key or  
special knowledge or effort.  
” Where an occupied exterior space must pass back into and  
through the building, this essentially means the building must be left unlocked to allow  
entry into the building. These three exceptions provide guidance on where and how exit  
doors serving the exterior spaces may be locked in order to secure the building when the  
exterior space is unoccupied or of limited size.  
1010.2.5 Bolt locks. This section specifically prohibits the use of manually operated flush bolts  
or surface bolts insofar as these clearly do not conform with the intent of Section 1010.2. The use  
of such latching and/or locking hardware on means of egress doors is typically prohibited due to  
the inability of users to quickly identify and operate such devices under emergency conditions.  
Exception 1 permits the use of these types of locking devices on doors in individual dwelling  
units and sleeping units, provided the doors are not required for egress purposes. The second  
exception recognizes that in certain instances, doorway widths are dictated by the need to pass  
equipment through the openings. As a consequence, doorways, such as those to a storage room  
or equipment room, are frequently larger than would be required for exiting purposes alone.  
Therefore, where that is the case for a normally unoccupied space, manually operated bolts may  
be used on the inactive leaf. As the space is not normally occupied, this exception presents no  
significant hazard to life safety. The other side of this coin, however, is that any door leaf that is  
part of the required egress width must comply with all the requirements that apply to exit doors.  
Pairs of doors are often desired in commercial occupancies to allow for the movement of  
furnishings, equipment, and machinery. Automatic flush bolts and removable center posts can be  
easily damaged and difficult to maintain in areas of frequent door usage. Exceptions 3 and 4,  
applicable to Group B, F, and S occupancies, address building functionality while maintaining a  
high degree of occupant safety. In these moderate-hazard occupancies, the occupants are  
typically very familiar with the building and the means of egress system. It is expected that they  
are aware of the operational limits of the inactive door leaf and efficiently use the active leaf. In  
both exceptions, it is mandated that the inactive leaf not be provided with any hardware, such as  
levers or panic devices that might cause the user to assume the door is an active egress door. The  
presence of door hardware on the active leaf will provide the necessary expectation to the  
building occupants, as occupants will naturally approach the active leaf having the appropriate  
hardware. If the building is sprinklered throughout with an NFPA 13 system, there is no limit on  
occupant load assigned to the pair of egress doors other than that based on the required capacity  
of the active leaf. The inactive leaf cannot be assumed to provide for any required egress  
capacity. This ensures that the occupants have a fully complying door available for means of  
egress purposes. Remember that this section only applies to “manually operated” devices. If  
automatic flush bolts are used in accordance with item 4 in Section 1010.2.4, then the width of  
both leafs can be used to determine the egress capacity. The mandate that the building be fully  
sprinklered further enhances occupant safety and provides recognition from a general perspective  
of the value of a fire suppression system. An allowance is also provided for pairs of doors that  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationserve relatively small numbers of people in the occupancies identified. The limit of 49 occupants  
is consistent with various other means of egress requirements that allow for a reduced level of  
protection where the occupant load does not exceed 50; and the active leaf would provide  
adequate egress capacity. Under this exception, the building is not required to be sprinklered. An  
overview of the provisions is shown in Figure 1010-13.  
Figure 1010-13 Door hardware on a pair of doors.  
A fifth exception addresses those patient room doors in Group I-2 occupancies where  
additional clear width is needed to allow for the efficient movement of patients and equipment.  
Where a pair of doors is used to provide the increased opening size, self-latching edge- or  
surface-mounted bolts may be installed on the inactive leaf. In order to distinguish that the  
inactive leaf is not an egress door, no lever device or other type of operating hardware is  
permitted. In addition, the inactive leaf cannot account for any of the minimum required egress  
width of 41½ inches \(1,054 mm\).  
1010.2.7 Stairway doors. The general requirement for interior stairway doors is that they be  
openable from both sides without the use of a key or special knowledge or effort. Such  
conditions allow for immediate access from the stairway enclosure to the adjacent floor area for  
emergency responders. In addition, in the unlikely event that the stairwell becomes untenable  
during evacuation procedures, occupants may reenter a floor level as an alternative means of  
egress. However, five exceptions are provided to modify this requirement.  
1\. Those doors that provide egress from the stair enclosure, discharging directly to the  
exterior or to an egress component leading to the exterior, are permitted to be locked only  
on the side opposite the direction of egress travel.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. 3. 4. 5. In high-rise buildings, stairway doors, other than exit discharge doors, may be locked  
from the stairway side. Under these conditions, such doors must be capable of being  
unlocked simultaneously without unlatching upon a signal from the fire command center.  
Although this exception is not limited to use in high-rise buildings, it is most commonly  
applied in such situations. When used in buildings that are not considered high-rise, the  
criteria of Section 403.5.3 may also be applied.  
Doors are permitted to be locked from the side opposite the egress side for stairways  
where emergency personnel have the ability to simultaneously unlock the door. This  
action must be accomplished upon a signal from a single interior location at the building’s  
main entrance, with the specific location for the actuating device likely approved by the  
fire code official. Where the building is provided with a fire command center, the signal  
must be actuated from within the center. It is important that the unlocking signal not  
deactivate the latching devices of the stairway doors. The doors must remain latched in  
order to maintain their integrity as fire door assemblies.  
Applicable only to two-story buildings housing a Group B, F, M, or S occupancy, this  
exception permits the locking of the stairway door from the stairway side provided the  
only interior access to the tenant space is a single exit stair. Under specified conditions in  
Section 1006.3.4, a single exit is permitted from the basement or second story of the  
moderate-hazard occupancies scoped in this exception. Where a single exit stair is  
acceptable due to a limited occupant load and travel distance, it is permissible to lock the  
door to the tenant space from the stairway side.  
This exception is similar in application to Exception 4.  
1010.2.8 Locking arrangements in educational occupancies. This section is intended to  
provide a balance between needed egress availability and security which may be needed to keep  
intruders in threatening situations from being able to open the door. These provisions may be  
applied in any educational use whether classified as a Group E, B, or I-4 occupancy. In addition,  
the provisions are not limited only to the classrooms but can include any other associated  
occupied rooms or office areas.  
1010.2.9 Panic and fire exit hardware. Basically, panic hardware is an unlatching device that  
will operate even during panic situations, so that the weight of the crowd against the door will  
cause the device to unlatch. This provision of the code, in harmony with the need to swing the  
door in the direction of egress travel, is intended to prevent the type of disaster experienced in  
the Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston in 1942. When a panic hardware device is installed on a  
swinging door leaf, the press of the crowd, which prevented the opening of the door in the  
Cocoanut Grove fire, will ensure the automatic opening of the door.  
Where panic hardware is provided, it is necessary that the activating member of the device  
extend for at least one-half of the width of the door leaf. This minimum length ensures that the  
unlatching operation will take place when one or more individuals impact the door. In addition,  
the device must be arranged so that a horizontal force not exceeding 15 pounds \(66 N\), when  
applied in the direction of exit travel, will unlatch the door.  
Where required. Because of the large concentration of people in an assembly occupancy that  
may reach an exit door at about the same time during an emergency, the Group A occupancy is  
one of those occupancy groups that requires the installation of panic hardware listed in  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationaccordance with UL 305. Such hardware is also required in Group E occupancies for essentially  
the same reason. Therefore, in these two occupancies, any swinging egress door provided with a  
latching or locking device that serves a room or area having an occupant load of 50 or more must  
be provided with panic hardware. In addition, in all Group H occupancies, panic hardware is  
required on every egress door regardless of the occupant load served. The potential life-safety  
hazard in these Group H occupancies is such that when it is necessary to evacuate this type of  
use, exiting from such spaces must be almost immediate. To facilitate the rapid escape from  
these occupancies, egress doors shall not be provided with a latch or lock unless it is panic  
hardware. Again, it should be noted that if a door is used in a situation where panic hardware  
might otherwise be required, it is not necessary to install panic hardware if the door has no  
means for locking or latching. If the door is free to swing at all times, there is no need to install  
panic hardware to overcome a lock or latch. Panic hardware is also not mandated on those doors  
considered as the main exit in a Group A occupancy having an occupant load of 300 or less  
where the provisions of Section 1010.2.4, Item 3, are applied, permitting the use of key-operated  
locking devices. Electrically locked doors complying with Section 1010.2.11 or 1010.2.12 are  
also permitted in lieu of panic hardware. To coordinate with provisions in other sections,  
exceptions 3 and 4 allow locking devices on egress doors from exterior spaces that reenter the  
building and those that serve as the secondary route from courtrooms provided the appropriate  
limitations are followed. Subsections 1010.2.9.1 and 1010.2.9.2 address the need to immediately  
escape the hazards found within refrigeration machinery rooms and electrical rooms containing  
certain types of equipment or exceeding certain ratings.  
Panic hardware on balanced doors. Special care must be taken when installing panic  
hardware on balanced doors. In this instance, push-pad-type panic hardware is to be used, and it  
must be installed at one-half of the door width nearest the latch side to avoid locating the pad too  
close to the pivot point.  
Section 1010.1.2 requires that exit doors should be side-hinged or pivoted swinging doors.  
The typical pivoted door has its top and bottom pivot points located near the edge of the door  
frame opposite the latch side. Balanced doors are nothing more than a specialized type of pivoted  
door in which the pivot point is located some distance inboard from the door edge, creating a  
counter-balancing effect. The length of the panic bar is limited for balanced doors because the  
door cannot be opened if the opening force is applied too close to the pivot point or beyond.  
Limiting the panic bar length to one-half the door width ensures that those who use the door will  
apply opening pressure at a distance sufficiently removed from the pivot point to allow the door  
to open. See Figure 1010-14.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1010-14 Panic hardware on balanced doors.  
1010.2.10 Monitored or recorded egress. Monitored egress is where a device requiring  
credentials such as a card reader, keypad, or biometrics is used to monitor who is egressing. This  
section permits these types of systems provided they are incorporated with one of the special  
locking arrangements listed, or that the door is still capable of being opened without activating  
the device.  
1010.2.11 Door hardware release of electrically locked egress doors. As a general rule, means  
of egress door hardware must be operable by manual operation to provide for occupant control of  
the egress system. Locking devices are typically prohibited, as they can interfere or prevent  
efficient egress through the door during an emergency situation. However, owner concerns that  
must be considered sometimes require a greater degree of security. In specific occupancies, doors  
in the means of egress are permitted to be electrically locked if equipped with listed hardware  
that incorporates a built-in switch that interrupts the power supply to the electric lock and  
unlocks the door. The use of this type of locking system provides for a greater degree of security  
than that offered by other methods addressed in the code, including delayed egress locking  
systems and sensor released electrically locked egress systems.  
In other than Group H, the allowance for electronically locked egress doors is permitted in all  
occupancies where security can be a major concern. The listed hardware that incorporates a built-  
in switch is required to comply with UL 294. When the occupant prepares to use the door  
hardware, the method of operating the hardware must be obvious, even under poor lighting  
conditions. The operation shall be accomplished through the use of a single hand. This is  
consistent with the general requirement that the door be readily openable without the use of  
special knowledge or effort. The unlocking of the door must occur immediately on the operation  
of the hardware by interrupting the power supply to the electronic lock. As an additional  
safeguard, the loss of power to the hardware shall automatically unlock the door.  
This special type of locking device is permitted to be used in conjunction with panic hardware  
and fire exit hardware, but only where operation of such hardware also releases the  
electromagnetic lock.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1010.2.12 Sensor release of electrically locked egress doors. Security concerns have prompted  
the use of electrically locked doors to provide controlled access at entrance doors to buildings or  
tenant spaces. Therefore, this section permits the use of an approved electrically locked egress  
door at the main entrance of all occupancies except Group H. Sensor-released egress doors will  
typically be locked from the exterior at all times. In order to ensure that the door is fully operable  
during a fire incident or other emergency, a number of criteria have been developed. For the  
most part, when a problem situation is identified, the door operates in a manner like any other  
egress door. Activation of the building fire alarm, automatic sprinkler system, or fire detection  
system will automatically unlock the door. Unlocking must also be possible from a location  
adjacent to the door, or occur when there is loss of power to the access-control system. It is  
important to note that emergency lighting must be provided on the egress side of the door and  
that the security device must be listed in accordance with UL 294, Access Control System Units.  
1010.2.13 Delayed egress. The building code provides for a degree of security to egress doors  
serving Groups B, F, I, M, R, S, and U occupancies, as well as for limited situations for Group E  
classrooms and Group A-3 or B courtrooms. This section allows the use of a door that has an  
egress-control device with a built-in time delay under specific conditions. These devices were  
introduced in the code to resolve the problem of an exit door being illegally blocked by building  
operators desperate to stop the theft of merchandise through unsupervised, secondary exits.  
Institutional and residential occupancies are included because it is perceived that they also have  
security problems that need to be addressed. The devices are sometimes needed in nursing homes  
or group-care where facility operators must restrict patient egress while still maintaining viable  
exit systems.  
It must be emphasized that under the conditions imposed by this section, and within the  
reliability of the automatic systems required, there will often be no delay whatsoever at the exit  
in an actual fire emergency—the door will be immediately openable.  
Delayed egress locking conditions. Several conditions should be emphasized at the outset\:  
1\. Such devices may be used only in connection with the specifically listed occupancies.  
2\. The entire building in which the delayed egress locking system is installed must be  
completely protected throughout by either an approved automatic sprinkler system or an  
approved automatic smoke- or heat-detection system.  
3\. In other than Groups I-1 Condition 2, I-2 and I-3 occupancies, a building occupant shall  
not be required to pass through more than one door equipped with a delayed egress lock  
before entering an exit. Groups I-1 Condition 1 and I-4 are also granted this two door/30  
second option, but only with specific increased sprinkler requirements.  
4\. The door shall unlock in compliance with the following criteria\: The device must  
immediately and automatically deactivate on activation of the sprinkler system or fire-  
detection system, and on the loss of electrical power to the egress lock. There must also be  
a way of manually deactivating the device by the operation of a signal from the fire  
command center where provided. Where the operating device is activated, it must initiate  
an irreversible process that will cause the delayed egress lock to deactivate whenever a  
manual force of not more than 15 pounds \(66 N\) is applied for a minimum period of 3  
seconds to the operating hardware. The irreversible process must achieve the deactivation  
of the device within a time period of not more than 15 seconds from the time the  
operating hardware is originally activated. Where approved by the building official, a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdelay of not more than 30 seconds is permitted. Upon activation of the operating  
hardware, an audible signal shall be initiated at the door so that the person attempting to  
exit the building will be aware that the irreversible process has been started.  
A sign must be installed on the door above and within 12 inches \(305 mm\) of the operating  
hardware so that the person seeking egress can be informed as to the type and nature of the  
egress lock. The sign must read PUSH \(PULL\) UNTIL ALARM SOUNDS. DOOR CAN BE  
OPENED IN 15 \(30\) SECONDS. An additional requirement requires emergency lighting to be  
provided at the door where the delayed egress lock is used. In all cases, the delayed egress  
locking system must comply with UL 294.  
Delayed egress lock reactivation. The code emphasizes that, regardless of the means of  
deactivation, relocking of the device shall only be by manual means at the door. This  
requirement ensures that to relock the delayed egress lock, someone must go to the door itself,  
verify that the emergency no longer exists, and only then relock the door by manual means.  
1010.2.14 Controlled egress doors in Groups I-1 and I-2. Group I-1 and I-2 facilities often  
house dementia and Alzheimer’s patients. In order to balance the needs of the facility with the  
life safety of the occupants, the limitations on locking devices in these types of uses must allow  
for a safe and secure environment for these patients within the means of egress concepts of the  
code. Locks are permitted on means of egress doors that serve Group I-1 and I-2 care recipients  
whose movement is restrained provided a number of conditions are met. Many of the conditions  
are similar to those set forth in Section 1010.2.13 for delayed egress locks. The building must be  
fully sprinklered or provided with an approved smoke detection system. The doors must unlock  
upon actuation of the sprinkler or smoke-detection system, the loss of power to the lock or lock  
mechanism, or by a signal from the nursing station or other approved location. The staff must  
also have the means to unlock the doors when necessary. As a further condition, it is mandated  
that occupants need only pass through one door equipped with this special egress device prior to  
entering an exit element. In all cases, the door locking system must be in conformance with UL  
294.  
Where patients with mental disabilities are housed, it is often necessary that they be restrained  
or contained for their own safety. In such cases, the level of restraint must be maintained even if  
the fire protection systems are activated or the power to the lock fails. However, it is still  
important that the emergency preparedness plan be developed and the clinical staff has the ability  
to monitor and enable the evacuation. See Figure 1010-15. The provisions are also applicable  
where the locking system is used in nursery and obstetric areas of Group I-2 hospitals to reduce  
the risk of child abduction.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1010-15 Locks on egress doors of Group I-1 and I-2 occupancies.  
1010.3 Special doors. Based on the provisions in Section 1010.1.2, the code generally requires  
that doors in exiting systems be of the side-hinged swinging, pivoted or balanced door type. In  
this section, four different types of doors are identified that may be used under very specific  
conditions.  
1010.3.1 Revolving doors. Revolving doors continue to be used at building entrances. Where  
once used primarily in cold climates, they are now being installed in all regions, primarily as an  
energy-conservation measure. The use of revolving doors is specifically permitted as an  
alternative to enclosed vestibules where such vestibules are required by the International Energy  
Conservation Code® \(IECC®\) at the entrances to commercial buildings. Exception 5 of Section  
1010.1.2 permits the installation and use of revolving doors in all occupancies other than Group  
H when complying with this section. However, it is not permissible to use revolving doors to  
supply more than 50 percent of the required egress capacity, nor be assigned a capacity greater  
than 50 persons. Where used, the door must be an approved revolving door and comply with the  
specific requirements listed.  
All revolving doors must be in full compliance with BHMA A156.27. When revolving doors  
are installed, they must be of a type where the door leaves will breakout under opposing  
pressures providing at least 36 inches \(914 mm\) of aggregate width. Location of the door in  
relationship to the foot or top of stairs or escalators is regulated, as is the maximum number of  
revolutions per minute. At least one conforming exit door shall be located in close proximity to  
the revolving door. In such an arrangement, the adjacent swinging door can be used to satisfy  
exit capacity requirements. The maximum force levels required to collapse a revolving door vary  
based on whether or not the door is to be used as an egress component.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1010.3.2 Power-operated doors. Power-operated sliding or swinging doors are often used at the  
main entry of a building, particularly in mercantile and business occupancies. The same doors  
are also typically an important aspect in the overall exiting system for the building. There are a  
number of different types of doors that use a power source to open a door or assist in the manual  
operation of the door. This may include doors with a photoelectric-actuated mechanism to open  
the door upon the approach of a person, or doors with power-assisted manual operation. Where  
such doors are used as a portion of the means of egress, they must be installed in accordance  
with this section. The main criterion concerns the capability of the door being opened manually  
in the event of a power failure. Essentially, doors shall have the capability of swinging, and they  
must be designed and installed to break away from any position in the opening and swing to the  
fully open position when an opening force not exceeding 50 pounds \(222 N\) is applied at the  
normal push-plate location. Power-operated swinging, sliding, and folding doors must comply  
with BHMA A156.10, whereas BHMA A156.19 applies to swinging doors that are power-  
assisted and low-energy power-operated. Sliding or folding doors that are low-energy power-  
operated are regulated by BHMA A156.38.  
1010.3.3 Special purpose horizontal sliding, accordion, or folding doors. Used as smoke  
and/or fire separation elements, these doors are normally in a fully open position and hidden  
from view. Closing only under specific conditions, they typically are part of an elevator lobby or  
similar protected area. Eight provisions are identified in the IBC that regulate the use of such  
doors as a component of means of egress. Fundamental to the use of these special doors is that  
manual operation of the normally power-operated doors must be possible in the event of a power  
failure, and no special or complex effort or knowledge should be necessary to open the doors  
from the egress side.  
1010.3.4 Security grilles. Because of the concern of exit doors being obstructed or even  
completely unusable, the use of security grilles is strictly regulated. By their nature, security  
grilles are difficult to operate under emergency conditions. Used frequently at the main entrances  
to retail sales tenants in a covered mall building, such grilles are also permitted in other Group M  
occupancies as well as Groups B, F, and S. Security grilles, either horizontal sliding or vertical,  
are only permitted at the main entrance/exit. During periods of time when the space is occupied,  
including those times where occupied by employees only, the grilles must be openable from the  
inside without the use of a key or special knowledge. They must be secured in the fully open  
position during those times where the space is occupied by the general public. Where two or  
more exits or access to exits are required from the space, a maximum of 50 percent of the exits or  
exit access doorways are to be equipped with security grilles.  
1010.4 Gates. This section serves as a reminder that gates within the means of egress system  
must comply with all of the requirements for doors. The single exception, is applicable only to  
fences and walls surrounding stadiums.  
1010.4.1 Stadiums. Facilities such as stadiums may be enclosed by fencing or similar  
enclosures. The requirement for panic hardware does not apply to gates through such enclosures,  
provided that the gates are under constant and immediate supervision while the stadium is  
occupied. However, there must be a safe dispersal area of a size sufficient to accommodate the  
occupant load of the stadium based on 3 square feet \(0.28 m2\) per person, and located between  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe stadium and the fence or other enclosure. Such a dispersal area must not be less than 50 feet  
\(15,240 mm\) from the stadium it serves.  
1010.5 Turnstiles and similar devices. In order to address safety concerns that are due to the  
use of turnstiles or similar devices that may be placed along the path of exit travel, this section  
regulates their use when located in a manner to restrict travel to a single direction. The general  
rule requires that each turnstile be credited with a maximum capacity of 50 occupants, and then  
only when specific conditions are met. When primary power is lost, the device shall turn freely  
in the direction of egress travel. Release shall also occur upon manual operation by an employee  
in the area. When determining the overall egress capacity, turnstiles may only be considered for  
up to 50 percent of the required capacity. Each device is limited to 39 inches \(991 mm\) in height  
and must have a minimum clear width of 16½ inches \(419 mm\) at and below the height of 39  
inches \(991 mm\). Above the 39-inch \(991-mm\) height, a clear minimum width of 22 inches \(559  
mm\) is necessary. Obviously, variations in these requirements are necessary where the turnstile  
is located along an accessible route of travel. Where turnstiles exceed 39 inches \(991 mm\) in  
height, they are regulated in a manner consistent with revolving doors.  
To address the concern for use of such devices in large occupancies, Section 1010.5.4 requires  
a side-hinged swinging door for devices other than portable turnstiles. Required at a point where  
the occupant load served exceeds 300, a swinging door must be located within 50 feet \(15,240  
mm\) of each turnstile. Portable turnstiles are designed to be moved out of the way for large  
occupancies such as sporting events.  
While the previously discussed requirements apply to what may be considered as traditional  
turnstiles, Section 1010.5.2 deals with a newer style of control device that is generally viewed as  
providing security access. Where these devices inhibit egress travel they must comply with this  
section. These barriers have not only different size and capacity requirements, but they can only  
be used in fully sprinklered buildings and must be set up to automatically open during a number  
of circumstances.  
Section 1011 Stairways  
In order to apply the requirements of this section on stairways in an appropriate manner, the  
scope of the provisions must be determined. The definition of a stairway is critical for this  
determination. Found in Section 202, the definition consists of two parts. First, a stair is  
considered a change of elevation accomplished by one or more risers. Second, one or more  
flights of such stairs make up a stairway, along with any landings and platforms that connect to  
them. Based on these two definitions, a single step would also be considered a stairway under the  
IBC.  
1011.1 General. The scoping provision for this section indicates that the requirements of Section  
1011 apply to any stairway serving an occupied portion of a building, eliminating the potential  
for inappropriate interpretations that view stairways not required as a means of egress as not  
regulated by Chapter 10 nor the provisions of Section 1011. Whether stairways are serving as a  
required portion of the egress system or simply installed in additional numbers beyond the code  
minimum, as “convenience” stairs, it is appropriate for all stairways to meet the minimum  
safeguards that the code intends.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1011.2 Width and capacity. The provisions concerning minimum width and required capacity  
of stairways are analogous to the provisions relating to corridors discussed in Section 1020.3. If  
the stair is subject to use by a sufficiently large occupant load, the minimum required width of  
the stair is determined by using the formula stated in Section 1005.3.1. Otherwise, its required  
width cannot be less than the width established by this section. In general terms, the minimum  
required width of any stair must be at least 44 inches \(1,118 mm\). In the event the stairway  
serves an occupant load of 49 or less, the required minimum width of the stairway is only 36  
inches \(914 mm\). The entire occupant load of the story served by the stairway is considered,  
rather than divided by all available stairways. See Application Example 1011-1. Other  
modifications to the width requirements apply to spiral stairways as addressed in Section  
1011.10, and stairways that are provided with an incline platform lift or stairway chairlift.  
Generally, when the code specifies a required width of a component in the egress system, it  
intends that width to be the clear, net, usable unobstructed width. However, handrails and other  
projections are permitted to encroach into the required capacity or minimum width of a stairway  
as established by the provisions of Section 1014.8. It should be noted that “stepped aisles” in  
assembly spaces must comply with the requirements of Section 1030 and not the general  
stairway provisions. There are a number of differences such as width, capacity, riser heights,  
landings, and other items that make this distinction important as to why the specific requirements  
from Section 1030 should be applied.  
Application Example 1011-1  
1011.3 Headroom. A minimum headroom clearance of 6 feet 8 inches \(2,032 mm\) is required in  
connection with every stairway. Such required clearances shall be measured vertically from the  
leading edge of the treads to the lowest projection of any construction, piping, fixture, or other  
object above the stairs, and shall be maintained for the full width of the stairway and landing.  
See Figure 1011-1. This specific height requirement overrides the general means of egress  
ceiling height requirement found in Section 1003.2 and is modified for spiral stairways by  
Section 1011.10.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1011-1 Stairway headroom clearance.  
Figure 1011-2 Rise and run.  
1011.5.2 Riser height and tread depth. This section provides for a maximum riser height of 7  
inches \(178 mm\), a minimum riser of 4 inches \(102 mm\), and a minimum tread run of 11 inches  
\(279 mm\) for each step on any stairway. These limiting dimensions are identified in Figure  
1011-2\. Variations in the requirements for treads and risers apply to alternating tread devices,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationspiral stairways, and stepped aisles in assembly seating areas. These variations are discussed  
elsewhere in this chapter. Another exception allows 7¾ inches \(197 mm\) maximum and 10  
inches \(254 mm\) minimum for rise and run, respectively, for stairways in Group R-3  
occupancies, within dwelling units in Group R-2 occupancies, and in Group U occupancies  
accessory to a Group R-2 or R-3 dwelling unit.  
The 7-inch \(178-mm\) rise and 11-inch \(279-mm\) run figures for the steps are based primarily  
on safety in descending the stairs and are the result of much research. Probably at no prior time  
in the history of codes has the proportionate of stairs enjoyed a better foundation in research.  
As one descends a stairway, balance is essential for safety. Therefore, the tread run must be of  
such a dimension as to permit the user to balance comfortably on the ball of the foot. The  
appropriate combination of riser height and tread run provides the proper geometry to enable the  
user to accomplish the necessary balance to descend the stairway with reasonable safety.  
Consistent with the importance of the tread dimension, the method of measurement of the tread  
is expressly stated. Specifically, tread depth \(or run\) is that distance measured horizontally  
between vertical planes passing through the foremost projections of adjacent treads or landing.  
As such, the tread dimension is the net gain in the run of the stair. Tread dimension is measured  
in this manner because any tread surface underneath the overhang of a sloping riser or nosing on  
the tread above is not available to the person descending the stair. Because descending is the  
more critical direction, proper dimension of the tread is of paramount importance.  
Studies of people traveling on stairways have shown that probably the greatest hazard on a  
stair is the user. Inattention has been identified as the single factor producing the greatest number  
of missteps, accidents, and injuries. Inattention frequently results from the user being overly  
familiar with the stair and its surroundings. It often results from a variety of distractions. It is  
critical to stair safety that the stair user be attentive to the stair, although attentiveness cannot be  
codified or dictated. However, stair design and geometry, which usually trigger human error, can  
be controlled.  
Curved stairways, along with spiral stairways, represent somewhat of an exception to what is  
normally considered a traditional stairway. Where the typical stairway is required to have treads  
of a consistent and uniform size and shape, these two stairs may have different dimensional  
characteristics from adjacent treads and vary from one end of the tread to the other. Alternating  
tread devices and ships ladders are additional types of vertical travel components whose design is  
inconsistent with that of a typical stairway. The use of these components as a portion of the  
means of egress system varies; however, other than a straight run stairway, only curved stairways  
may be used as a part of the means of egress in all occupancies and locations.  
1011.5.4 Dimensional uniformity. A significant safety factor relative to stairways is the  
uniformity of risers and treads in any flight of stairs. The section of a stairway leading from one  
landing to the next is defined as a flight of stairs. It is very important that any variation that  
would interfere with the rhythm of the stair user be avoided. Although it is true that adequate  
attention to the use of the stair can compensate for substantial variations in risers and treads, it is  
all too frequent that the necessary attention is not given by the stair user.  
To obtain the best uniformity possible in a flight of stairs, the maximum variation between the  
highest and lowest risers and between the widest and narrowest treads is limited to ⅜ inch \(9.5  
mm\). This tolerance is not intended to be used as a design variation, but it does recognize that  
construction practices make it difficult to get exactly identical riser heights and tread dimensions  
in constructing a stairway facility in the field. Therefore, the code allows the variation indicated  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationin Figure 1011-3. Although the code allows for a tolerance in both the tread depth and riser  
height, this tolerance is not intended to permit a reduction in the minimum tread depth or  
increase in the maximum riser height established by the IBC. For example, a tread depth of 10⅝  
inches \(270 mm\) is not permitted if a minimum of 11 inches \(279 mm\) is required, nor is a riser  
height of 7⅜ inches \(188 mm\) acceptable where the code limits riser height to 7 inches \(178  
mm\).  
Under the provisions of Section 1030.14.2, riser height nonuniformity is permitted for stepped  
aisles where changes in the gradient of the adjoining assembly seating area are necessitated in  
order to maintain adequate lines of sight. Another exception permits the transition between a  
typical straight run stairway and consistently shaped winders under the conditions of Section  
1011.5.  
Figure 1011-3 Stair tolerance.  
1011.5.4.1 Nonuniform height risers. With respect to variation, it is recognized that stairs  
occasionally descend or rise to areas where the ground or the finished surface is sloping. Where  
this occurs on private property, the code anticipates that the landing of the stairs be level so that  
there will not be any variation in the riser height across the width of the stair at that point.  
However, from time to time, stairs will land on spaces that are not under the control of the  
property owner, such as a public sidewalk. Therefore, a certain degree of slope across the width  
of the stair is permitted, resulting in a variation of the height of the riser from one side of the stair  
to the other. Where this occurs, the height of such a riser may be reduced along the slope to less  
than 4 inches \(102 mm\), and the maximum permitted slope shall not exceed 1 unit vertical in 12  
units horizontal \(8.3-percent slope\). Figure 1011-4 shows this condition. It should be clarified  
that the sloping surface is intended to be an established grade, such as a walkway, public way, or  
driveway.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1011-4 Sloping landing.  
1011.5.5 Nosing and riser profile. Tread nosings are limited to a maximum radius or beveling  
of 9/16 inch \(14.3 mm\) and shall not extend more than 1¼ inches \(32 mm\) beyond the tread  
below. A minimum curvature or bevel of 1/16 inch \(1.6 mm\) is also required. Nosing projections  
are to be consistent throughout the stair flight, including where the nosing occurs at the floor at  
the top of a flight. Risers are to be solid and, if sloped, slope no more than 30 degrees \(0.52 rad\)  
from the vertical. See Figure 1011-5 for an overview of these provisions.  
There are three exceptions that exempt the requirement for solid risers. First, the risers need  
not be solid where the stairway does not need to comply with the provisions of Section 1009.3  
for a stairway used as an accessible means of egress. However, some method of construction  
must be used to limit the openings between treads to less than 4 inches \(102 mm\). Second, solid  
risers are not required in nonpublic areas of Group F, H, I-3, and S occupancies. The third  
exception indicates that solid risers are not required for complying spiral stairways.  
1011.6 Stairway landings. Landings are discussed to some extent under Section 1010.1.5,  
which covers landings that are used with adjoining doors. This section covers landings associated  
with stairs in creating a stairway. The basis for determining the required dimensions of landings  
is simple; every landing must be at least as wide as the stair it serves. It must also have a  
dimension measured in the direction of travel not less than the width of the stairway. However,  
in those instances where the stair has a straight run, the landing length need not be more than 48  
inches \(1,219 mm\) measured in the direction of travel. As a stairway changes direction at a  
landing, it is important that the actual width of the stairway be maintained throughout the travel,  
even if the actual width is greater than the required width. Where the stairway reaches capacity  
across its width during egress, a landing of reduced size will create an obstruction to the flow  
pattern that has been established. Because this condition does not occur in a straight run of stairs,  
a limitation on length is permitted. The dimensional criteria for stair landings are illustrated in  
Figure 1011-6. An exception provides that stepped aisles need only comply with Section 1030.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1011-5 Stair nosing.  
Shape of landing. It has generally been viewed that the code permits providing a complete  
curve with the radius equal to the width of the stairway, as shown in Figure 1011-7. This is  
accepted by exception 3 and recognizes that egress travel through the landing maintains the  
egress width and would not generally extend into the corners. Application of this approach  
would provide for the presence of structural columns, standpipes, and similar building  
components within the nonusable portions of the landing. Exception 2 explains how to measure  
the landing on a curved stair. This exception is somewhat of a combination between the  
requirements for a straight run stair and those of Exception 3 and is illustrated in Figure 1011-8.  
1011.7 Stairway construction. Materials used in the construction of stairways are to be  
consistent with those types of materials permitted based on the building’s type of construction. In  
other words, stairways in Type I and II buildings are to be constructed of noncombustible  
materials. In buildings classified as Type III, IV, or V construction, combustible or  
noncombustible materials may be used for stairway construction. These requirements are  
applicable to the structural elements of the stairway, including stringers and treads. Finish  
materials on stairways are regulated under the provisions of Section 804. Exception 1 permits the  
use of wood handrails in all types of construction. Exception 2 references an option within  
Section 510.2 that allows combustible stairways in the lower Type I portion of a podium  
building.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1011-6 Landing dimensions.  
Figure 1011-7 Alternative shape of landing.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1011-8 Landing depth at curved stairway.  
It is important that both ascending and descending portions of stairway flights end at  
relatively level landings, having maximum slopes of 1\:48. In addition, the treads themselves are  
limited to a slope no steeper than 1\:48 in any direction. For increased safety and ease of use, the  
treads and landings are to have a substantially solid surface. However, the use of gratings or  
similar open-type walking surfaces is permitted for use in treads and landing platforms in  
manufacturing buildings, warehouses, and hazardous occupancies. Stairways in such uses are not  
typically accessible to the public. The extent of the openings in the walking surfaces of such  
stairs and landings is limited to where a sphere with a diameter of 1⅛ inches \(29 mm\) cannot  
pass through. In all occupancies, small openings are also permitted provided they do not permit  
the passage of a ½-inch \(12.7-mm\) sphere. Where the opening is elongated, the long dimension  
must be placed perpendicular to the direction of stairway travel.  
Because of the hazards associated with accumulated water on exterior stairways, outdoor  
stairs and outdoor approaches to such stairs are to be designed in a manner so that water will not  
stand on the walking surfaces.  
To protect the integrity of this very important element of the exit system, any enclosed usable  
space under either an unenclosed or enclosed stairway shall be protected by fire-resistance-rated  
construction. For this requirement to be applicable, both conditions must exist\: the space under  
the stairway must be enclosed, and it also must be accessible, such as by a door or access panel.  
The level of protection of the walls and soffits within the enclosed space shall be equivalent to  
the fire-resistance rating of the stairway enclosure, but in no case less than 1 hour. In order to  
better ensure the integrity of the enclosure, access to the usable space cannot occur from within  
the stair enclosure. Within an individual dwelling unit in Group R-2 or R-3, the mandated fire-  
resistance-rated construction is not required; however, a minimum of ½-inch \(12.7-mm\) gypsum  
board protection must be provided.  
Much like interior stairways, enclosed usable space under exterior egress stairways must be  
protected by fire-resistance-rated construction. The minimum level of fire resistance is 1 hour,  
regardless of the number of stories the exterior stairway serves. Where there is open space below  
exterior stairways, such space is not to be used for any purpose.  
1011.8 Vertical rise. Negotiating stairs can sometimes become difficult, particularly for persons  
not accustomed to using stairs, or for the elderly or disabled. The code limits the maximum  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationvertical rise between landings serving stairs to 12 feet \(3,658 mm\) so that this difficulty does not  
become excessive. Aside from the physical exertion necessary, stairs of exceptional height can  
be intimidating. It is necessary at vertical intervals not exceeding 12 feet \(3,658 mm\) to provide  
for places in the stairway where the user can rest. The limitation of 12 feet \(3,658 mm\) does not  
apply to spiral stairways serving as egress from technical production areas. Up to 20 feet \(6,096  
mm\) of vertical rise between landings is permitted for alternating tread devices when such  
devices are used as a means of egress.  
The 12-foot \(3,658-mm\) dimension is not unreasonable. In most instances, it will more than  
accommodate a single-story height so that in most buildings a single flight of stairs could be  
used, if desired, to negotiate travel from one floor to the next adjacent floor.  
Even though a single flight of stairs is permitted by the code, stairs having an intermediate  
landing between floors are used in the majority of buildings.  
1011.9 Curved stairways. Curved stairs are one of the special types of stairways that the code  
allows as an alternative to the typical straight stair. Figure 1011-9 depicts this type of alternative  
stair. It is essentially circular in configuration. The basic requirement is that the inside, or least,  
radius should be at least twice the minimum width or required capacity of the stair. This rule  
ensures a certain limited degree of curvature deemed acceptable in circular stairs. The only other  
criterion specified for circular stairs is that treads comply with the winder tread provisions of  
Section 1011.5. In designing the curved stair and relating the inside radius to the width of the  
stair, it is important that only the required width or capacity of the stair need be used. Because of  
the stair’s geometry, this is a fairly comfortable stairway to use. The geometry of the curved  
stairway for Group R-3 occupancies and within dwelling units of Group R-2 would only be  
regulated by the winder tread provisions of Section 1011.5.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1011-9 Curved stairways.  
1011.10 Spiral stairways. Spiral stairways are a special type of stair that the code permits in  
limited applications. As a means of egress component, spiral stairways may be used within  
dwelling units, or from spaces having an occupant load of five or less and not exceeding 250  
square feet \(23 m2\) in area. Spiral stairways are also permitted as egress elements from galleries,  
catwalks, gridirons, and other technical production areas.  
A spiral stairway is one where the treads radiate from a central pole. Such a stair must provide  
a clear width of at least 26 inches \(660 mm\) at and below the handrail. Each tread must have a  
minimum dimension of 6¾ inches \(171 mm\) at a point 12 inches \(305 mm\) from its narrow end.  
This tread depth is to be measured in a straight line at the walkline as opposed to being measured  
perpendicular to the face of the tread. The stair must have at least 6 feet 6 inches \(1,981 mm\) of  
headroom measured vertically from the leading edge of the tread. The rise between treads can be  
as much as, but not more than, 9½ inches \(241 mm\). The required dimensions of a spiral  
stairway are depicted in Figure 1011-10.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1011-10 Spiral stairways.  
1011.11 Handrails. Probably the most important safety device that can be provided in  
connection with stairways is the handrail. It will never be known how many missteps, accidents,  
injuries, or even fatalities have been prevented by a properly installed, sturdy handrail. Basically,  
a handrail should be within relatively easy reach of every stair user. In general, all stairways are  
required to have handrails on each side. However, the code has the following specific conditions  
allowing the use of only one handrail\:  
1\. On stairways within dwelling units  
2\. On spiral stairways  
Handrails may be omitted under four conditions. Where a single change in elevation occurs at  
a deck, patio, or walkway, handrails are not required, provided a complying landing area is  
present. In Group R-3 occupancies, handrails are not required at a single riser serving an  
entrance door or egress door. In individual dwelling units and sleeping units of Group R-2 and  
R-3 occupancies, it is also permissible to provide a change in room elevation of three or fewer  
risers and not install a handrail. The last exemption is a unique situation where a platform lift is  
serving as the landing and some type of handhold or gripping surface is provided, such as a wall  
around the platform lift.  
1011.12 Stairway to roof. To provide for easy access to roof surfaces and to facilitate fire-  
fighting in buildings four or more stories in height, at least one stairway is required to extend to  
the roof unless the roof is considered unoccupied. However, even where the roof is considered  
unoccupied, access by way of a stairway must be provided where the roof and penthouse contain  
elevator equipment that must be accessed for maintenance. Where a stairway is not required,  
access may be achieved through the use of an alternating tread device, a ships ladder, or a  
permanent ladder. Access is not a requirement on steeper roofs where the slope exceeds 4 units  
vertical in 12 units horizontal \(33-percent slope\).  
1011.13 Guards. Roof hatches are permitted as a means of access to unoccupied roofs where  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsuch access is required in buildings four or more stories in height. In addition, roof-hatch  
openings are often provided in low-rise buildings for varied purposes, including access to rooftop  
equipment. This provision addresses the hazard created where the roof hatch is located very  
close to the roof edge. See Figure 1011-11. It is necessary that persons accessing the roof by a  
roof hatch be protected from falling off the roof as a result of a trip or misstep. Occasionally,  
these roof accesses are used during inclement weather, emergency situations, or times of  
darkness. It is during these conditions when the hazard level is even higher.  
Figure 1011-11 Protection at roof-hatch openings.  
1011.14 Alternating tread devices. An alternating tread device is a unique type of stairway that  
also has some characteristics of a ladder. Because it is considered difficult to use for egress  
purposes, an alternating tread device may only be used as a means of egress in a limited number  
of occupancies. In factories, warehouses, and high-hazard occupancies, this device can only be  
used for egress from a small mezzanine serving a limited number of occupants. In Group I-3  
occupancies, an alternating tread device may be the egress path from a small guard tower or  
observation area. An alternating tread device can also be used for access and egress from an  
unoccupied roof. See Figure 1011-12.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1011-12 Alternating tread device.  
Alternating tread devices must have complying handrails on both sides. In addition, treads are  
regulated based on whether or not the alternating tread device is used as a means of egress  
component. Where it is not used for egress purposes, but rather is for convenience only, the  
minimum tread depth may be reduced and the maximum riser height may be increased.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 1012 Ramps  
1012.1 Scope. With the exception of ramped aisles in assembly rooms, curb ramps, and vehicle  
ramps in parking garages used for pedestrian exit access travel, whenever a ramp is used as a  
component anywhere in a means of egress it is necessary that the ramp comply with the  
provisions of this section. Note that where ramps are used as a part of the egress system, every  
ramp must meet these standards, regardless of the occupant load served. Ramped aisles in  
assembly occupancies need only conform to the provisions of Section 1030.  
In addition to those egress provisions, all ramps located within an accessible route of travel  
shall be made to conform to the requirements found in ICC A117.1.  
1012.2 Slope. Whenever any ramp is used in an exit system, the slope of such a ramp shall not  
be steeper than 1 unit vertical in 12 units horizontal \(8.3-percent slope\). Those pedestrian ramps  
not considered a portion of the means of egress may have a greater slope, but may not be steeper  
than a slope of 1 unit vertical in 8 units horizontal \(12.5-percent slope\). For areas of assembly  
seating, Section 1030.14 allows a maximum 1\:8 slope for means of egress ramps not on an  
accessible route.  
1012.5 Minimum dimensions. Because requirements for the widths and capacities of ramps are  
identical to those requirements for widths and capacities of corridors, see discussion of Section  
1020.3\. The net clear width between the handrails is to be no less than 36 inches \(914 mm\),  
differing from the stairway provisions that allow for handrail projections into the required width.  
In fact, all projections into the minimum width requirements of the ramp and its landings are  
prohibited. Where the minimum required width of an egress ramp is established, it shall not be  
diminished at any point in the direction of travel. Where doors enter onto or swing over ramp  
landings, the doors may not, during the course of their swing, reduce the minimum dimension of  
the landing to less than 42 inches \(1,067 mm\). As depicted in Figure 1012-1, in all cases there  
must be at least 42 inches \(1,067 mm\) of width available on the ramp even while the door is  
swinging.  
Figure 1012-1 Intermediate ramp landings.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1012.6 Landings. Any ramp, defined as having a slope steeper than 1 unit vertical in 20 units  
horizontal \(5-percent slope\), must have landings at the top and bottom, at any changes of  
direction, at points of entrance or exiting from the ramp, and at doors. All landings are required  
to have a dimension measured in the direction of the ramp run not less than 5 feet \(1,524 mm\).  
These larger-than-normal dimensions are required to reasonably ensure that disabled persons in  
wheelchairs will have sufficient space to maneuver on any intermediate landings as well as in the  
area at the top and bottom adjacent to the ramp. See Figure 1012-2. Exceptions permit a  
reduction in landing lengths to 36 inches \(914 mm\) in nonaccessible Group R-2 individual  
dwelling units and nonaccessible R-3 occupancies, whereas ramps not on an accessible route in  
other occupancies must only be 48 inches \(1,220 mm\) in length.  
1012.7 Ramp construction. Consistent with the provisions for stairway construction found in  
Section 1011.7, ramps shall be built of materials consistent with the building’s type of  
construction. In addition, exterior ramps and their approaches should be designed in a manner to  
avoid water accumulation.  
Because a ramp has a sloping surface, the potential for accidents resulting from slips and falls  
is greatly increased. It is critically important that the surface of the ramp be made slip-resistant to  
help prevent such accidents. It is imperative that very careful attention be given to the selection  
of materials for ramp surfaces and the methods of finishing such surfaces. Certainly, slick-  
finished materials should be avoided on ramps, unless it can be ensured that they have been  
made slip-resistant by some process.  
Figure 1012-2 Intermediate ramp landings.  
There are a number of products on the market available for treating ramp surfaces that are not  
sufficiently slip-resistant. In many instances, the use of these materials has not proven to be  
completely satisfactory. One method is to install carborundum strips across the width of the ramp  
at appropriate intervals. Other available products can be installed on the ramp surface with an  
adhesive. It is essential that slip-resistant treatments and materials be of reasonably permanent  
nature and securely attached so they can perform the function for which they were installed,  
while at the same time not becoming a potential tripping hazard. Therefore, the slip resistance  
should be proven by tests and be an integral part of the ramp surface.  
1012.8 Handrails. Whenever any ramp in the means of egress has a rise greater than 6 inches  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation\(152 mm\), the ramp shall be provided with handrails on both sides. The detailed requirements for  
the handrails are found in Section 1014. There are no general provisions that allow a handrail on  
only one side of a ramp, nor is there any requirement for intermediate handrails. It should be  
remembered that handrails for ramped aisles in assembly occupancies are regulated by Section  
1030.16.  
1012.10 Edge protection. In order to further protect the user of a ramp, safeguards are required  
along ramp edges as well as along each side of ramp landings. Two different methods, as shown  
in Figure 1012-3, are available for providing compliant edge protection at ramp runs and ramp  
landings. Either method may be used to provide the necessary level of protection. It is acceptable  
to use a curb with a minimum height of 4 inches \(102 mm\) to satisfy the first method. A rail  
located just above the ramp or landing surface will also suffice, as will a wall or similar barrier.  
As an alternative methodology, the surface of the ramp or landing may extend a minimum  
distance of 12 inches \(305 mm\) beyond a vertical plane established from the inside face of a  
complying handrail. Both methods are deemed adequate for preventing a ramp user from an  
unacceptable drop-off at the landing or ramp edge.  
Figure 1012-3 Ramp edge protection.  
Section 1013 Exit Signs  
1013.1 Where required. To properly identify the egress path through a building, it is necessary  
to provide exit signs. Although somewhat vague, these provisions are probably more  
performance oriented than most requirements. The basic provision is that signs are required so  
that the exiting path is clearly indicated. By combining this requirement with Exception 1, it will  
mean that, in general, when two or more means of egress are required from any portion of a  
building, such as from a room, area, floor, or other space, exit signs must be installed at all  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrequired exit and exit access doorways, and at any other location throughout the exiting system  
where deemed necessary by the building official to clearly identify the path of travel to the exit.  
Care must be taken in the placement of the exit signs to ensure they are properly located and  
properly oriented to the direction of travel in the egress system. They need to be easily read by  
persons seeking the exit. Particular care should be taken to see that nothing occurs in the means  
of egress that might tend to obscure or screen the exit sign, or that might cause confusion in  
identifying the exit sign. It is not uncommon in many building plans to find that exit signs are  
shown at what appear to be the appropriate locations, only to later find they are actually installed  
behind ducts, equipment, or other building elements in such a manner that they are not really  
visible to building occupants, or near or over doors that are not the exit. Additionally, the  
presence of banners, signs, and other movable elements may obstruct the view of required exit  
signs. In the placement of exit signs, the use of the space and its impact on clear sight lines to  
exit signs must be considered.  
In certain instances, the exit signs may be present, but they are not oriented to the path of  
travel and to the approaching building occupant. Therefore, they are not visible and are certainly  
not legible to the persons seeking the exit. It is strongly advised that, as one of the last points of  
inspection, and before approving the occupancy of any building, the building inspector or  
building official carefully walk the egress path to ensure the proper installation and effective  
location and orientation of exit signs. It is also important that ceiling-suspended exit signs or exit  
signage extending from a wall do not project below the minimum permitted headroom height of  
80 inches \(2,032 mm\) for projecting elements as required by Section 1003.3.1.  
As occupants proceed along the path of travel through a corridor or exit passageway, they  
typically assume that their direction of travel is taking them to an exit. However, where the  
corridor or exit passageway length is quite extensive, the users may, at some point, make a  
determination that they are traveling in the wrong direction. This could cause the occupants to  
reverse their direction and seek another travel path. For this reason, the provisions require exit  
sign placement within a corridor or exit passageway at points no more than 200 feet \(60,960  
mm\) apart. This method of placement will ensure that no point within the corridor or exit  
passageway is more than 100 feet \(30,480 mm\) from the nearest visible sign.  
The use of exit signs to identify paths of egress travel is usually limited to the exit access  
portions of the building. Once the occupants reach the exits, such signs are typically unnecessary  
as the paths are often direct and single directional. However, in buildings with more complicated  
means of egress systems, it is possible that egress travel within the exits may not be immediately  
apparent to the occupants. For this reason, the mandate for exit signs is extended to those  
portions within exits, such as exit passageways, where such signs are necessary to provide clear  
egress direction for the occupants. Evacuees may be hesitant or even confused when traveling  
within an exit that involves transition from a vertical to a horizontal direction and horizontal  
extension that includes turns and intervening doors within the path of egress. Where travel  
direction is not clear within an exit, it creates uncertainty and causes delays in evacuations under  
threatening conditions. Therefore, the direction of egress travel should be identified by exit signs  
where such direction may not be clearly understood, and all intervening means of egress doors  
within the exits must also be provided with complying exit signs. An example of the appropriate  
use of exit signs within exits is shown in Figure 1013-1.  
Omission of exit signs. Although the installation of exit signs is of paramount importance in  
most instances, there will be cases where the means of egress is abundantly obvious to any  
building occupant. Where the exit point is clearly identifiable, such as at main exterior  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationentrance/exit doors, the exit is essentially its own identifying sign. Where approved by the  
building official, it may not be necessary to install an exit sign at such an obvious exit. In  
addition, exit signs may be omitted in Group U occupancies, and within individual sleeping and  
dwelling units in Group R-1, R-2, and R-3 occupancies. Because of the residential nature of such  
uses, it is felt that exit signs are unnecessary. Exit signs may also be omitted in day rooms,  
sleeping rooms, and dormitories of a Group I-3 occupancy, as requiring exit signs for such an  
occupancy is considered unnecessary. The first exception, which eliminates the need for exit  
signs in areas that need access to only one exit or exit access element, has application to a great  
number of areas within most buildings. It is assumed that the exit path is obvious because of its  
use as the typical entrance to the area or room. It should be noted that the exception applies even  
where multiple means of egress are provided, provided only one of them is required. A final  
exception applies to assembly seating arrangements that occur in Groups A-4 and A-5. Exit signs  
may be omitted in the seating area, provided that the direction to the concourse area is easily  
identified and adequately illuminated. Once reaching the concourse, exit signs identifying the  
exit path and egress doors must be provided.  
Figure 1013-1 Exit sign locations.  
1013.2 Low-level exit signs in Group R-1. To help guide transient occupants of Group R-1  
guest rooms to the exits during emergency conditions, additional exit signs are required within  
the egress system serving the guest rooms of a Group R-1 occupancy. Limiting the application to  
the egress system serving the guest rooms of hotels and other Group R-1 occupancies recognizes  
that the occupants are transient and not familiar with their surroundings. If a corridor or other  
egress component serving guest rooms were to fill with smoke, the general exit signs that are  
located higher in the space could quickly be obscured by the rising smoke. As the space fills with  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsmoke, the evacuees are forced to crawl on the floor to reach the nearest exit. They will be  
confronted with many doors, all looking the same, and will not know which door is the exit. The  
installation of these low-level exit signs assists these persons in safely exiting the building when  
signs at the higher levels are obscured as the smoke layer develops at the ceiling.  
Low-level exit signs also serve to increase fire-fighter safety while on the fire scene. In their  
efforts to evacuate the building occupants, the fire fighters will be in the building when the  
smoke has developed. Although they rely on several other techniques, the fire fighters may also  
become dependent on this low-level signage while trying to locate the doors to the interior exit  
stairway and safely egress the fire floor.  
1013.3 Illumination. Where exit signs are required, they must be illuminated. The source of the  
illumination is not material, provided the level of illumination at the sign meets the minimum  
requirements of the code. Tactile exit signs, required by Section 1013.4, are exempted from the  
illumination requirement for obvious reasons.  
1013.5 Internally illuminated exit signs. Internally illuminated signs include all exit signs that  
generate their own luminosity in some manner. Electrically powered exit signs, including LED,  
incandescent, fluorescent, and electroluminescent signs, in combination with those signs  
considered as self-luminous and photoluminescent, represent the full range of product types  
currently in the market. All such exit signs must be listed and labeled in accordance with the  
provisions of UL 924, Standard for Emergency Lighting and Power Equipment. Consistent with  
most other installation requirements found in the code, the manufacturer’s instructions must be  
followed. The value of visible exit signs is demonstrated by the requirement that exit signs must  
be illuminated at all times.  
1013.6 Externally illuminated exit signs. Although it is uncommon to provide illumination for  
an exit sign from an external source, there are occasions where such methods are used. This  
section regulates the graphics, illumination, and emergency power supply for such signs.  
Although no particular color is specified for exit signs, it is required that the color and design  
of the signs, the lettering, the arrows, and other symbols on the sign provide good contrast so as  
to increase legibility. The letters of the word exit are required to be at least 6 inches \(152 mm\) in  
height and have a width of stroke of not less than ¾ inch \(19.1 mm\). By specifying the letter  
spacing, the code ensures that the letters are not placed too close together and that the signs will  
be legible and more effective as a result. Additionally, when a larger sign is provided, it is  
important the lettering be increased proportionally.  
When the illumination of the sign is from an external source, that source must be capable of  
producing a light intensity of at least 5 foot-candles \(54 lux\) at all points over the face of the  
sign. Measurement of the 5 foot-candles \(54 lux\) from an external source can be made by a light  
meter. The measurement of the equivalent luminance, however, from an internal source is more  
difficult. That is why the code relies on a testing laboratory that has examined, certified, and  
labeled the exit sign. In labeling such a sign, the testing agency is certifying, among other things,  
that the light level is at least that required by the code.  
Externally illuminated exit signs are required to be illuminated at all times and must provide  
continued operation for a minimum of one- and one-half hours after the loss of the normal power  
supply. This backup power supply shall be from a complying storage battery system, unit  
equipment, or other approved on-site, independent source. The exception addresses illumination  
that is provided independent of external power supplies and, therefore, does not require  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcompliance with the emergency power provisions.  
Section 1014 Handrails  
A handrail is defined in Section 202 as “a horizontal or sloping rail intended for grasping by the  
hand for guidance or support.  
” The IBC mandates, with limited exceptions, that handrails be  
provided to assist the users of stairways and ramps during normal travel conditions. In addition, a  
handrail must be available for support in case of a misstep or other occurrence that might cause  
the user to stumble and fall. Numerous criteria for the design and installation of effective  
handrails are set forth in this section.  
1014.2 Height. In past building codes, the height of handrails was traditionally established  
within a range of at least 30 inches \(762 mm\) and not more than 34 inches \(864 mm\) vertically  
above the leading edge of treads of the stairway that the handrails serve. However, research has  
shown that handrails better serve stair users if located in a range higher than this traditional  
location. Higher handrails can be more readily reached by adult stair users and, interestingly  
enough, handrails at the higher elevation are also more usable by very small persons, including  
toddlers. Where handrails are required, they must be located at least 34 inches \(864 mm\) and not  
more than 38 inches \(965 mm\) vertically, measured from the nosing of the stair treads to the top  
of the rail. A reduction in the handrail height range is provided for alternating tread devices and  
ship ladders due to the steepness of travel.  
Handrails are not required on the entire stairway but only on the “flight” of the stairway with  
an additional requirement for extensions at landings. Where a handrail transitions from one flight  
of stairs to another at a dog-leg or switch-back stair landing, the base code requirement for  
handrail extensions or for handrail continuity often creates the need for some type of transition.  
Exception 1 allows for a more gradual variation in the height even though it will allow for  
portions of the handrail to exceed the normal 38-inch maximum—the belief being that a  
“continuous” handrail is probably more important than staying within the height limitation.  
Exception 2 is more comprehensive in that it also addresses the transition from a handrail to a  
guard; however, its application is limited to residential occupancies.  
In many instances, stairways and ramps are constructed in conjunction with landings,  
balconies, porches, and other building components. A common condition occurs with the typical  
switchback stairway, where a substantial elevation change can occur from one flight to a lower  
adjacent flight. When those components or conditions are more than 30 inches \(762 mm\) above  
the adjacent ground level or surface below, they must be protected by guards meeting the  
requirements of Section 1015, which requires guards to be a minimum of 42 inches \(1,067 mm\)  
in height. Therefore, compliance with requirements for handrail heights in Section 1014.2 is not  
considered sufficient by the code for guard protection. The handrail must be supplemented with  
an additional element at a greater height in order to meet the provisions for guards. See Figure  
1014-1\. As a note, one item often missed when looking at the provisions is that the glazed side of  
a stairway must be protected by a guard unless the glazing meets the strength and attachment  
requirements of Section 1607.9.  
1014.3 Handrail graspability. To be truly effective, handrails must be graspable. The code  
establishes specific criteria for handrail shape intending to define “graspability” in prescriptive  
terms. A performance alternative is also provided indicating that the configuration of the handrail  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcan be such that it provides an equivalent, graspable shape. In prescriptive terms, the handgrip  
portion of the handrail must not be less than 1¼ inches \(32 mm\) or more than 2 inches \(51 mm\)  
in a circular cross-sectional dimension, or where the cross section of the handrail is not circular,  
an alternative shape is described by the code and illustrated in Figure 1014-2. Such handrails are  
considered as Type I handrails and are permitted for use in all occupancies. Handrail profiles  
having a perimeter dimension greater than 6¼ inches \(160 mm\), identified as Type II handrails,  
are also acceptable where installed in specified residential applications.  
Figure 1014-1 Guard and handrail.  
Research has shown that Type II handrails have graspability that is essentially equal to or  
greater than the graspability of handrails meeting the long-accepted and codified shape and size  
defined as Type I. The key features of the graspability of Type II handrails are graspable finger  
recesses on both sides of the handrail. These recesses allow users to firmly grip a properly  
proportioned grasping surface on the top of the handrail, ensuring that the user can tightly retain  
a grip on the handrail for all forces that are associated with attempts to arrest a fall. Examples of  
complying Type II handrails are illustrated in Figure 1014-3.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1014-2 Noncircular handrail.  
Many persons are incapable of exerting sufficient finger pressure on a plane surface, such as  
that provided by a rectangular handrail. To get adequate support or to adequately grasp the  
handrail, it is necessary to provide those persons with one of the shapes that the code specifies.  
Where a handrail with a complying profile is installed, it is possible for those persons to actually  
wrap their fingers around that portion of the handrail and, thereby, obtain better support.  
1014.4 Continuity. The handrails must be continuous for the full length of the ramp or the flight  
of stairs, thereby affording the user support throughout the entire flight. Within dwelling units,  
handrails are permitted to terminate at a starting newel or ramp or stair volute that is located on  
the first tread. In addition, a newel post may interrupt the handrail continuity at a stair landing.  
These types of terminations have been found in residences for years without a record of  
accidents or lawsuits for an unsafe condition.  
Handrail brackets or balusters are not considered obstructions, provided they are attached to  
the bottom surface of the handrail and do not project horizontally beyond the sides of the  
handrail within 1½ inches \(38 mm\) of the bottom of the rail, as shown in Figure 1014-4. This  
provision is used to regulate the method of support so that the handrail is graspable at any point  
along its length. A lesser vertical clearance at the handrail’s bottom surface is permitted where  
the perimeter of the handrail exceeds 4 inches \(102 mm\). As the perimeter of the handrail  
increases, the vertical clearance may be reduced.  
1014.6 Handrail extensions. Other than locations where handrails are continuous from one  
flight of stairs to the next, the handrails must extend horizontally not less than 12 inches \(305  
mm\) beyond the top riser. In addition, under such conditions they must also continue to slope  
beyond the bottom riser for a distance equal to the depth of one tread. See Figure 1014-5. The  
purpose of the extension of the handrail at the top and bottom of the stairs is to provide minimal  
additional facility in assisting the stair user. As such, the handrail must extend in the same  
direction as the travel along the stairway or ramp. This extension is not required for aisle  
handrails in rooms or spaces used for assembly purposes, for handrails within a dwelling unit  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthat is not required to be accessible, as well as handrails for alternating tread devices and ship  
ladders. Somewhat similar conditions are applicable where ramp handrails do not continue from  
one ramp run to the next. For such noncontinuous handrails, a minimum extension of 12 inches  
\(305 mm\) is required, as shown in Figure 1014-6. Handrails for both stairs and ramps must  
return to a wall, guard, or the walking surface unless they continue and connect to a handrail of  
an adjacent stair flight or ramp run. The reason for requiring that the ends of handrails be  
returned to the wall, floor, or landing, or end at a guard or similar safety terminal, is to avoid the  
possibility of loose clothing or other articles being caught on the projection of the handrail.  
Figure 1014-3 Dimensional properties of Type II handrails.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1014-4 Handrail continuity.  
Figure 1014-5 Stairway handrail extensions.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1014-6 Ramp handrail extensions.  
1014.7 Clearance. In view of the desire to make the handrail graspable, and considering the  
requirement that the handrail be continuous, it is necessary to provide a clear space of at least 1½  
inches \(38 mm\) between the handrail and any abutting construction to avoid injury to fingers.  
See Figure 1014-7.  
Figure 1014-7 Handrail clearance.  
1014.8 Projections. As stated earlier, when the code specifies a required width of a component  
in the egress system, it generally intends that width to be clear and unobstructed. One permitted  
projection is for handrails, which may project a maximum distance of 4½ inches \(114 mm\) from  
each side of the ramp or stair, as shown in Figure 1014-8. In addition, stringers, trim, and other  
features are permitted to project into the required width up to 4½ inches \(114 mm\) at or below  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe handrail height. Again, unless a projection into the minimum required width of the stairway  
is expressly allowed, none is permitted.  
Unlike the permissible projections of handrails into the required stairway width, such  
projections into the required ramp width are limited. In no case may the distance between ramp  
handrails be less than 36 inches \(914 mm\).  
1014.9 Intermediate handrails. Where the occupant load served by a stairway becomes  
significant, additional handrails may be necessary to assist stair users. The requirement is based  
on the required capacity of the stair established by Section 1005.3.1, not the actual width, and  
mandates that at no point shall the required capacity or minimum width be more than 30 inches  
\(762 mm\) from a handrail. See Figure 1014-9. It is difficult to determine the exact point at which  
intermediate handrails are required, as the handrail projection into the required width can vary  
from one design to the next. It should be noted that the measurement is to be taken in regard to  
the handrail location, which is permitted to extend a maximum of 4½ inches \(114 mm\) into the  
required width. Where the maximum encroachment occurs on each side of the stairway, an  
intermediate handrail must be provided where the required width exceeds 69 inches \(1,752 mm\).  
A lesser required width would apply where the handrails do not extend the full 4½ inches \(114  
mm\) into the minimum required stairway width. As an additional safeguard for wide  
monumental stairs, the handrails must be located along the anticipated travel path of the stair  
users.  
Figure 1014-8 Projections into stairway width.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1014-9 Intermediate handrails.  
Section 1015 Guards  
1015.2 Where required. In this section, the code provides for guard protection at open sides  
along walking surfaces, such as aisles, mezzanines, stairways, ramps, and landings, that are more  
than 30 inches \(762 mm\) above grade or a floor surface below. Also, protection is required for  
the glazed sides of stairways, ramps, and landings located more than 30 inches \(762 mm\) above  
the floor or grade below, unless the glazing complies with the strength and attachment provisions  
in Section 1607.9 for live loads. The need for guards in these circumstances is evident, although  
the arbitrary limit of 30 inches \(762 mm\) is subject to conjecture. Nevertheless, in the case of the  
IBC, it is assumed that the maximum height differential of 30 inches \(762 mm\) without guard  
protection does not create a significant safety hazard.  
In the determination of the difference in elevation, an objective method is established for  
measuring the height of the walking surface above the grade below. Rather than taking this  
measurement to the ground level or floor directly below the edge of the walking surface, the  
code requires the height of the walking surface above grade to be based on the lowest point  
within 36 inches \(914 mm\) horizontally from the edge of the deck, porch, or other elevated  
element. This approach recognizes that a sloped site sometimes occurs adjacent to a deck, porch,  
or similar walking surface, increasing the level of hazard. This method of measurement is  
illustrated in Figure 1015-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1015-1 Determination of guard applicability.  
There are eight exceptions that identify locations or situations where guards complying with  
Section 1015 are not required. These exceptions fall into essentially two categories where, for  
obvious reasons, guards would be inappropriate\:  
1\. Commercial and industrial applications. Guards are not required on the loading side of  
loading docks or piers, nor along vehicle-service pits inaccessible to the public. Such  
guards would severely restrict the work that takes place in these areas. The guards can  
also be eliminated at transportation platforms where they would interfere with passenger  
boarding operations.  
2\. Stage and platform areas. Because of the nature of activities involving performance stages  
or platforms, it is impractical to provide guards in various locations. Guards may be  
omitted on the audience side of stages and raised platforms, at runways or side stages  
used for presentations, at any vertical openings in the performance area, and at elevated  
walking surfaces used to access or use lighting or equipment. Guards also may be omitted  
along any stairs that may lead from the auditorium area to a stage or platform; however,  
handrails must still be provided under the provisions of Section 1014.  
Variations in minimum required guard heights are common in assembly seating areas. In order to  
achieve adequate lines of sight for the assembly audience seated in a tiered configuration, it is  
often necessary to provide for guards of a height lower than required by the provisions of Section  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1015\. Therefore, modified guard heights are permitted under the provisions of Section 1030.17.  
1015.3 Height. Where guard protection is required, the guard must be of adequate height to  
prevent someone from falling over the edge of the protected area. Therefore, the code establishes  
42 inches \(1,067 mm\) as a minimum height that is acceptable for guard protection. In the case of  
a guard adjacent to a stairway, the minimum height of 42 inches \(1,067 mm\) is measured  
vertically above the leading edge of the tread. A number of exceptions to the minimum required  
guard height address two different conditions\: guards adjacent to stairs and guards adjacent to  
other walking surfaces.  
Exception 3 allows the top rail of a stairway handrail in Group R-3 occupancies and within  
individual dwelling units in Group R-2 occupancies to be considered an adequate guard height,  
provided the handrail is located between 34 inches \(864 mm\) and 38 inches \(965 mm\) measured  
vertically from the leading edge of the stair tread nosing. Exception 6 is similar, but with  
additional restrictions for stair handrails that also serve as the guard on stairways in limited  
Group F areas to coordinate with federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration  
\(OSHA\) requirements. Exception 2 coordinates with Exception 3 but in locations where the  
guard is separate from the handrail. Exception 5 allows alternating tread devices and ship ladders  
to have guards with top rails serving as handrails located at a reduced height above the tread  
nosings.  
The minimum required guard height is reduced by Exception 1 to 36 inches \(914 mm\) in  
certain residential occupancies to provide coordination with the International Residential Code®  
\(IRC®\). It should be noted that the scope of the exception is consistent with that of the IRC, the  
building cannot exceed three stories in height and each individual dwelling unit must be provided  
with a separate means of egress. Exception 4 reminds the code user that modifications are also  
provided in Section 1030.17 for stadiums, arenas, theaters, and other assembly areas to address  
the impact guard heights have on the lines of sight in some spectator locations.  
It is important to note that the minimum height criteria for guards only apply to those guards  
that are required by Section 1015.2. The minimum required guard height does not apply to  
optional barriers that are installed.  
1015.4 Opening limitations. Along with a minimum height requirement for guards, the code  
also requires that for open-type rails, intermediate members or ornamentation be provided so that  
a sphere 4 inches \(102 mm\) in diameter cannot pass through any opening\: a requirement that  
prevents individuals, particularly small children, from falling or climbing through the guard  
assembly. This limitation applies to the lower 36 inches \(914 mm\) of the guard. At a height  
above 36 inches \(914 mm\) to a height of 42 inches \(1,067 mm\), the opening size may be  
increased, provided a sphere 4⅜ inches \(111 mm\) in diameter cannot pass through the opening.  
See Figure 1015-2.  
Several exceptions increase the maximum opening size permitted in an open guard. The  
triangular area formed by the tread, riser, and bottom rail of the guard is limited in size to where  
a sphere of 6 inches \(152 mm\) in diameter cannot pass through the opening. Because of the  
unusual configuration of a stairway and its required guard, as well as the location of the  
triangular opening, an increased size is deemed reasonable. This configuration is shown in  
Figure 1015-3.  
In commercial, industrial, and security uses where the public is not invited \(therefore, the  
guard is typically not subject to children crawling or falling through\), open guards may have  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationintermediate members or ornamentation spaced so that a 21-inch-diameter \(533-mm\) sphere  
cannot pass through. This exception applies to those elevated walking surfaces used for access to  
areas containing electrical, mechanical, or plumbing systems or equipment, as well as platforms  
provided for the use of such systems or equipment. It also applies to elevated areas in  
occupancies of Group I-3, F, H, or S where access to the public is not available.  
In order to significantly improve the lines of sight for rows located immediately behind the  
guard in assembly areas, an exception reduces the amount of infill provided in the guard at the  
end of the aisles. From a height of 26 inches \(660 mm\) to the top of the rail, the opening need  
only be small enough that a sphere 8 inches \(203 mm\) in diameter cannot pass through. See  
Figure 1015-4.  
Applicable only within dwelling units and sleeping units in Groups R-2 and R-3, a slightly  
larger opening is permitted in guards at the open sides of stairs. See Figure 1015-5. The  
maximum opening size of 4⅜ inches \(111 mm\) will permit the installation of two balusters,  
rather than three, on 10-inch \(254-mm\) treads without compromising significant safety in regard  
to infants crawling through the openings. The greater hazard that cannot be addressed in the code  
is that of infants falling down the stairs.

@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1015-3 Guard openings at stairs.  
Figure 1015-4 Assembly seating guards.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1015-5 Guard opening limitations for Group R-2 and R-3 occupancies.  
1015.8 Window openings. Historical data have shown that each year a considerable number of  
children fall from windows in residential buildings. It has been estimated that a sizable  
percentage of those falls occurred through windows with a low sill height. The minimum clear  
opening height of 36 inches \(915 mm\) was established not only to place the lowest point of the  
window opening above the center of gravity of most children to address accidental falls through  
the window, but also to reduce the potential for small children to climb onto the sill and possibly  
fall through the opening. It should be noted that the requirement is only applicable to those  
buildings where the hazard to children is common—buildings housing Group R-2 or R-3  
occupancies where dwelling units are located. Buildings classified as Groups R-2 and R-3 where  
only sleeping units are present, such as Group R-2 dormitories, are not regulated under these  
provisions.  
The measurements on both the interior and exterior sides of the building are to be taken from  
the same point, the top of the window sill, providing for consistent application of the provisions.  
See Figure 1015-6. Fixed glazing is permitted within 36 inches \(915 mm\) of the floor, as are  
openings that do not allow for the passage of a 4-inch-diameter \(102-mm\) sphere. In addition,  
openings that are sufficiently protected by complying window fall prevention devices and  
windows provided with window opening control devices are not regulated for the minimum sill  
height.  
The requirement for window clear opening \(sill\) height does not affect the application of the  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIBC provision addressing emergency escape and rescue windows. Where a window regulated by  
this section occurs in a sleeping room and is designated as the required emergency escape and  
rescue opening, it will have both a minimum and a maximum required sill height.  
Figure 1015-6 Minimum window sill height.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1016-1 Egress through intervening.  
Section 1016 Exit Access  
The exit access is identified as the initial component of the means of egress system—that portion  
between any occupied point in a building and an exit. Leading to an exterior exit door at the level  
of exit discharge, an exterior egress stairway or ramp, or the door of an exit passageway, interior  
exit stairway, interior exit ramp, or horizontal exit, the exit access makes up the vast majority of  
any building’s floor area.  
1016.2 Egress through intervening spaces. Basically, the code intends that access to exits  
should be direct from the room or area under consideration. This section, however, makes some  
modifications where, under certain circumstances, exit paths may be arranged through adjoining  
rooms or spaces rather than directly into corridors or exit elements, such as interior exit stairways  
or exit passageways, or through exterior doors.  
Under Item 2, it is permissible to provide egress through an adjoining room or space, provided  
the adjacent rooms or spaces are accessory to each other. In this context, the term accessory  
describes an interrelationship between the adjoining spaces based on their use, and not  
necessarily their size. Where egress must occur through an intervening space, it is important that  
such a space be under the same control as the initial space. Egress through such an intervening  
area to an exit must be direct and obvious so that the occupant is well aware of the exit path. It is  
assumed that a discernible egress path through an area that essentially is an extension of the area  
served poses no significant hazard to exiting, provided travel does not enter a hazardous area.  
Egress travel is not permitted to pass through a room or space classified as a Group H occupancy  
unless permitted under the conditions of the exception. See Figure 1016-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1016-2 Egress through stockrooms.  
Where the room of origin is a Group H occupancy, an exception permits the means of egress  
to pass through adjoining rooms or spaces designated as equal or lesser hazards. Because the  
hazard level is not increased along the egress path through the intervening room, the general  
prohibition does not apply. For example, occupants of a Group H-2 occupancy may travel  
through a Group H-3 space because of the reduction in hazard level that is anticipated.  
This section is also concerned with the arrangement of the exit path in that it puts restrictions  
on certain spaces that are considered to present an undue probability of obstruction to free egress  
travel. Therefore, the code prohibits the exit path from passing through kitchens, store rooms,  
closets, and spaces used for similar purposes where the probability of things obstructing the path  
of travel is substantially greater. An exception permits travel through a stockroom provided four  
conditions are met, as illustrated in Figure 1016-2.  
As is so frequently the case throughout the code, exceptions are made for rooms within  
dwelling and sleeping units. Although egress from dwelling units or sleeping units shall not lead  
through other sleeping areas or through toilet rooms or bathrooms, it is permitted through a  
kitchen area within the same unit.  
An even greater concern is the potential for the egress system to be completely unusable.  
Therefore, the code specifies that exit access cannot pass through any room or area that can be  
locked to prevent egress.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1016.2.1 Multiple tenants. Where any floor of a building is occupied by more than one tenant, it  
is critical that access to all of the required exits be accomplished without passing through any  
adjacent tenant spaces. This condition also applies to dwelling units and sleeping units. Because  
it is almost always impossible to have control over what occurs in the tenant spaces of others, it  
is important that the exit system not be reliant on an egress path through any neighboring tenant  
spaces. The exception allows relatively small tenant spaces to egress through larger tenant spaces  
under specified conditions. Independent egress from the smaller tenant spaces is not required  
where such spaces are limited in size, provided they are classified to an occupancy group similar  
to that of the main occupancy and their means of egress cannot be locked. An example might be  
a branch bank or fast-food restaurant tenant that is located within a large retail store.  
Section 1017 Exit Access Travel Distance  
1017.1 General. In this section, the code is concerned that the means of egress be accessible in  
terms of their arrangement so that the distance of travel from any occupied point in the building  
to an exit is not excessive. The IBC, therefore, establishes maximum distances to exits from any  
occupiable point of the building. This distance is referred to as the travel distance. Travel  
distance is the distance that a building occupant must travel from the most remote, occupiable  
portion of the building to the door of an interior exit stairway or ramp, an exit passageway, or a  
horizontal exit; to an exterior egress stairway or exterior egress ramp; or to an exterior exit door  
located at the level of exit discharge. A travel limit is only imposed to the nearest exit  
component, not to all required exits from the room, floor, or building.  
Each of these exit elements in a means of egress system is considered to represent a sufficient  
level of safety such that the code is no longer concerned about the distance that the building  
occupant must travel to reach the eventual safe place. On the top floor of the world’s tallest  
buildings, the distance to exits, referred to as the travel distance, is measured on that floor from  
the most remote occupiable point to the point where the building occupant enters the interior exit  
stairway. The fact that the building occupant then has dozens of floors of stairway to traverse  
before exiting the building is not a consideration in dealing with distance to exits. Indirectly, in  
establishing a maximum distance of travel to a point of reasonable safety, the code is imposing a  
time factor on the ability of the building occupant to travel from the point of occupancy to a  
relatively safe place either outside or within the building.  
1017.2 Limitations. Basically, the code states that travel distance to an exit may not exceed the  
distances found in Table 1017.2. For most moderate-hazard occupancies, the travel limitation is  
200 feet \(60,960 mm\) in nonsprinklered buildings and 250 feet \(76,200 mm\) in buildings  
provided throughout with an automatic sprinkler system. However, the travel limitations vary  
from these distances in occupancies considered as low hazard and high hazard. Fully sprinklered  
Group B occupancies are permitted travel distances of 300 feet \(91,440 mm\). In low-hazard  
factories and warehouses, as well as utility buildings, the maximum travel distance without  
sprinklers is 300 feet \(91,440 mm\) and 400 feet \(121,920 mm\) where the building is fully  
sprinklered. Travel distance varies for high-hazard occupancies from a low of 75 feet \(22,860  
mm\) in a Group H-1 to a high of 200 feet \(60,960 mm\) in a Group H-5. Those institutional  
occupancies classified as Groups I-2, I-3, and I-4 are permitted a maximum travel distance of  
200 feet \(60,960 mm\) in a sprinklered building. In the situations where a Group I-4 is permitted  
to be without sprinklers, the travel distance is limited to 150 feet \(45,720 mm\).  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTo alert code users to the fact that there are also other code sections that affect travel distance  
requirements, the notes to Table 1017.2 identify several locations where special requirements  
may be found, including\:  
1\. Section 402.8. Travel distance within mall tenant spaces or within the mall itself. The  
section limits travel distance within the mall to 200 feet \(60,960 mm\). The travel distance  
within individual tenant spaces is also limited to 200 feet \(60,960 mm\).  
2\. Section 1030.7. Travel distance within an assembly building having smoke-protected  
assembly seating or open-air seating. Where smoke-protective assembly seating is  
provided, the travel distance from every seat to the nearest concourse entrance is limited  
to 200 feet \(60,960 mm\). Travel from the concourse entrance to a stair ramp or walk on  
the exterior of the building is also limited to 200 feet \(60,960 mm\). Where the seating is  
open to the exterior, the maximum travel distance from each seat to the building’s exterior  
shall not exceed 400 feet \(121,920 mm\). In such buildings of Type I or II construction,  
travel distance is unlimited.  
3\. Section 3103.4. Travel distance in temporary structures. The maximum exit access travel  
distance permitted in a temporary structure is 100 feet \(30,480 mm\).  
1017.2.1 Exterior egress balcony increase. As depicted in Figure 1017-1, the travel limitations  
specified in Table 1017.2 may be increased by an additional 100 feet \(30,480 mm\) if the  
increased travel distance is the last portion of the travel distance on an exterior egress balcony.  
As an example, for a Group B occupancy, either the 200 feet \(60,960 mm\) in a nonsprinklered  
building or the 300 feet \(91,440 mm\) in a sprinklered building may be increased to 300 feet and  
400 feet \(91,440 mm and 121,920 mm\), respectively, if in each instance the last 100 feet \(30,480  
mm\) of travel distance is on an exterior egress balcony. Simply stated, all travel, up to a  
maximum of 100 feet \(30,480 mm\), that occurs beyond that permitted by Table 1017.2 must  
occur on an exterior egress balcony.  
1017.2.2 Groups F-1 and S-1 increase. The general travel distance limitation of 250 feet  
\(76,200 mm\) in fully sprinklered moderate-hazard factory and storage buildings can be increased  
where two conditions reflecting building height are met. Extended travel to an exit is permitted  
for Group F-1 and S-1 occupancies where such occupancies are single story and have a  
minimum floor to deck height of 24 feet \(7315 mm\). The increased travel distance recognizes  
information gained through fire modeling and egress times, based in major part on the Report to  
the California State Fire Marshal on Exit Access Travel Distance of 400 Feet by Task Group  
400, December 20, 2010 and the subsequent Fire Modeling Analysis Report dated July 20, 2011.  
These reports provide the technical basis for increasing the travel distance based on the required  
conditions.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1017-1 Egress balcony travel distance increases.  
1017.3 Measurement. Travel distance is one of the most difficult features of the egress system  
to determine in either the design or the plan review stage. Travel distance is intended to be  
measured along the natural, unobstructed path available to the building occupant. See Figure  
1017-2\. That path is often determined by the location of partitions, doors, furniture, equipment,  
and similar objects. Many of these objects are reasonably portable and, as a consequence, the  
actual path available is frequently and easily altered. Although it is obvious that travel is to be  
measured around permanent construction and building elements, how to measure travel in areas  
with tables, chairs, furnishings, cabinets, and similar temporary or movable fixtures is debatable.  
The preferred approach, conservative in nature, would dictate using the right-angle method  
for measuring travel distance. This method recognizes that obstacles such as desks, shelving,  
modular furnishings, and so on would cause travel to negotiate around such objects. The  
increased distance determined by right-angle measurement would account for such travel. On the  
other hand, the straight-line method would assume there are no obstructions along the measured  
travel path. Although such conditions at times exist, it is seldom that a straight-line path of travel  
will always be available. Although within private offices and similar small areas the straight-line  
approach would seem to cause no great concern, the method of measurement could be critical in  
larger spaces such as home improvement centers or department stores. Care should be taken to  
measure the travel distance in a manner that best represents the actual means of egress travel  
through the space.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1017-2 Measurement of travel distance.  
Although the general requirement requires travel distance to be measured until the occupant’s  
path of travel reaches the entrance to an exit, in open parking garages the travel distance need  
only be measured to the closest riser of an exit access stairway. Coordinated with the provisions  
of Section 1006.3.2, Exception Item 4, and Section 1019.3, Item 6, this allowance recognizes  
that stairways in open parking garages need not be enclosed.  
1017.3.1 Exit access stairways and ramps. Since travel distance is measured until the entrance  
of an exit is reached, travel on exit access stairways and ramps must be included in the  
measurement. Exit access stairways and ramps do not provide the degree of fire resistance  
required of interior exit stairways and ramps. Therefore, travel on such stairways and ramps must  
be included in evaluating compliance with the travel distance provisions.  
1017.3.2 Atriums. Because of the potential for smoke spread to upper levels within an atrium,  
the travel distance at upper levels within the atrium is limited to 200 feet \(60,960 mm\). If the  
egress path does not pass through the atrium or is located at the bottom of the atrium, the general  
travel distance requirements of Section 1017.2 are used since there is no increase in hazard.  
Section 1018 Aisles  
As a portion of the exit access, aisles are primarily regulated for minimum width purposes.  
Aisles typically serve occupant travel from adjoining aisle accessways and often merge into a  
main aisle. Aisles are commonly found in those buildings that contain furniture, fixtures, or  
equipment.  
1018.1 General. This section requires that aisles and aisle accessways be provided in all  
occupied portions of the exit access that contain seats, tables, furnishings, displays, and similar  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfixtures or equipment. Primarily, this would have application to occupied-use areas or rooms  
where it is necessary to provide a circulation system so that building occupants will have  
reasonable means for moving around in the occupied spaces, as well as have access to corridors  
and other components of the egress system. It is customary to think of aisles in such facilities as  
theaters where an aisle system is installed to serve the fixed-seating areas. However, this section  
does not apply to such uses. Aisles in assembly areas, including those with seating at tables, such  
as in restaurants, are regulated solely under the provisions of Section 1030. The provisions of  
this section apply to circulation systems through open office areas, retail sales rooms,  
manufacturing areas, warehouse facilities, and other spaces with similar features. As mentioned,  
aisles serving assembly areas, including grandstands and bleachers, are to comply with Section  
1030\. Also, all aisles located within an accessible route of travel must also comply with Chapter  
11.  
The minimum required width of aisles may vary according to the occupancy in which the  
aisles are located; the nature of the use area that the aisles serve; the occupant load served by the  
aisles; and even, in some instances, the type of occupant served. In public areas of Group B and  
M occupancies, such as open offices, retail sales areas, and similar spaces, the minimum required  
clear width of any aisle is consistent with the width required for corridors based upon the  
conditions of use. Section 1020.3 is referenced for minimum required width. In nonpublic areas,  
where the number of employees or other persons served by the aisle is less than 50 and the aisle  
is not required to be accessible, a minimum required width of only 28 inches \(711 mm\) is  
mandated. All aisles are to be unobstructed, except for those permitted projections such as  
nonstructural trim and doors. In all cases, the minimum width of an aisle cannot be less than the  
width needed to satisfy the calculated width requirements of Section 1005.3.2.  
It is important to realize that the first element of any means of egress system is typically an  
aisle accessway, which then leads to an aisle. The code regulates aisle accessways to some  
degree in Group M occupancies, as well as in assembly spaces per Section 1030, but it is silent  
for all other occupancy classifications. The building official must determine at what point an  
aisle accessway becomes an aisle and must be regulated for minimum width in accordance with  
this section.  
1018.4 Aisle accessways in Group M. Aisle accessways are regulated within merchandise pads  
of Group M mercantile occupancies. A merchandise pad is defined as the merchandise display  
area that contains multiple counters, shelves, racks, and other movable fixtures. Every element  
within a merchandise pad must adjoin a minimum 30-inch-wide \(762-mm\) aisle accessway on  
each side. Travel within a merchandise pad is also limited, with a maximum common path of  
travel of 30 feet \(9,144 mm\). This limitation is extended to 75 feet \(22,880 mm\) in those areas  
serving a maximum occupant load of 50.  
Section 1019 Exit Access Stairways and Ramps  
By definition, an exit access stairway is “a stairway within the exit access portion of the means  
of egress system.  
” Any stairway that is not protected by a fire-resistive enclosure as regulated by  
Section 1023 and used as an “exit” component in the means of egress is to be regulated by this  
section. Located within the exit access portion of the means of egress, an exit access stairway  
generally has no inherent fire protection. Travel on an exit access stairway is considered to be  
unprotected travel. However, where the floor openings created to accommodate exit access  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstairways and ramps do not meet any of the conditions set forth in Exceptions 1 through 9,  
enclosure of the exit access stairway is necessary. The required enclosure is intended to restrict  
the spread of fire, smoke, and gases vertically through a multistory building and is not intended  
for the protection of occupants during the exiting process. The exceptions provide multiple  
conditions, which either eliminate the requirement for any type of enclosure or provide some  
other means of addressing openings between stories. The allowances and exceptions established  
in this section also apply to exit access ramps.  
1019.3 Occupancies other than Groups I-2 and I-3. A variety of exceptions have been  
established where the enclosure of exit access stairways is not required. However, none of these  
situations are applicable to Group I-2 and I-3 occupancies. Due to the desire to create smoke  
compartmentation vertically in such institutional buildings, it is important that all floor openings  
between stories in Groups I-2 and I-3 be protected with shaft enclosures in order to maintain the  
mandated fire and smoke separation between smoke compartments.  
Exception 1 emphasizes a fundamental concept of the IBC that is applicable under most  
conditions—two adjacent stories may be open to each other provided such stories do not  
atmospherically communicate with any other stories. The intent of Exception 1 is that when any  
two stories are open to one another, neither may be open to yet another story. This is to prevent  
the formation of an unprotected vertical shaft through more than two stories. This does not mean  
that the stories under consideration cannot have access to other floors. They can, but complying  
enclosures must be provided in order to do so. However, this provision does not allow for the  
enclosure of an interior exit stairway to be interrupted by unenclosed flights.  
Exception 4, applicable only in fully sprinklered buildings, addresses limited-size exit access  
stairway openings that are protected by sprinklers and draft curtains rather than fire-resistance-  
rated enclosures. By limiting the size of the openings, along with the installation of draft curtains  
and closely spaced sprinklers, the code assumes that the vertical openings in sprinklered  
buildings do not present an untenable condition. The purpose of the required draft curtain is to  
trap heat so that the sprinklers will operate and cool the gases that are rising. The curtain is not a  
fabric; it is constructed of materials consistent with the type of construction of the building. In  
other than mercantile and business occupancies, the use of this method is limited to openings  
connecting four or fewer stories. Although required exit access travel is permitted on stairways  
meeting Exception 4, such travel is limited to only one adjacent story as set forth in Section  
1006.3.2.  
Section 1020 Corridors  
The IBC contains a definition of the term corridor. Defined as “an enclosed exit access  
component that defines and provides a path of egress travel,  
” the determination as to when a  
corridor exists is essentially left to the building official.  
For the purpose of the code, a corridor is typically a space where the building occupant has  
very limited choices as to paths or directions of travel. The available path is restricted and is  
usually bordered by occupied-use spaces. As a consequence, it is potentially exposed to fires that  
might occur in those enclosed spaces. Generally speaking, in a building space of this type, the  
occupant has only two choices as far as direction of travel through the exiting system is  
concerned. For that reason, it is sometimes necessary for the building official to evaluate the  
planned layout of an area and determine whether the space presents a potential fire-hazard  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationexposure to building occupants, as any regular, well-defined corridor might. If the determination  
is that the fire-exposure potential is the same, the building space should be made to comply with  
requirements for corridors.  
To provide for a greater degree of consistency in the identification or determination of  
corridors, some jurisdictions have established a set of guidelines that expand on the definition in  
the IBC. An excellent example addresses four common characteristics of corridors as regulated  
in the code.  
1\. It is a space formed by enclosing walls or construction over 6 feet \(1,828 mm\) in height,  
2\. It has a length-to-width ratio greater than 3 to 1,  
3\. Its primary function is for the movement of occupants in the means of egress system, and  
4\. It has a length greater than that permitted for a dead-end condition.  
All four conditions must be present for the element to be considered a corridor. There are  
many rooms that meet the first, second, and fourth conditions, but their primary use is for  
something other than the movement of occupants in the egress system. An open office system  
may have spaces that meet Conditions 2, 3, and 4; however, the walls are not over 6 feet \(1,828  
mm\) in height. In such a space, the egress paths would be regulated as aisles or aisle accessways.  
It also makes little sense to designate a space as a corridor where it conforms to Conditions 1, 2,  
and 3 but is very limited in length, as the travel time through the space will be quite short. This  
approach is just one method for providing uniformity in defining a corridor; there are  
undoubtedly others that also help in the application of the code’s intent. Of course, the definition  
of a corridor is not as critical where it is not required to be fire-resistance rated.  
1020.2 Construction. The thresholds found in Table 1020.2 indicate at what point a fire-  
resistance-rated corridor must be provided. Where required by the table, walls of corridors shall  
be considered fire partitions, and as such shall be regulated by the provisions of Section 708. The  
provisions in Section 708 also address the lid of the corridor in relationship to the continuity of  
the fire partitions. Examples of appropriate corridor fire-resistance-rated construction are  
illustrated in the discussion of Section 708.  
In a fully sprinklered building, a corridor must be fire-resistance rated only in Groups H, R, I-  
1, and I-3. In Groups H-1, H-2, H-3, I-1, and I-3, the protection is required regardless of the  
occupant load served by the corridor. Where a corridor serves an occupant load of more than 10  
in a sprinklered Group R occupancy, it must have a minimum ½-hour rating. A minimum 1-hour  
rating is required for R-3 or R-4 occupancies which use an NFPA 13D sprinkler system. Where a  
corridor serves an occupant load of more than 30 in a Group H-4 or H-5 occupancy, the walls of  
the corridors are required to be of not less than 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction.  
In buildings not equipped with an automatic sprinkler system throughout, corridors are  
required to be fire-resistance rated in all occupancies, based on the occupant load served. When a  
corridor serves an occupant load greater than 30 in a Group A, B, E, F, M, S, or U occupancy, or  
any occupant load in a Group I-4, 1-hour fire-resistance-rated corridor walls are required. Where  
the occupant load reaches the levels specified, it is appropriate to afford those persons in the  
means of egress corridor some additional protection from potential fire occurring in the enclosed  
spaces bordering the corridor. Therefore, a minimum separation for the corridor of 1-hour fire  
resistance is deemed necessary.  
Fire-resistance-rated corridor exceptions. A series of exceptions to the 1-hour corridor  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrequirement addresses a number of special circumstances where it is felt that the fire-resistance-  
rated separation is not necessary. The first applies to corridors in Group E occupancies. Such  
corridors need not comply with the 1-hour fire-resistance requirement when\:  
1\. Every classroom that the corridor serves has at least one egress door leading directly to  
the outside at ground level, and  
2\. Rooms that are served by the corridor and are used for assembly purposes have at least  
one-half of their required egress doors leading directly to the outside at ground level.  
Exception 2 exempts corridors within dwelling units or sleeping units of Group I-1 and Group  
R occupancies from the fire-resistance rating. Exceptions 3 and 4 indicate that fire-resistance-  
rated corridors are not required in open parking garages, nor are they required in spaces of Group  
B occupancies requiring only a single means of egress. Exception 5 is an extension of the  
exception to Section 708.5 recognizing that corridor walls that are also exterior walls need to  
comply only with the wall and opening requirements of Section 705.  
1020.3 Width and capacity. The minimum required width and capacity of a corridor is  
regulated like any other component of the means of egress. The required capacity \(calculated  
width\), determined by Section 1005.3.2, must be compared with the minimum \(component\)  
width, which in this case is established in Table 1020.3. The greater of the two required widths  
must be available for egress purposes.  
For component width purposes, a corridor is required to be at least 44 inches \(1,118 mm\) in  
width. A number of conditions reduce or increase this minimum width to the following  
dimensions\:  
1\. Twenty-four inches \(610 mm\) is permitted in those nonpublic areas where access is  
necessary to service or use electrical, mechanical, or plumbing systems or equipment.  
These areas are seldom occupied, and then typically only by a single occupant.  
2\. Thirty-six inches \(914 mm\) is adequate where the corridor serves as a means of egress for  
49 occupants or fewer, or where the corridor is located in a dwelling unit. Small occupant  
loads can easily egress through corridors of this minimum width. It also allows adequate  
width for circulation purposes and the movement of furnishings and equipment.  
3\. Seventy-two inches \(1,829 mm\) is the minimum width required for school corridors  
serving at least 100 students and for corridors in ambulatory care facilities where the  
movement of stretchers is anticipated. The increased width for Group E occupancies  
provides for better circulation during peak usage, whereas the increase in surgical areas  
allows the limited movement of nonambulatory patients and equipment.  
4\. Ninety-six inches \(2,438 mm\) is required in Group I-2 occupancies for the movement of  
patients in standard hospital beds. This width is necessary to safely accommodate this  
kind of use. An exception exempts those areas used as a part of a defend-in-place strategy.  
As stated, this section provides for the minimum required widths and capacities of corridors.  
The code is not totally clear on how the required corridor width is determined when the occupant  
load is large enough to require corridor widths in excess of these minimums. A common  
approach to determining the required minimum widths of corridors is that the width should be  
related to the required capacity of the exit to which the corridor leads. The most logical  
procedure for determining corridor widths is to determine the required capacity of the exits at the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationend of the corridor and to size the corridor to provide that same minimum width. See Figure  
1020-1\. The controlling concept is to mutually equate the required capacity of the corridors and  
the required capacity of the exits that the corridor serves. However, the minimum required width  
of 44 inches \(1,118 mm\) must be maintained for the corridor unless an exception is applicable.  
1020.5 Dead ends. This section establishes the limitations on dead-end corridors. Basically,  
wherever more than one exit or exit access doorway is required, the exit access shall be arranged  
so that occupants can travel in either direction from any point to a separate exit. However, dead  
ends in corridors are permitted up to a maximum length of 20 feet \(6,096 mm\), as illustrated in  
Figure 1020-2. In the event that the conditions of building occupancy permit access to only a  
single exit, the dead-end limit does not apply. When the basic requirement is for travel in only a  
single direction to one exit, travel in the opposite direction is not considered to be in violation of  
the dead-end requirements. However, the maximum distance of travel will be regulated by the  
common path provisions of Section 1006.2.1.  
Two exceptions permit dead ends of a length up to 50 feet \(15,240 mm\). In Group I-3  
occupancies where free movement is allowed to some degree \(Condition 2, 3, or 4\), and in low-  
hazard and moderate-hazard occupancies housed in fully sprinklered buildings, the increased  
length of the dead-end condition has been found to be acceptable. Exception 3 permits a dead  
end of unlimited length, provided that such length of the dead-end corridor does not exceed two-  
and one-half times the least width of the dead-end portion of the corridor. See Figure 1020-3.  
The fourth exception allows a 30-foot \(9,144 mm\) dead end in portions of hospital corridors that  
do not serve patient rooms or treatment spaces. These areas tend to be similar to business or  
other moderate-hazard occupancies and therefore a longer dead-end will not impact the patient  
safety.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1020-1 Corridor capacity example.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1020-2 Dead-end corridors.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1020-3 Dead-end limits.  
The limitation on dead ends is directed toward avoiding portions of the corridor system that  
could result in entrapment of the building occupant by creating a situation where the building  
occupant, following a proper path of travel through the means of egress system, might, under fire  
conditions, take a wrong turn into a portion of the system from which there is no outlet. In such a  
situation, it is possible that the building occupant will have to proceed all the way to the end of  
the dead end before learning that there is no way out and, thereafter, will have to retrace steps to  
arrive at an exit.  
1020.6 Air movement in corridors. Corridors are not to be used as a portion of the heating,  
ventilating, and air-conditioning system by serving as plenums or ducts. They also may not be  
used for relief or exhaust venting purposes. As corridors are relied on to be an important  
component of the egress system, it is not appropriate to provide potential avenues for the spread  
of smoke and gases. It should be noted that this entire air movement provision is applicable to all  
corridors, not just those that are required to be fire-resistance rated. However, there appears to be  
inconsistency in the code insofar as adjoining spaces are permitted to be open to a nonrated  
corridor. Where a lack of physical separation occurs between the corridor and surrounding  
spaces, how can air be prevented from moving between them? In application, the provision  
merely is intended to require that those spaces open to the corridor be mechanically designed  
independent of the corridor \(supply, return, exhaust, and make-up air\) and not rely on the  
corridor to move air to or from the space. Exceptions to the general restriction are provided  
where the corridor is a source of make-up air for exhaust systems in adjacent spaces, a corridor  
in a dwelling unit, and a corridor within a tenant space not exceeding 1,000 square feet \(93 m2\) in  
area. The final exception addresses the fact that several locations within a healthcare facility  
require either a positive or negative pressure relative to other spaces and thus a certain amount of  
transfer air is needed to maintain the pressure difference.  
1020.7 Corridor continuity. It is required that fire-resistance-rated corridors should not be  
interrupted by intervening rooms, and that they be continuous to the exits. This provision carries  
out the basic concept, which states that once a building occupant progresses to a certain level of  
safety—in this case, the safety afforded by a fire-resistance-rated corridor—that level of safety is  
not thereafter reduced as the building occupant proceeds through the remainder of the means of  
egress. Therefore, the building occupant, having once reached such a corridor, is not thereafter  
brought out of the corridor and introduced into another occupied use space of the building; the  
corridor must be continuous. However, the code emphasizes that it is possible to permit fire-  
resistance-rated corridors to be conducted through foyers, lobbies, and reception rooms. These  
are not to be considered intervening spaces as long as they are constructed in accordance with the  
requirements for the corridor they serve. See Figure 1020-4. The code is silent regarding the  
maximum size or permitted uses for a lobby or reception room. An extreme example would be  
the lobby of a large hotel. It is not uncommon to see seating areas, piano bars, breakfast buffets,  
and similar occupiable areas open to the fire-resistance-rated corridor. The building official must  
evaluate the appropriateness of all areas open to the extended corridor. It would be desirable for  
exiting purposes to provide all direct egress from fire-resistance-rated corridors; however,  
lobbies, foyers, and reception areas are an accepted entrance element that must be considered.  
Corridor continuity must also be considered where egress within the fire-resistance-rated corridor  
system includes vertical travel. A fire-resistance-rated corridor may extend to include two stories  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwhere the travel is maintained within a fire-resistance-rated corridor enclosure at both stories and  
at the exit access stairway connecting the corridors on both stories. The key is that the fire-  
resistive continuity is maintained continuously throughout the enclosure that extends to include  
the two interconnected stories.  
Figure 1020-4 Corridor continuity.  
Section 1021 Egress Balconies  
Balconies used for egress purposes are similar in many ways to corridors and, as such, are  
required to meet the corridor provisions addressing width and capacity, headroom, dead ends,  
and projections.  
1021.2 Wall separation. Because there is a potential exposure to a fire condition for occupants  
using an exterior egress balcony during evacuation of a building, a minimum level of fire  
protection is mandated. This section requires that the balcony be separated from the interior of  
the building in a manner consistent with the separation requirements for corridors. However,  
where two stairs serve the egress balcony, and travel from a dead-end condition to a stair does  
not occur past an unprotected opening, the separation is not required.  
1021.3 Openness. One of the features of any egress balcony is its openness to the atmosphere,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationlimiting the amount of smoke and toxic-gas accumulation. To qualify as part of the exit system,  
the balcony must be at least 50 percent open on the long side. It is also necessary that the open  
areas above the guardrail be distributed to allow for adequate natural ventilation.  
1021.4 Location. Because of exposure potential from adjacent property, exterior balconies are  
prohibited within 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) of an adjacent lot line. Such components must also  
maintain a minimum 10-foot \(3,048-mm\) separation from other buildings on the same lot unless  
the exterior walls and openings of the adjacent building are protected in accordance with Section  
705 based on fire separation distance. See Figure 1021-1.  
Figure 1021-1 Egress balconies and stairways.  
Section 1022 Exits  
Exits constitute those portions of the means of egress where the occupant first achieves a  
significant level of fire protection. An exit is expected to provide a mandated level of protection,  
and that level cannot be reduced until arrival at the exit discharge. Travel within exits is not  
limited and is typically single directional. Therefore, care is taken to ensure that the exit  
component is available for use by the building occupant during a fire or other emergency. This  
section makes it clear that the primary function of an exit component is to provide egress, and  
any other use cannot interfere with that function.  
1022.2 Exterior exit doors. Once the provisions of Section 1010 for doors have been reviewed,  
there are relatively few exterior exit door requirements remaining to address. It should be noted  
that at least one exterior door that meets the size requirements of Section 1010.1.1 must be  
provided for every building used for human occupancy.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 1023 Interior Exit Stairways and Ramps  
1023.1 General. The interior exit stairways and interior exit ramps addressed in this section are  
considered as exit components within a means of egress. As such, they must provide a prescribed  
degree of fire resistance in order to protect occupants traveling through the system. In addition,  
interior exit stairways must provide direct travel to the exterior unless interrupted or extended by  
exit passageways complying with Section 1024. Travel within an exit passageway is considered  
equivalent to travel within an interior exit stairway or ramp. Due to the importance of an interior  
exit stairway as an element of the means of egress, it is critical that the stairway enclosure be  
used for no purpose that would lessen its integrity as an exit component. The presence of  
equipment, furnishings, stored items, and other obstructions within the stairway system is strictly  
prohibited.  
1023.2 Construction. Consistent with the provisions addressing the enclosure of vertical  
openings with shaft enclosures as set forth in Section 713, all vertical openings for every interior  
stairway or ramp must be similarly enclosed within fire-resistance-rated construction. Because  
vertical openings provide the most readily available paths for fire spreading upward from floor to  
floor through buildings, it is extremely important that such openings be adequately enclosed.  
This enclosure is also required in order to protect and separate the vertical exitway from potential  
fire and products of combustion in other spaces of the building to allow for a usable egress path.  
Other than where the Group I-3 special provisions of Section 408.3.8, the atrium criteria of  
Section 404.6 are applied, there are no exceptions to the fire-resistance-rated enclosure  
provisions of this section. Unenclosed stairways and ramps are permitted, but only under the  
limitations established in Section 1019 for exit access stairways and ramps.  
The degree of fire resistance required for enclosures for interior exit stairways and ramps is  
dependent on the number of stories connected by the stairways. Where four or more stories are  
connected, the enclosing construction must be at least 2-hour fire-resistance-rated construction.  
In all other instances, required enclosures of interior exit stairways and ramps must be a  
minimum of 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction. For the determination of the required fire  
resistance of the enclosure, the number of stories also includes any basements that may exist  
within the building, but not mezzanines. The only exception to these general rating requirements  
is found in Exception 3, which references the specialized construction requirements for podium  
buildings in Item 4 of Section 510.2.  
The fire-resistance rating of the enclosure for an interior exit stairway or ramp is also  
regulated in a manner consistent with shaft enclosures in regard to the rating of the floor\(s\) being  
penetrated by the enclosure. Where the floor construction penetrated by the enclosure has a fire-  
resistance rating, the enclosure must have the same minimum rating. For example, an interior  
exit stairway enclosure that penetrates a 2-hour floor assembly must have a minimum fire-  
resistance rating of 2 hours, regardless of the number of stories the enclosure connects. The fire-  
resistance rating of an interior exit stairway or ramp enclosure need never exceed 2 hours. If the  
floor assembly penetrated requires a minimum 3-hour fire-resistance rating, the enclosure rating  
is only required to be 2-hour fire-resistance rated.  
1023.4 Openings. Because enclosures for interior exit stairways and ramps are so fundamental  
to the safety of building occupants and their ability to safely exit a multistory building during a  
fire emergency, the code is careful to protect the integrity of these vertical enclosures in every  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationway possible. In addition to the fire-resistance-rated construction required of the enclosure, the  
openings that are permitted to penetrate the fire-resistant enclosure are narrowly limited. This  
section very clearly establishes that only those openings necessary to provide exit facilities for  
occupants of the building spaces and allowed openings in the exterior walls are permitted.  
Because the exterior walls of an interior exit stairway or ramp enclosure are not protecting the  
exit from other building spaces, openings through the exterior wall into the atmosphere are  
permitted. In fact, in buildings that are located on the lot so that there would be no requirement  
for the fire-resistance-rated construction of the exterior wall or for the protection of the openings  
in such walls, the exterior wall of an enclosure could be eliminated entirely. However, such  
openings must comply with the proper requirements of the code relating to the location of those  
openings with respect to lot lines or to other potential exterior fire exposures.  
This provision also makes it clear that it is the intent of the code to prohibit openings from  
typically unoccupied spaces directly into the interior exit stairway or ramp enclosure. Therefore,  
it is not permitted to provide openings from such spaces as store rooms, toilet rooms, equipment  
rooms, machinery rooms, electrical rooms, and similar rooms directly into the enclosure. In  
addition, elevators are specifically prohibited from opening into an enclosure for interior exit  
stairways and ramps.  
Where openings for exit doorways are provided, it is necessary that they be protected with a  
fire-rated assembly. Fire-door assemblies and other opening protectives permitted under this  
section are addressed in Section 716. Where an exit passageway is used as an extension to the  
exterior of the interior exit stairway or ramp enclosure, Section 1023.3.1 indicates that a fire  
separation with a fire door assembly is required to separate the vertical enclosure from the exit  
passageway. Such a fire door assembly shall have a fire-protective rating in accordance with  
Section 716.2.  
However, the entire fire separation is not required where there are no openings into the exit  
passageway extension as illustrated in Figure 1023-1 or where both the stairway enclosure and  
the exit passageway are pressurized.  
1023.5 Penetrations. Penetrations into an interior exit stairway or ramp are prohibited unless  
necessary to service or protect the exit component. Acceptable penetrations include fire  
protection systems, security systems, two-way communication systems, electrical conduits  
serving the stairway or ramp enclosure and structural elements supporting the stair or the  
enclosure. All such penetrations shall be made in a manner that will maintain the structural and  
fire-resistance integrity of the enclosure. Under no circumstances shall there be communicating  
openings or penetrations between adjacent interior exit stairways. The exception permits  
complying membrane penetrations, but only on the outside of the enclosure. There is no limit on  
the type or purpose of the penetration other than limiting the location to the exterior membrane  
and requiring the proper protection.  
1023.6 Ventilation. Equipment and ductwork necessary for independent pressurization of an  
enclosure for an interior exit stairway or ramp is permitted under specific conditions. Where  
ventilation of the enclosure is desired, the ventilation systems shall be independent and isolated  
from the other building ventilation systems. There are three methods set forth to regulate the  
installation of the ventilation equipment and ductwork. The equipment and ductwork may be  
located at the exterior of the building, within the enclosure, or within the building. In all cases,  
the provisions of Section 713 for shaft enclosures will regulate the separation of the equipment  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand ductwork from the remainder of the building.  
Figure 1023-1 Extent of enclosure.  
1023.7 Interior exit stairway and ramp exterior walls. Whenever a stairway or ramp is  
installed as a component in an exiting system, it is important to protect the stair or ramp user  
from potential exposure to any fire that might occur in the building. Therefore, where exterior  
walls of interior exit stairway and ramp enclosures are nonrated and openings in such walls are  
unprotected, the location and protection of adjacent portions of the building must be considered.  
Only those walls and openings within 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) horizontally and located at an angle  
less than 180 degrees \(3.14 rad\) from the enclosure walls need to be protected. Such walls shall  
have a minimum fire-resistance rating of 1 hour and any openings shall be protected at least ¾  
hour. The extent of the protected construction shall be from the ground to a point at least 10 feet  
\(3,048 mm\) above the topmost landing of the stairway or ramp, or to the roof line if it is lower  
than 10 feet \(3,048 mm\). An example of this provision is shown in Figure 1023-2. In all cases,  
the exterior walls of the enclosure must comply with the provisions of Section 705 based on fire  
separation distance.  
This provision is based on the enclosure exterior walls being of nonrated construction with  
any openings left unprotected. Because the main issue is to protect the egress path, any adjacent  
building construction that would present an exposure hazard to occupants using the stair or ramp  
enclosure must be fire-resistance-rated construction. On the other hand, the enclosure walls and  
openings could be fully protected on all sides, including those on the exterior of the building,  
under the provisions of Section 1023.2 and, therefore, the requirements of this section would not  
be applicable. Whether the protection is at the enclosure or at the location of the hazard is  
ultimately immaterial.  
1023.8 Barrier at level of exit discharge. The barrier required by this section is intended to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprevent persons from accidentally continuing into the basement. The term “barrier” is used rather  
than “gate” or “door” to indicate this is a performance provision. The design and location details  
of the barrier must be approved by the building official. Directional exit signs as specified in  
Section 1013 are also required, in addition to the physical barrier.  
Figure 1023-2 Interior exit stairway exterior walls.  
1023.9 Stairway identification signs. This section specifies a system whereby any persons,  
particularly fire fighters, inside an interior exit stairway or ramp enclosure in a building will be  
provided with information telling them where they are in the building and where the stairway or  
ramp leads to both above and below that point. This required sign can be critically important for  
fire-fighting purposes and is frequently useful to other building occupants. Enclosures  
connecting three stories or fewer are exempt from the identification requirements.  
As set forth in this provision, this sign is to be positioned not less than 5 feet \(1,524 mm\)  
above the floor landing in such a manner that it is readily visible whether the door is open or  
shut. Information to be provided on the sign includes\:  
1\. The floor level.  
2\. 3. The top terminus of the enclosure.  
The bottom terminus of the enclosure.  
4\. 5. 6. 7. The identification or location of the stairway or ramp.  
The story of exit discharge.  
The direction of exit discharge.  
The availability of roof access from the stairway.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1023-3 Typical stairway floor number sign.  
A sample sign complying with these requirements is shown in Figure 1023-3.  
1023.11 Tactile floor-level signs. In addition to other signage, a sign indicating the floor level is  
required inside the stairway on the landing adjacent to the door. This sign is intended to provide  
information and way-finding for persons with visual disabilities. Therefore, the sign must have  
the floor level indicated in visual characters, raised characters, and braille. The sign required by  
this section is different than the exit sign required by Section 1013.4.  
1023.12 Smokeproof enclosures. Under certain conditions of building occupancy, protection of  
the vertical exitways over and above that required in the more usual situations is warranted. In  
such situations, it is necessary that the vertical exitway be constructed not only with a vertical  
enclosure, but also with either an outside balcony, by a ventilated vestibule, or by pressurization  
meeting the requirements of Section 909.20. A smokeproof enclosure is a special arrangement of  
the vertical exitway to minimize, if not prevent, the infiltration of smoke and other products of  
combustion into the actual stairway. Therefore, a smokeproof enclosure is one where the  
building occupant does not enter the stair enclosure directly from the occupied space of the  
building, unless the stairway enclosure pressurization alternative addressed in Section 909.20.5 is  
used.  
Only those buildings regulated by Section 403 \(high-rise buildings\), or Section 405  
\(underground buildings\), or Section 412.2 \(airport traffic control towers\) are required to use  
smokeproof enclosures in their means of egress. For high-rise buildings, it is required that all  
exits in such buildings be smokeproof enclosures or pressurized stairways for each of the exits  
that serve stories where the floor surface is located more than 75 feet \(22,860 mm\) above the  
level of fire-department vehicle access. For underground buildings, they are required where at  
least one floor is more than 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) below the level of exit discharge serving such  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfloor levels. Details of the various features of smokeproof enclosures are found in the discussion  
of Section 909.20.  
Where a smokeproof enclosure or pressurized stairway reaches the level of exit discharge, it is  
to exit directly to a public way or to a yard or open space providing access to a public way. As an  
option, egress is permitted to travel through areas on the level of exit discharge if the conditions  
of Exception 1 or 2 of Section 1028.2 are met. Where the enclosure is not located at the exterior  
wall, an exit passageway may be used to maintain the protection of the exitway. The exit  
passageway must be of 2-hour fire-resistance-rated construction and have no openings that could  
adversely affect the integrity of the enclosure. As previously mentioned, the access to a stairway  
within a smokeproof enclosure must be made through a vestibule or an open exterior balcony.  
The one exception is the use of a pressurized system complying with the provisions of Section  
909.20.5.  
Section 1024 Exit Passageways  
In many ways, the role of an exit passageway is identical to that of an interior exit stairway \(or  
ramp\). Therefore, the provisions regulating exit passageways are very similar to those governing  
interior exit stairways. The code specifies that both components are not to be used for any  
purpose other than as a means of egress. Once a building occupant is inside an exit passageway  
or an interior exit stairway, there is no subsequent limitation on travel distance. In most  
instances, the exit component must be continuous to the exit discharge or a public way.  
The width and capacity of an exit passageway are regulated in the same manner as for a  
corridor. Those passageways serving an occupant load of less than 50 are permitted to have a  
minimum width of 36 inches \(914 mm\). Where the occupant load is 50 or more, such a width  
must be at least 44 inches \(1,118 mm\) based on the required capacity. In no case, however, shall  
the width be less than that determined by calculation in Section 1005.3.2. Other than the  
permitted projections for doors, trim, and similar decorative features, the required capacity and  
minimum width of exit passageways are to be clear and unobstructed.  
A minimum 1-hour fire-resistance rating is required for the walls, floors, and ceilings  
enclosing exit passageways. Where the exit passageway is provided as an extension of an interior  
exit stairway, the required fire-resistance rating of the exit passageway shall not be less than that  
required for the connecting interior exit stairway. For example, an exit passageway serving as a  
horizontal extension of stairway travel in a 2-hour fire-resistance-rated interior exit stairway  
must also be 2-hour enclosed.  
Openings and penetrations that occur in the enclosure elements of an exit passageway are  
strictly controlled. In fact, the limitations are consistent with provisions regulating openings into  
and penetrations through interior exit stairways. See the discussion of Sections 1023.4 and  
1023.5 for an analysis of the provisions that are applicable to both exit passageways and interior  
exit stairways.  
Uses of exit passageways. Exit passageways are commonly used in several different exiting  
situations. In many cases, it is required that interior stairways be enclosed and that the enclosure  
extend completely to the exterior of the building, including, if necessary, an exit passageway on  
the floor of the level of exit discharge. When used in this configuration, the exit passageway  
assumes the same fire-protection requirements as for the stairway enclosure it serves. An exit  
passageway is also required to maintain the protective continuity of an interior exit stairway at  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationhorizontal travel above the discharge level. Where travel on a story is required from the  
termination point of one interior exit stairway to the entrance to another interior exit stairway in  
order to provide a continuous exit path, the connecting element must be an exit passageway.  
An ongoing use of exit passageways is in connection with covered mall buildings. An  
example of the use of exit passageways in covered mall buildings results from the fact that travel  
distance in the mall is limited to a maximum of 200 feet \(60,960 mm\). It will occasionally be  
necessary between major exits from the mall to introduce an exit passageway or provide an  
additional exit to satisfy the requirements limiting travel distance. By the use of such exit  
passageways, it is possible to locate the main entrance/exit points to the mall building at  
substantially greater intervals. In addition, the use of an exit passageway can potentially  
eliminate dead-end conditions that occur where back-of-tenant egress is provided along the same  
path as mall egress.  
A historic use of exit passageways is in buildings that have very large floor areas. In such  
buildings, it is sometimes not possible to get the building occupants to the exits at the building’s  
perimeter within the limitations of the permitted travel distance. Therefore, an exit passageway is  
used to literally bring the exit to the interior of the spaces and to the building occupant so that it  
is possible for any building occupant to reach and enter the exit passageway within the permitted  
travel distance. This type of exit passageway is frequently accomplished by constructing, in  
effect, a special type of fire-resistive corridor. It can also be accomplished by constructing either  
an overhead, fire-resistant, enclosed passageway, or a tunnel. By these latter means, it is possible  
to avoid manufacturing processes and other functions at the floor level within the building.  
Another use of exit passageways occurs when a separation of multiple exit doors is  
insufficient. By extending the points of egress through the use of one or more exit passageways,  
it is possible to relocate the exit doors to the point where they comply with Section 1007.1. The  
exit separation distance would then be measured in a straight line between the exit doors, which  
could each enter into an exit passageway.  
Again, it should be noted that once in an exit passageway, the building occupant is considered  
to be in a relatively safe location and travel distances within the exit passageway are not limited,  
just as travel distances within interior exit stairways are not limited.  
In most cases, the primary difference between an exit passageway and an exit corridor lie in  
their respective requirements for opening protection and the fact that the passageway requires a  
complete enclosure, including ceiling and floor, of at least 1-hour fire-resistance-rated  
construction. Permitted openings and penetrations in exit passageways are also much more  
limited than what is allowed into a corridor.  
Section 1025 Luminous Egress Path Markings  
Improving the visibility of stair treads and handrails under normal and emergency conditions is a  
significant factor in raising the level of occupant safety for individuals negotiating stairs during  
egress of a high-rise building. A second source of emergency power for exit illumination, exit  
signs, and stair shaft pressurization systems in smokeproof enclosures is mandated for high-rise  
buildings. In the event of an emergency that disconnects utility power, the emergency power  
source should engage, causing the stair shaft to be illuminated and maintained smoke-free by the  
pressurization system. Unfortunately, such systems can fail under demand conditions. The  
mandate for luminous egress path markings adds an additional level of safety to the egress  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationactivity. The installation of photoluminescent or self-illuminating marking systems that do not  
require electrical power and its associated wiring and circuits provide an additional means for  
ensuring that occupants can safely egress a building via exit stairs, even if the emergency power  
supply and system fails to operate.  
The use of photoluminescent or self-illuminating materials to delineate the exit path is  
required in Group A, B, E, I-1, M, and R-1 occupancies having occupied floors more than 75 feet  
\(22,860 mm\) above the lowest level of fire-department vehicle access. In such high-rise  
buildings, the required use of these markings is limited to interior exit stairways and ramps, as  
well as exit passageways. The selected materials must meet the requirements of UL 1994,  
Luminous Egress Path-Marking Systems, or ASTM E2072, Standard Specification for  
Photoluminescent \(Phosphorescent\) Safety Markings.  
All markings are required to be solid and continuous stripes. A key requirement for marking  
systems is that their design must be uniform. The placement and dimensions of markings shall be  
consistent throughout the same stairway or ramp enclosure. By specifying standard marking  
dimensions, the requirements ensure that the marking is visible during dark conditions and  
provides consistent and standard application in the design and enforcement of exit path  
markings. Markings installed on stair steps, perimeter demarcation lines, and handrails must  
have a minimum width of 1 inch \(25 mm\). For stair steps and perimeter demarcation lines, their  
maximum width cannot exceed 2 inches \(51 mm\). The provisions for stair steps, perimeter  
demarcation lines, and handrails allow the width of the marking to be reduced to less than 1 inch  
\(25 mm\) when marking stripes are listed in accordance with UL 1994.  
Markings are required along the entire length of the leading edge of each stair step and along  
the leading edge of stair landings. Markings are also required along the perimeter of stair  
landings and other floor areas within the enclosure. These demarcation lines serve to identify the  
transition from the stair steps to the landing, which is important to minimize the risk of a fall  
inside of a stairway or ramp enclosure that is not illuminated. In order to discern the transition  
from the stair to the floor, the demarcation line is located either across the bottom of the door or  
on the floor in front of the door.  
Selected materials used in the construction of the luminous egress path markings must comply  
with either UL 1994 or ASTM E2072. ASTM E2072 allows the use of paints and coatings,  
which can be useful because it avoids a potential tripping hazard, especially in locations where  
the surface substrate may not be even. The luminescence of the selected marking system must  
provide an illumination of at least 1 foot-candle \(11 lux\), which is consistent with the  
requirement in IBC Section 1008.2.1 for the general illumination of walking surfaces. This  
degree of illumination must be provided for at least 60 minutes.  
Analogous to rechargeable batteries, many photoluminescent and self-illuminating egress path  
markings require exposure to light to perform properly. Thus, photoluminescent egress path  
markings must be exposed to a minimum 1-foot candle \(11 lux\) of light energy at the walking  
surface for at least 60 minutes prior to the building being occupied. The charging rate for  
photoluminescent egress path markings is based on the wattage of lamps used to provide egress  
path illumination. Therefore, it is important to verify that the specified lamps have sufficient  
wattage to meet the required illumination levels.  
Section 1026 Horizontal Exits  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe horizontal exit may well be the least understood and most under-used component in the  
means of egress. It can be a very effective method for providing adequate required exiting  
capacity while at the same time realizing some very substantial construction cost and space  
savings.  
A horizontal exit consists essentially of separating a story into portions by dividing it with  
construction having a fire-resistance rating. The construction of one or more horizontal exit walls  
divides the floor into multiple compartments. The concept of the horizontal exit is to permit each  
of these fire compartments to serve as a refuge area for occupants in one or more of the fire  
compartments in the event of a fire emergency. Building occupants in the compartment of fire  
origin may then pass through the fire-resistance-rated horizontal exit into the compartment of  
refuge, thereby gaining sufficient protection and sufficient time for either the extinguishment of  
the fire and elimination of the fire threat, or the orderly use of the remaining exits from the  
compartment serving as the refuge area.  
The horizontal exit is used effectively in hospitals, as well as in detention and correctional  
facilities, where total evacuation from the building may present numerous physical and other  
problems. If in a health-care facility it is necessary to move patients from their rooms in a fire  
emergency, it is desirable to avoid the need for moving them vertically by stairs. Therefore, if an  
arrangement can be provided whereby patients would only be subject to horizontal movement,  
the safety of the building occupant can be far more easily achieved. Although horizontal exits are  
most frequently used only where the more traditional forms of egress design are not satisfactory,  
they can often be used quite effectively in many situations. In fact, in those instances where fire  
walls having a fire-resistance rating of not less than 2 hours are provided, the resulting  
arrangement is often tailor-made for use as a horizontal exit. However, fire walls are not required  
to be viewed as creating a horizontal exit. The use of a fire wall as a horizontal exit is a design  
decision, and compliance with all aspects of Section 1026 would be needed before it is accepted  
as a compliant exit.  
1026.1 General. When properly constructed, a horizontal exit may serve as a required exit. It  
may, in fact, be substituted on a one-for-one basis for other types of exits. However, in only very  
limited situations may horizontal exits be used as the only exit from a portion of a building, or to  
provide more than one-half the total required number, width, and capacity of exits from any  
building space. See Figure 1026-1 for the general rule. In a Group I-2 occupancy, horizontal  
exits may comprise up to two-thirds of the required exits from any building or floor area, and  
Group I-3 occupancies may use horizontal exits for 100 percent of the required egress.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1026-1 Horizontal exits.  
In the design of a horizontal exit system, it must be emphasized that it is not necessary to  
accumulate the total occupant load of the two compartments and then provide exit capacity for  
that total occupant load from each of the compartments. Were that the case, the horizontal exit  
would often provide little or no benefit. In designing a horizontal exit arrangement, one simply  
treats the separate compartments as if they were, in fact, separate buildings. Each compartment is  
provided with an exit system that is in compliance with all of the various criteria for a total exit  
system from a building. The main difference is that in this configuration, one of the exits from  
the separate compartments is a horizontal exit into the compartment of refuge. Figure 1026-2  
depicts possible arrangements for horizontal exits.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1026-2 Horizontal exit uses.  
1026.2 Separation. As previously mentioned, a fire barrier and a fire wall are the only two  
construction methods acceptable for the separation provided by a horizontal exit. In both cases, a  
minimum fire-resistance rating of 2 hours is required. A fire wall provides a natural horizontal  
exit. For a fire barrier, acting as a horizontal exit, to completely divide a floor of a building into  
two or more separate refuge areas, the fire barrier walls must be continuous from exterior wall to  
exterior wall. In addition, a fire barrier used as the horizontal exit must extend vertically through  
all levels of the building, unless 2-hour fire-resistance-rated floor assemblies are provided with  
no unprotected openings. This method of isolation affords safety in the refuge area from fire and  
smoke in the area of incident origin.  
1026.3 Opening protectives. Openings through a horizontal exit are required to be protected,  
and thus they must have a fire-protection rating, consistent with the fire-resistance rating of the  
wall, as required by Section 716. Where installed through a horizontal exit wall, door openings  
must be self-closing, or smoke-detector-actuated automatic-closing assemblies must be installed  
in accordance with Section 716.2.6.6. In fact, when a horizontal exit is installed across a  
corridor, or when a corridor terminates at a horizontal exit, smoke-detector-actuated automatic-  
closing assemblies must be used. As is the case with any exit door, doors in horizontal exits must  
swing in the direction of exit travel when serving an occupant load of 50 or more, as provided in  
Section 1010.1.2.1. When the horizontal exit is to be used for exiting in both directions, it will  
often be necessary to provide separate exit doors for the separate directions to satisfy this  
requirement. Most likely, this will require the use of one or more pairs of opposite-swinging  
doors. See Figure 1026-3.  
1026.4 Refuge area. The area of refuge in a horizontal exit configuration must be sized to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprovide sufficient space for the original occupant load of the compartment of refuge plus an  
anticipated occupant load from the fire compartment for a limited period of time. The occupant  
load assigned from the fire compartment is determined by calculating the capacity of the  
horizontal exit doors that enter the area of refuge or the fire compartments design occupant load  
and using the smaller of the two. It is necessary for building occupants to remain in the area of  
refuge only long enough to permit the extinguishment of the fire and elimination of the fire  
threat, or to allow the combined occupant load of the two compartments to use the remaining exit  
facilities from the compartment of refuge.  
Figure 1026-3 Opposite-swinging doors.  
To reasonably accommodate the combined occupant loads in the compartment of refuge, the  
code requires that at least 3 square feet \(0.28 m2\) of net clear floor area be provided for each  
occupant. Where the horizontal exit also serves to form a smoke compartment in a Group I-1, I-  
2, I-3, or a Group B ambulatory care facility, then additional refuge size requirements apply. The  
references ensure the refuge area is capable of accommodating the increased sizes needed for  
care recipients in beds, stretchers, or with extra equipment. For example in a Group I-2  
occupancy, an area of 30 square feet \(2.8 m2\) is needed for each patient in a bed or stretcher,  
while 6 square feet \(0.56 m2\) is needed for ambulatory patients who are not in a bed or stretcher.  
An example of calculating refuge area capacity is illustrated in Application Example 1026-1.  
Although these area figures will permit a rather dense occupancy in the refuge area, it must be  
remembered that the occupancy of that space is only temporary and that the occupants of the  
refuge area will continue to evacuate the refuge area by use of the remaining exit or exits. In a  
fire emergency, such space per person is considered adequate for a short period of time.  
It is also important to provide such a required refuge area for occupants in spaces that will, in  
fact, be available to the occupants of the building as they enter the compartment of refuge. Such  
spaces can be provided in corridors, lobbies, and other public areas, as long as they are sufficient  
to accommodate the total occupant load at the appropriate rate of area per person. Spaces in the  
refuge area occupied by the same tenant as in the area of fire origin are also permitted.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1026-1  
Section 1027 Exterior Exit Stairways and Ramps  
1027.2 Use in a means of egress. An exterior exit stairway or ramp may serve as an exit  
component in the means of egress system in all occupancies other than Group I-2. The use of an  
exterior exit stairway or ramp as a required means of egress element is limited to non-high-rise  
buildings with a maximum of six stories above grade plane.  
1027.3 Open side. To be classified as an exterior stair, it must be open on at least one side. The  
open side must then adjoin open areas such as yards, courts, or public ways. In order to qualify  
as an open side, there must be at least 35 square feet \(3.3 m2\) of aggregate open area adjacent to  
each floor level and at the level of each intermediate landing. In addition, the required open area  
must be at least 42 inches \(1,067 mm\) above the adjacent floor or landing level. See Figure  
1027-1\. By limiting the amount of enclosure by the exterior walls of the building, an exterior  
stair will be sufficiently open to the exterior to prevent accumulation of smoke and toxic gases.  
Any stairway that does not comply with these criteria is considered an interior stairway.  
1027.5 Location. Because of exposure potential from adjacent property, exterior stairways and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationramps are prohibited within 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) of an adjacent lot line for other than individual  
units of Group R-3. Such components must also maintain a minimum 10-foot \(3,048-mm\)  
separation from other buildings on the same lot unless the exterior walls and openings of the  
adjacent building are protected in accordance with Section 705 based on fire separation distance.  
See Figure 1021-1.  
Figure 1027-1 Exterior exit stairways.  
1027.6 Exterior exit stairway and ramp protection. In order to adequately protect the building  
occupants as they travel an exterior stairway or ramp during egress, the exterior exit path must be  
adequately separated from the interior of the building. With exceptions, this section requires that  
an exterior stairway or ramp be separated from the interior of the building in the same manner  
and to the same degree as is provided by an interior exit stairway. See the discussion of Section  
1023.2\. Consistent with these provisions, openings are not permitted unless necessary for egress  
from normally occupied spaces to the exterior stair. Adjacent exterior walls must also be  
addressed where they expose the stairway or ramp. The provisions are consistent with those  
applied to interior exit stairways and ramps as set forth in Section 1023.7. There are four  
situations where the separation between the exterior exit ramp or stairs and the building’s interior  
is not required\:  
1\. In buildings no more than two stories above grade plane housing other than Group R-1  
and R-2 occupancies, separation is not required where the level of exit discharge is at the  
first story. In such a scenario, only one story of vertical exit travel would be required. This  
would limit the exposure to a degree that protection is deemed unnecessary and  
coordinates with the fact an unprotected exit access stairway could be used in an interior  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. condition.  
If an open exterior balcony provides access to at least two remote exterior stairways or  
other exits, the separation is not required. See Figure 1027-2. To be considered open, the  
balcony must be open to the exterior for at least 50 percent of its perimeter. This length  
must then be open vertically at least 50 percent of the wall height, with openings  
extending at least 7 feet \(2,134 mm\) above the balcony. Where the building occupant has  
an alternative choice of exit travel, the occupant is not forced to use the stairway or ramp  
adjacent to the hazard. Therefore, wall and opening protection is not required.  
Figure 1027-2 Exterior stairway protection.  
3\. An open-ended corridor is simply a corridor that is open to the outside at the exterior of  
the building, leading directly to an exterior stairway or ramp at each end with no  
intervening doors or enclosures at the exterior wall. Where open-ended corridors are used,  
such as in a breezeway design, the code identifies under what conditions the fire  
separation is not necessary between the building interior and the exterior stairway or  
ramp. First, the building, including the open-ended corridor and stairs, must be  
sprinklered throughout. Second, the corridor shall meet all of the corridor provisions of  
Section 1020. Third, the exterior stairways at the ends of the open-ended corridor are to  
comply with the general exterior exit stairway and ramp provisions of Section 1027.  
Fourth, exterior walls and permitted openings adjacent to the exterior exit stairway or  
ramp must be protected when required by Section 1023.7. Fifth, where a change in  
direction of more than 45 degrees \(0.79 rad\) occurs in the corridor, an exterior stairway,  
exterior ramp, or openings to the exterior shall be provided. The openings shall be such  
that the accumulation of smoke and toxic gases will be minimized, but in no case less than  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation4\. 35 square feet \(3.25 m2\) in area. See Figure 1027-3.  
Exterior stairways serving limited height individual Group R-3 dwelling units may also  
eliminate the separation. This exception coordinates with what is allowed for interior exit  
access stairways in Section 1019.3. An exterior stairway would present no greater hazard  
than the interior exit access stairway within the unit.  
Figure 1027-3 Open-ended corridor.  
Section 1028 Exit Discharge  
1028.2 Exit discharge. Exits are intended to discharge directly to the exterior of the building.  
Three exceptions permit the exit path to include a portion of the building beyond the exit  
component. An exception to the requirements for the continuity of interior exit stairways \(and  
ramps\) is permitted where a maximum of 50 percent of the exits pass through areas on the level  
of exit discharge. The path of travel to the exterior must be unobstructed and easily recognized.  
Sprinkler protection is required for the egress path between the termination of the interior exit  
stairway to the building’s exterior, as is fire-resistance-rated construction isolating any areas  
below the discharge level. See Figure 1028-1. Egress separation is also established where an exit  
access stairway is used as a part of the means of egress system. Effectively, all portions of the  
discharge level that provide access to the egress path must be sprinklered as well. A second  
exception permits egress from an interior exit stairway to enter a vestibule where limited to 50  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationpercent of the number and capacity of the total stairways provided. The vestibule must be  
separated from the areas below by fire-resistance-rated construction, must be limited in size and  
shape, cannot be used for purposes other than egress, and must lead directly to the exterior. A  
minimum degree of construction providing fire and smoke protection, through the use of a fire  
partition and complying openings, shall separate the vestibule from other portions of the level of  
exit discharge. See Figure 1028-2. Although it is acceptable to use both of these exceptions in the  
same building, their combined use cannot exceed 50 percent of the number and capacity of the  
required exits. Therefore, this limitation will typically permit only one of the exceptions to be  
applied. The third exception simply recognizes that horizontal exiting does not provide egress  
directly to the outside of a building.  
Figure 1028-2 Exit discharge through vestibule.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1028-1 Exit discharge through building.  
Exit discharge is prohibited from reentering a building to ensure that the user does not go  
back into any portion of the building once he or she has reached the exit discharge. This  
prohibition can be viewed as excluding the reentry into interior exit stairways and ramps, exit  
passageways, or any portion that would be considered a component of the exit.  
1028.4 Exit discharge components. The general concept of the exit discharge portion of the  
means of egress is that the components be sufficiently open to the exterior to prevent the  
accumulation of smoke and toxic gases. As occupants reach the exterior of the building at grade  
level, they expect to have arrived at a point of relative safety. Where adequate natural cross  
ventilation is available to disperse any smoke or gases that may be present, one of the major fire-  
and life-safety concerns is assumed to have been addressed. It is common that roofed areas be  
provided at the exterior side of exterior exit doors in order to provide weather protection and/or  
decoration. Such areas are typically considered as a portion of the exit discharge where they are  
adequately open on the sides to provide for adequate natural ventilation.  
Section 1029 Egress Courts  
An egress court is defined as any court or yard that provides access to a public way for one or  
more required exits. As such, the code requires that every egress court discharge into a public  
way. See Figure 1029-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1029-1 Egress courts.  
1029.2 Width or capacity. The minimum width and required capacity of an egress court are  
determined in a similar manner to that of a corridor. An egress court must provide at least 44  
inches \(1,118 mm\) of width in all occupancies except Groups R-3 and U, where the width may  
be reduced to 36 inches \(914 mm\). When egress courts are subject to use by a sufficiently large  
occupant load, the minimum width may be wider than 44 inches \(1,118 mm\) based upon the  
required capacity. Such a greater width would be determined in accordance with the applicable  
provisions of Section 1005.3.2 based on the occupant load served. In no event may the minimum  
width be less than the required capacity. As is the case for most other egress components, limited  
encroachments into the required width are permitted for doors and handrails. Whatever the  
required width of the egress court, there must be at least 7 feet \(2,134 mm\) of unobstructed  
headroom.  
1029.3 Construction and openings. Because an egress court is a component in a means of  
egress system, building occupants using that component must be afforded sufficient protection to  
reasonably ensure that they will reach the safety of the public way. Therefore, in other than a  
Group R-3 occupancy, any time an egress court serves an occupant load of 10 or more and is less  
than 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) in width, the walls of the exit court must be of 1-hour fire-resistance-  
rated construction for a minimum height of 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) above the floor of the court. By  
this means, a fire-resistant separation is maintained between the persons in the court and the  
occupied-use spaces of the building. Should any openings occur in the portion of the egress court  
wall required to be fire-resistance-rated construction, those openings must be protected by  
assemblies having a fire-protection rating of not less than ¾ hour. See Figure 1029-2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1029-2 Egress court construction.  
Section 1030 Assembly  
Because of the potential for large occupant loads in concentrated areas, assembly uses are  
regulated for egress a bit differently than other occupancies. This section addresses a variety of  
issues that are specific to buildings and portions of buildings that are used for assembly purposes,  
including exit capacity, aisle widths, and smoke-protected assembly seating. Although the  
provisions of this section do not apply to all assembly-type uses, they are applicable to most. The  
means of egress for any assembly room or space containing seats, tables, displays, shelving,  
equipment, fixtures, or similar elements must comply with this section.  
Section 1030 is applicable to assembly uses regardless of their occupancy classification.  
Although the provisions are most often applied to Group A occupancies, they would also address  
other assembly uses, such as those assembly rooms accessory to Group E occupancies. Although  
the classification of such areas may be based on the educational function of the building, it is  
important to recognize that from a means-of-egress perspective the large assembly uses still  
function as assembly spaces. All of the hazards involved with assembly-type functions are  
present in school assembly rooms, regardless of whether the room is classified as Group A or E.  
Therefore, the specific means of egress provisions of Section 1030 are to be applied to all  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationassembly rooms or spaces, not just those classified as Group A.  
Bleachers, grandstands, folding seating, and telescoping seating are not regulated by Section  
1030, but rather by ICC 300, Bleachers, Folding and Telescopic Seating, and Grandstands. This  
standard, developed by the ICC Consensus Committee on Bleacher Safety, addresses the means  
of egress for such special types of seating arrangements. Simply an extension of the IBC, ICC  
300 also addresses structural design and construction features.  
1030.1.1.1 Spaces under grandstands and bleachers. In order to protect the assembly seating  
in bleachers and grandstands from an exposure to hazards, a minimum separation of 1-hour fire-  
resistance-rated construction is required to protect the seating area from the spaces below. This  
separation requirement applies where the space beneath the seating is used for any purpose other  
than restrooms of any size, limited size ticket booths, and other accessory spaces that are  
sprinklered and not more than 1,000 square feet \(92.9 m2\) in floor area. While Section 903.2.1.5  
would not generally require the sprinkler system until the space exceeded 1,000 square feet \(92.9  
m2\), this requirement is specific that the smaller spaces must be sprinklered in order to eliminate  
the 1-hour separation. Conceptually, this requirement for protection on the underside of the  
seating is similar to the required protection of enclosed usable space beneath an exterior stairway  
\(see Section 1011.7.4\). It is intended that the provision apply to storage rooms, concession  
stands, locker rooms, and similar areas where there is a concern due to the amount of  
combustible loading directly beneath an assembly seating area. It should be assumed that the  
requirement for a protective covering need not be applied where the means of egress passes  
below the seating area due to the absence of combustible materials.  
1030.2 Assembly main exit. This section provides special exiting requirements for assembly  
buildings, rooms, and spaces. The first specification is that every assembly use having an  
occupant load greater than 300 must be provided with a main exit. The minimum required width  
of this main exit is determined by two criteria—calculated width \(required capacity\) and  
component width \(minimum width\). The greater required width for the main exit is the one that  
would govern the required minimum size.  
First, in any assembly use having such a sizable occupant load, the designated main exit must  
have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one-half of the total occupant load. Second, its  
capacity shall not be less than the total required capacity of all means of egress such as aisles,  
corridors, exit passageways, and stairways that lead to the main exit. The main exit must always  
be connected by appropriate exit components to ensure that the occupants have continuous and  
unobstructed access to a public way.  
Basically, the requirement that the main exit be adequate to accommodate 50 percent of the  
total occupant load takes into account a characteristic of human nature. The majority of the  
occupants are, in all probability, not completely familiar with the facility and its exit system. As  
a consequence, in the event of an emergency it is typical that people will attempt to reach the exit  
through which they entered. This natural tendency could put an unduly large load on the main  
exit if it were not sized according to this requirement.  
Distribution of exits is permitted where there is no well-defined main exit or where multiple  
main exits are provided. In no case, however, may the total capacity of egress be less than 100  
percent of the required capacity. Should there be multiple points of entry into the building, it  
would be unreasonable to size each point as if it were a main exit. However, where a main exit is  
specifically identified, the 50 percent rule is applicable.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1030.3 Assembly other exits. In addition to requiring that the main exit accommodate 50  
percent of the total occupant load, it is also necessary that every assembly use with an occupant  
load of more than 300 be provided with additional means of egress. They are required to be of  
sufficient capacity to accommodate at least 50 percent of the total occupant load served by that  
level. As expected, these additional means of egress must also comply with Section 1007.1  
addressing doorway arrangement.  
1030.4 Foyers and lobbies. In Group A-1 occupancies, typically theaters and similar uses,  
persons often occupy a lobby to await a presentation in the major-use area. It is important that  
while the lobby is occupied, the required capacity and minimum egress width from the major-use  
area is maintained through the lobby to the exit from the building.  
1030.5 Interior balcony and gallery means of egress. Consistent with the basic requirement for  
the number of exits in most assembly uses as reflected in Table 1006.2.1, every balcony, gallery,  
and press box that has an occupant load of 50 or more must be provided with a minimum of two  
remote, separate means of egress. In some assembly uses, more than one such feature is  
provided. These requirements for exits apply to any and all balconies, galleries, and press boxes  
in the building. The means of egress may include unenclosed exit access stairways and ramps  
between the balcony, gallery, or press box and main assembly floor in uses such as theaters,  
churches, and auditoriums.  
1030.6 Capacity of aisle for assembly. The method for calculating assembly aisle capacities has  
three distinct categories. These are buildings without smoke protected seating, with smoke  
protected seating, and open-air assembly seating. Thus, the first thing that must be established is  
the category in which the egress must be analyzed. Section 202 defines smoke-protected  
assembly seating as “seating served by means of egress that is not subject to smoke accumulation  
within or under a structure for a specified design time by means of passive design or by  
mechanical ventilation.  
” Section 1030.6.2 regulates smoke-protected assembly seating in regard  
to smoke control, roof height, and automatic sprinklers. Section 1030.6.3 will regulate open-air  
assembly seating which is defined as “seating served by means of egress that is not subject to  
smoke accumulation within or under a structure and is open to the atmosphere.  
”  
If the reduced width requirements of Table 1030.6.2 are applied in a building that has smoke-  
protected assembly seating, a Life Safety Evaluation complying with NFPA 101 must be  
conducted. An acceptable evaluation would include such criteria as pedestrian flow rates,  
movement characteristics of persons using exit systems, the nature of the means of egress system  
beyond the aisles, location of potential hazards, staff-response capabilities, facility preplanning  
and training, and other items relating to occupants’ safety. Should it be determined that a  
building is not smoke protected, or that no life-safety evaluation has been performed, the aisle  
capacity will need to be calculated using the more stringent non-smoke-protected conditions.  
Open-air assembly seating is regulated by separate capacity factors that are given in Section  
1030.6.3, but through a reference there are permitted to use the smoke-protected capacity factors  
in larger buildings where Table 1030.6.2 would give a reduced requirement.  
1030.6.1 Without smoke protection. For egress on stepped aisles, two modifications to the  
basic width factor of 0.3 inch \(7.6 mm\) per occupant are to be considered. The general  
requirement of 0.3 inch \(7.6 mm\) is based on stepped aisles having riser heights of no more than  
7 inches \(178 mm\). Where the riser height exceeds 7 inches \(178 mm\), at least 0.005 inch \(0.127  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmm\) of additional aisle capacity for each occupant shall be provided for each 0.10 inch \(2.5 mm\)  
of riser height above 7 inches \(178 mm\). The following formula represents this method of width  
increase\:  
The second potential modification applies only where egress is accomplished on the stepped  
aisle in a descending fashion. Under such a condition, an increase of at least 0.075 inch \(1.9 mm\)  
of additional width per occupant must be provided where no handrail is provided within a  
horizontal distance of 30 inches \(762 mm\). This egress-capacity increase is illustrated by the  
following formula\:  
It is also very possible that both increases will be applied to the same stepped aisles. Where  
the riser height exceeds 7 inches \(178 mm\), and a portion of the required stepped aisle capacity is  
more than 30 inches \(762 mm\) from a handrail, both modifications to the basic requirement of  
0.3 inch \(7.6 mm\) per occupant are applicable. The increase in required egress capacity can be  
shown as\:  
Where a ramped aisle is used as a portion of the means of egress, the difference in calculated  
width is based on the slope of the aisle. Ramped aisles having a slope steeper than 1 in 12 \(1\:12\)  
shall have a required capacity based on 0.22 inch \(5.6 mm\) per occupant served. Note that this  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcondition would only apply to aisles not regulated by Chapter 11 for accessibility. The required  
capacity of level or ramped egress paths having a slope of 1 in 12 \(1\:12\) or less is based on 0.20  
inch \(5.1 mm\) for each occupant.  
The required increases in egress capacity are all based on one of the primary IBC concepts  
regarding means of egress\: where it is anticipated that users of the egress system may be slowed  
in their egress travel, the path is required to be widened to compensate for the reduced travel  
speed. By increasing the width of the exit path, the occupants are expected to continue to travel  
at a relatively consistent rate through the exit system. For stepped aisle travel, a riser height over  
the customary maximum of 7 inches \(178 mm\) creates an uncomfortable condition for most stair  
users. In such cases, it is natural for persons to slow their travel in order to more safely use the  
stepped aisle. Occupants also tend to travel more slowly when descending a stepped aisle where  
a handrail is not within easy reach. Without the ability to easily grasp a handrail in case of a  
misstep, the stepped aisle user tends to be a bit more cautious. On the other hand, the presence of  
an adjacent handrail provides a degree of security that encourages faster travel. In ramped aisle  
travel, a slope steeper than that normally encountered also creates a small degree of hesitancy,  
requiring a greater width to compensate for the reduction in travel speed.  
The increases in required egress width prescribed by this section are only intended to apply  
where the minimum width is calculated based on the number of occupants served by the egress  
path \(required capacity\). The width increases are not applicable to the component widths  
established in Section 1030.9.1 \(minimum width\). For example, a minimum width of 36 inches  
\(914 mm\) is mandated for stepped aisles with seating on only one side. This condition would  
typically allow for a single handrail, which would be located more than 30 inches \(762 mm\)  
horizontally from a portion of the required aisle width. It is not appropriate to increase the  
minimum 36-inch \(914-mm\) required width based on the factors established in Item 3 of this  
section. Additionally, if the stepped aisle includes risers that exceeded a height of 7 inches \(178  
mm\), the adjustment found in Item 2 would also not be applied to the minimum component  
width as established in Section 1030.9.1.  
1030.6.2 Smoke-protected assembly seating. Calculation of egress capacity in an assembly  
space located in a smoke-protected environment is based on Table 1030.6.2. As the total number  
of seats in the smoke-protected assembly occupancy increases, egress-capacity requirements  
continue to decrease until reaching an end point of 25,000 or more seats. As addressed earlier, a  
Life Safety Evaluation must be done for a facility using the reduced capacity requirements of  
Table 1030.6.2. Application Example 1030-1 shows how the calculated width of exit provisions  
would be applied for smoke-protected seating and seating without smoke protection. The  
permitted reduction in egress capacity applies to aisles, but only to the extent that the aisles and  
aisle accessways are smoke protected. Any egress elements that are not provided with complying  
smoke protection are subject to the greater capacities established for areas that are not smoke  
protected.  
1030.6.2.1 Smoke control. To maintain an essentially smoke-free means of egress system, a  
smoke-control system complying with Section 909 must be provided. As stated in Section 909.1,  
a smoke-control system should be designed to provide a tenable environment for the evacuation  
or relocation of occupants. When it can be satisfactorily demonstrated to the building official, a  
design incorporating a natural venting system is permitted. The natural or mechanical ventilation  
must be designed to maintain the smoke level at a point 6 feet \(1,829 mm\) or more above the  
floor level of any portion of the means of egress within the smoke-protected assembly seating  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationarea.  
1030.6.2.2 Roof height. Whenever smoke-protected assembly seating is covered by a roof, a  
minimum clearance of 15 feet \(4,572 mm\) is required between the highest aisle or aisle  
accessway to the lowest portion of the roof. In an outdoor stadium, the roof canopy need only be  
80 inches \(2,032 mm\) or more above the highest aisle or aisle accessway, provided there are no  
projections or obstructions below the 80-inch \(2,032-mm\) level. By providing an adequate roof  
height above the occupiable portion of the building or structure, a smoke-containment area is  
created. Smoke control or removal would then limit smoke migration into the egress  
environment.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1030-1  
1030.6.2.3 Automatic sprinklers. Another condition for the use of the liberal egress width  
provisions for smoke-protected assembly seating areas is the installation of an approved  
automatic sprinkler system. In general, the sprinkler system is required in all areas enclosed by  
walls and ceilings in buildings or structures containing smoke-protected assembly seating.  
However, two exceptions identify locations where sprinklers may be omitted. Where the area on  
the assembly room floor is used for low fire-hazard uses such as performances, contests, or  
entertainment, sprinklers may be omitted, provided the roof construction is more than 50 feet  
\(15,240 mm\) above the floor level. Small storage facilities and press boxes under 1,000 square  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfeet \(92.9 m2\) in area are also exempt.  
1030.6.3 Open-air assembly seating. Where the facilities are outdoors, such as in a stadium,  
and the egress system for the assembly seating is considered protected owing to the natural  
ventilation available, the required capacity is based on one of two factors. Where the egress is by  
stepped aisles, the capacity factor is 0.08 inch \(2.0 mm\) per occupant, whereas it is 0.06 inch  
\(1.52 mm\) for level aisles and ramped aisles. An example of this calculation is shown in  
Application Example 1030-2. If, however, the capacity calculated through the use of Table  
1030.6.2 for smoke-protected seating is determined to be a lesser capacity, such a lesser capacity  
is acceptable. A quick comparison of the factors in Section 1030.6.3 and Table 1030.6.2 would  
show that Table 1030.6.2 could start yielding smaller capacity factors as the total occupant count  
approaches 20,000. Remember that Section 1030.6.2 does permit interpolation between the  
specific values shown in the table. As mentioned in Section 1030.6.2.3, automatic sprinkler  
systems are generally required in these assembly seating facilities, but in the case of open-air  
facilities a third exception eliminates the requirement where the seating facility and the means of  
egress are essentially open to the outside.  
Application Example 1030-1  
1030.7 Travel distance. Travel distance in assembly occupancies is regulated under one of three  
conditions\: seating without smoke protection, smoke-protected seating, and open-air seating. The  
measurement of this distance shall be along the line of travel, including along the aisles and aisle  
accessways, from each seat to the nearest exit door. It is improper to measure this travel distance  
over or on the seats. Using the code’s general requirements in Section 1017, within a building  
without the benefit of smoke protection, travel distance is limited to 200 feet \(60,960 mm\) in  
nonsprinklered buildings and 250 feet \(72,200 mm\) in sprinklered buildings. In smoke-protected  
assembly seating, a maximum travel distance could reach up to 400 feet \(122 m\). This is limited  
to a maximum of 200 feet \(60,960 mm\) being permitted from each seat to the nearest entrance to  
an egress concourse, and then up to another 200 feet \(60,960 mm\) of travel is permitted from the  
egress concourse entrance to an egress stair, ramp, or walk at the building exterior. In open-air  
seating facilities where all portions of the means of egress are open to the outside, the maximum  
travel distance is 400 feet \(121,920 mm\). This distance is measured from each seat to the exterior  
of the seating facility. When the outdoor seating facilities are of Type I or II noncombustible  
construction, the travel distance may be unlimited.  
1030.8 Common path of egress travel. By providing persons in an assembly occupancy a  
choice of travel paths, egress opportunities will be enhanced. The distance an occupant must  
travel prior to reaching a point where two paths are available is more limited than permitted by  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe general provisions of Section 1006.2.1. In most assembly seating areas, the common path of  
travel is limited to 30 feet \(9,144 mm\). In smoke-protected or open-air areas, up to 50 feet  
\(15,240 mm\) of common path travel is permitted. Where the seating area has a limited occupant  
load, additional travel is also permitted.  
1030.8.1 Path through adjacent row. Because the common path of travel is most often limited  
to 30 feet \(9,144 mm\), single-access seating areas are often required to egress through rows of  
the adjoining seating area to reach another aisle in order to comply. Such seating areas are served  
by an aisle on only one side, and the aisle is single directional \(top loading or bottom loading  
only\). Where this condition occurs, the code \(1\) limits the maximum number of seats in the  
adjoining row to 24 and \(2\) increases the minimum required width of the aisle accessway serving  
the row. The exception allows additional seating in the row and modifies the increase in the aisle  
access width for smoke-protected or open-air facilities. A similar concept is applied in Section  
1030.9.5 for increasing the maximum permitted length of dead-end aisles.  
1030.9 Assembly aisles are required. This section requires that aisles be provided in all  
occupied portions of any assembly occupancy that contains seats, tables, displays, and similar  
fixtures or equipment. Although the intent of the aisle provisions is to provide safe access to  
components of the egress system such as exits or exit access doorways, the provisions would also  
have application to occupied-use areas where it is necessary to provide a circulation system so  
that building occupants will have reasonable means for moving around in the occupied spaces.  
Egress travel within restaurants, classrooms, and similar uses with seating at tables is regulated  
by Section 1030.13.1.  
1030.9.1 Minimum aisle width. Where seating is arranged in rows, the clear width shall not be  
less than the following, while still conforming to the calculated aisle-width \(required capacity\)  
provisions\:  
1\. Forty-eight inches \(1,219 mm\) for stepped aisles where seating is provided on both sides  
of an aisle. A 36-inch \(914-mm\) aisle is permitted where the aisle serves less than 50  
seats.  
2\. Thirty-six inches \(914 mm\) for stepped aisles where seating is provided only on one side  
of an aisle. Only 23 inches \(584 mm\) of aisle width is required between a stepped aisle  
handrail and the nearest seat where an aisle serves no more than five rows on only one  
side.  
3\. Twenty-three inches \(584 mm\) between a stepped aisle handrail and the nearest seat  
where the rail is within the aisle.  
4\. 5. Forty-two inches \(1,067 mm\) for level or ramped aisles where seating is provided on both  
sides of an aisle. A 36-inch \(914-mm\) aisle is permitted where the aisle serves less than  
50 seats, and a minimum of 30 inches \(762 mm\) is allowed where serving 14 seats or less  
and not serving as an accessible route.  
Thirty-six inches \(914 mm\) for level or ramped aisles where seating is provided on only  
one side of an aisle. Only 30 inches \(762 mm\) of aisle width is required where the aisle  
serves no more than 14 seats and does not serve as an accessible route.  
This section must be used in concert with the other provisions of Section 1030 to completely  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdefine and arrange an assembly seating area.  
1030.9.2 Aisle catchment area. The occupant load served by an aisle is the determining factor  
in establishing its minimum required width based on capacity. In this determination, it is  
assumed that the egress travel is distributed evenly among the adjacent travel paths. The tributary  
occupant load would be assigned to each aisle proportionally, based on the arrangement of the  
means of egress.  
1030.9.3 Converging aisles. Where aisles converge to form a single aisle, the capacity of that  
single aisle shall not be less than the combined required capacity of the converging aisles. There  
is no penalty for providing aisles that are wider than the minimum code requirement.  
1030.9.4 Uniform width and capacity. Where egress is possible in two directions, the shape of  
an aisle cannot be of an hourglass configuration. The minimum width and required capacity must  
be maintained throughout. A tapered aisle is allowed only for dead-end aisle conditions or where  
the provided width exceeds the required minimums for that capacity.  
1030.9.5 Dead-end aisles. In the arrangement of a seating area, all aisles serving the seating area  
must end in a cross aisle, foyer, doorway, vomitory, or concourse. In large facilities, it is not  
uncommon to find a number of aisles leading to a number of cross aisles. The required egress  
capacity of a cross aisle is the same as that for converging aisles, the combined required  
capacities of the aisles leading to the cross aisle. Although dead-end aisles are allowed, their  
length is limited to 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) except where the seats served by the dead-end aisle are  
not more than 24 seats from another aisle measured along a row having a minimum clear width  
of 12 inches plus 0.6 inch \(305 mm plus 15 mm\) for each additional seat over seven in a row \(10  
where seats are without backrests\). The extended dead-end allowances are permitted for aisles  
longer than 16 rows provided the 24-seat limitation is applied to the seats beyond the 16th row.  
For smoke-protected assembly seating, up to 21 rows are permitted in a dead-end vertical aisle  
except where the seats served by the dead-end aisle are not more than 40 seats from another aisle  
measured along a row having a minimum clear width of 12 inches plus 0.3 inch \(305 mm plus  
7.6 mm\) for each additional seat over seven in a row \(10 where seats are without backrests\).  
1030.10 Transitions. An important aspect of safe travel, for both egress and circulation  
purposes, is the consistency of the building elements along the path. Where there is a transition  
from one element to another, it is important to provide a condition such that the user is not  
subjected to a hazardous condition. Where a transition between a stairway and a stepped aisle  
does not alter the rise/run configuration that has been established, there is no need to apply any  
special requirements. However, where the riser and/or tread dimensions differ between the two  
elements, a means of providing a safe and smooth transition must be provided. Distinctive  
marking is also required to better identify the transition. Section 1030.12 should be reviewed  
where vomitories exist and transitions occur.  
1030.13 Aisle accessways. The provisions of this section are specific to aisle accessways serving  
two different conditions\: seating at tables and seating in rows.  
1030.13.1 Seating at tables. Because it is often difficult to determine the exact dimensions of  
chairs and other seating that may encroach into an aisle or aisle accessway, a measurement of 19  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationinches \(483 mm\) is used to account for any potential obstruction caused by the seating. The 19-  
inch \(483-mm\) distance, applicable for movable seating, is measured perpendicular to the edge  
of the table or counter where the seating is provided. Where fixed seating is provided, the width  
is to be measured to the back of the seat. Examples of the use of this provision are illustrated in  
Figure 1030-1. Where other side boundaries are present, the clear width is to be measured to  
walls, tread edges, seating edges, or similar elements.  
1030.13.1.1 Aisle accessway capacity and width for seating at tables. The clear width of aisle  
accessways serving various arrangements of seating at tables or counters is based on 12 inches  
\(305 mm\) plus ½ inch \(12.7 mm\) of additional width for each 1 foot \(305 mm\), or fraction  
thereof, beyond 12 feet \(3,658 mm\) of aisle accessway length. This length is measured from the  
center line of the seat farthest from the aisle.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1030-1 Seating at tables and counters.  
It should be remembered that in no case should the width be less than that based on the  
capacity requirements of Section 1005.3.2. On the other hand, there is no minimum width  
required for those portions of aisle accessways serving four or fewer persons and 6 feet \(1,829  
mm\) or less in length.  
1030.13.1.2 Seating at table aisle accessway length. Consistent with other provisions for means  
of egress, single-directional travel along aisle accessways is also limited in length. The distance  
from any seat to the point where two or more paths of egress travel are available to separate exits  
is limited to 30 feet \(9,144 mm\). In application, the 30-foot \(9,144-mm\) limitation would be the  
maximum length of a dead-end aisle accessway. Within that distance, the aisle accessway must  
reach an aisle or other means of egress element where travel would be limited based on the  
common path provisions of Section 1006.2.1. Various examples of the width provisions for aisle  
accessways serving seating and tables are shown in Figure 1030-2.  
Figure 1030-2 Egress width at tables.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1030.13.2 Clear width of aisle accessways serving seating in rows. The minimum clear width  
between rows of seats is 12 inches \(305 mm\), measured between the rearmost projection of the  
seat in the forward row and the foremost projection of any portion of the seat in the row behind,  
where the rows have 14 or fewer seats. If automatic or self-rising seats are used \(such as in  
movie theaters\), the minimum clear width shall be measured with the seat up. If any chair in the  
row does not have an automatic- or self-rising seat, the measurement must be made with the  
chair in the down position. See Figure 1030-3. Seats with folding tablet arms are regulated in a  
special manner. Unless the tablet arm is of a type that automatically returns to the stored position  
by gravity when raised manually to the vertical position, the row spacing measurement must be  
taken with the arm in the position in which it is used.  
Such clear width must be increased whenever the number of seats in a row exceeds 14, but in  
no case shall the number of seats in any row exceed 100. The increased width when seating rows  
are served by aisles or doorways at both ends of a row is the minimum 12 inches plus 0.3 inch  
\(305 mm plus 7.6 mm\) for each additional seat over 14; however, the width need not exceed 22  
inches \(559 mm\). The establishment of the minimum required width is illustrated in the  
following formula\:  
Figure 1030-3 Aisle accessway width.  
By interpreting the formula, we find that the maximum required clear width occurs when the  
number of seats in a row reaches 48. See Figure 1030-4.  
In smoke-protected and open-air facilities, the maximum number of seats permitted for a 12-  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationinch-wide \(305-mm\) aisle accessway with dual access is permitted to exceed the 14-seat limit for  
seating areas without smoke protection. With a maximum that varies up to 21 seats for seats with  
backrests, the limitations indicated in Table 1030.13.2.1 are based on the total occupant load  
devoted to assembly seating. Increases on single-access aisle accessways are also available. A  
similar version of the previous formula can be used with Table 1030.13.2.1 to determine the  
minimum required aisle accessway width when the number of seats permitted for a 12-inch-wide  
\(305-mm\) aisle accessway is exceeded in a building provided with smoke-protected assembly  
seating or for an open-air facility. As an example, assume a 16,000-seat arena provided with  
smoke-protected assembly seating. A dual-access row contains 34 seats. The minimum required  
aisle accessway \(row\) width is determined by the following formula\:  
Figure 1030-4 Maximum required aisle accessway width.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFor rows of seating served by an aisle or doorway at only one end of a row, the formula for  
the clear width is the minimum 12 inches plus 0.6 inch \(305 mm plus 15 mm\) for each seat over  
seven, but the clear width need not exceed 22 inches \(559 mm\). This is similar to the previous  
provision with one major difference\: a maximum 30-foot \(9,144-mm\) path of travel is permitted  
from the occupant’s seat to a point where there is a choice of two directions of travel to an exit.  
This can be to the adjacent two-way aisle or along a dead-end aisle to a cross-aisle or doorway.  
See Figure 1030-5. Where one of the two paths of travel is across the aisle through a row of seats  
to another aisle, the maximum of 24 seats rule described previously is in effect. For smoke-  
protected assembly seating, single direction travel distance can be increased per Table  
1030.13.2.1.  
Figure 1030-5 Row spacing.  
1030.14 Assembly aisle walking surfaces. Where aisles have a slope of 1 unit vertical in 8 units  
horizontal \(12.5-percent slope\) or less, steps in the aisles are prohibited because occupants in  
low-slope aisles have a tendency to not notice steps as readily as they would in the steeper aisles.  
Continuous surfaces are safer surfaces.  
Where an aisle has a slope steeper than 1 unit in 8 units horizontal \(12.5-percent slope\), a  
stepped aisle with a series of risers and treads must be used. These risers and treads shall extend  
the entire width of the aisle, shall in general, have a rise of no more than 8 inches \(203 mm\) nor  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationless than 4 inches \(102 mm\), and shall be uniform for the entire flight. The tread shall not be less  
than 11 inches \(279 mm\) and shall be uniform throughout the flight. As a general rule, variations  
in run or height between adjacent treads or risers shall not exceed 3/16 inch \(4.8 mm\).  
One provision that helps the user of an aisle notice a step is the provision requiring a  
contrasting strip or other approved marking on the leading edge of each tread. Designed to  
identify the edge of each tread when viewed in descent, this marking strip may be omitted where  
it can be shown that the location of each tread is readily apparent.  
Where changes in riser height are needed to match the changes in seating sightlines, an  
exception permits variations in riser height to exceed 3/16 inch \(4.8 mm\) between risers,  
provided the exact location of such a variation is clearly identified with a marking strip at the  
nosing or leading edge adjacent to the nonuniform risers. This edge marking strip, having a  
width between 1 inch and 2 inches \(25 mm and 51 mm\), shall be distinctively different from the  
contrasting marking strip required on each tread. In another exception to the riser height  
provision, riser heights may be increased to 9 inches \(229 mm\) where it can be demonstrated that  
lines of sight would otherwise be impaired. The permitted variations between adjacent risers are  
controlled by Section 1030.14.2.2.1 and depend on whether the risers are intended to be  
consistent or if they are designed to match the seating sightlines.  
1030.15 Seat stability. Because of the potential obstructions to the paths of egress travel caused  
by loose seating, this section requires seats in assembly uses to be securely fastened to the floor.  
The following six exceptions identify conditions under which the securing of seating is either  
impractical or unnecessary\:  
1\. 2. 3. Where 200 or fewer seats are provided on a flat floor surface  
Where seating is at tables and the floor surface is flat  
Where more than 200 seats are fastened together in groups of three or more on a flat floor  
surface  
4\. 5. Where seating flexibility is critical to the function of the space, and 200 or fewer seats are  
provided on tiered levels  
Where level seating is separated by railings or similar barriers into groupings of 14 seats  
or fewer  
6\. Where seating is separated by railings or similar barriers and limited to use by musicians  
or other performers  
1030.16 Handrails. All ramped aisles having a slope steeper than 1 unit vertical in 15 units  
horizontal \(6.7-percent slope\), and all stepped aisles shall have handrails complying with Section  
1014\. The handrails can be placed on either side of or down the center of the aisle served and can  
project into the required width no more than 4½ inches \(114 mm\). Where aisles are 74 inches  
\(1,880 mm\) or greater in width and have seating on only one side, then a minimum of two  
handrails are required and one must be located within 30 inches \(762 mm\) of the edge of the  
stepped aisle. This requirement addressing these wider aisles is intended to help regulate what  
are often called "social stairs" which are somewhat a hybrid between stairways and assembly  
seating. Figure 1030-6 illustrates this requirement.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1030-6 Handrails requirements of social stairway.  
Handrails may be omitted where the slope of the aisles is not greater than 1 unit vertical in 8  
units horizontal \(12.5-percent slope\) with seating on both sides, or where a guard that conforms  
to the size and shape requirements of a handrail is located at one side. The first exception intends  
the seating to be a substitute for handrails. The second exception permits a graspable top rail of a  
guard to be used as the handrail where a drop-off occurs on the one side of the aisle.  
Handrails located within the aisle width shall not be continuous, but shall provide gaps at  
intervals not exceeding five rows. The width of these gaps should not be less than 22 inches \(559  
mm\), nor more than 36 inches \(914 mm\). This is to provide access to seating on either side of the  
rail and to facilitate the flow of users on the aisle. A rail located 12 inches \(305 mm\) below the  
main handrail is required to prevent users from ducking under the handrail and hindering flow.  
Also, it provides a handrail for toddlers who may be using the aisle. Where a stepped aisle is  
required to have two handrails as would be required for wider aisles on social stairways, the mid-  
aisle handrail is also to be discontinuous. This is illustrated in Figure 1030-6 and places a  
stepped aisle adjacent to the seating platforms and leaves the remaining portion of the stepped  
aisle to serve more like a traditional stairway.  
1030.17 Assembly guards. The code requires minimum 26-inch-high \(660-mm\) guards between  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationaisles parallel to seats \(cross aisles\) and the adjacent floor or grade below where an elevation  
change of 30 inches \(762 mm\) or less occurs. An exception exists where the backs of seats on the  
front of the cross aisle project 24 inches \(610 mm\) or more above the adjacent floor of the aisle.  
See Figure 1030-7. Where the elevation change adjacent to a cross aisle exceeds 30 inches \(762  
mm\), the general guard height requirements of Section 1015.3 shall apply.  
Figure 1030-7 Guards at cross aisles.  
The intent of this provision is to provide a certain degree of protection from falls that may  
occur while occupants are using a cross aisle adjacent to a drop-off. Even if the drop is minimal,  
the conditions of egress from an assembly use, particularly in low light, dictate the need for an  
increased level of safety. In addition, where the top of the seat backs are less than 24 inches \(610  
mm\) above the aisle floor, an unintentional impact of the seat back could cause a fall over the  
seats.  
In order to provide for proper viewing in auditoriums, theaters, and similar assembly uses  
where the floor or footboard elevation is more than 30 inches \(762 mm\) above the floor or grade  
below, a guard in front of the first row of fixed seats, and that is not at the end of an aisle, may be  
26 inches \(660 mm\) in height. Under such conditions, a guard height of at least 36 inches \(914  
mm\) high shall extend the full width of the aisle at the foot of the aisle. In addition, the top of the  
guard shall be located at least 42 inches \(1,067 mm\), measured diagonally, from the nosing of  
the nearest tread, as depicted in Figure 1030-8.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1030-8 Guard heights.  
Section 1031 Emergency Escape and Rescue  
1031.2 General. Because so many fire deaths occur as the result of occupants of residential  
buildings being asleep at the time of a fire, the IBC selectively requires that basements and all  
sleeping rooms below the fourth story have windows or doors that may be used for emergency  
escape or rescue. Applicable only to Groups R-3 and R-4 occupancies, as well as Group R-2  
occupancies with a single means of egress as permitted by Tables 1006.3.4\(1\) and 1006.3.4\(2\),  
the requirement for emergency escape and egress openings help ensure these single means of  
egress spaces provide a potential alternate means to escape. The concern is that when residents  
are sleeping and unaware of their surroundings, a fire will usually have spread before the  
occupants are aware of the problem, and the normal exit channels will most likely be blocked.  
The reason for the requirement in basements is that access to the exterior is limited and they are  
so often used as sleeping rooms. An exception eliminates the requirement for emergency escape  
and rescue openings for basements and sleeping rooms having direct access by means of an exit  
door or exit access door to a public way or a yard, court, or exterior egress balcony that leads to a  
public way. Emergency escape and rescue openings are also not required in basements with a  
limited ceiling height or a small floor area, provided no habitable space is provided. Basement  
sleeping rooms in sprinklered Group R-2 and R-3 dwelling and sleeping units are not required to  
be provided with an escape and rescue opening provided one of two conditions occurs in the  
basement, giving occupants a choice of two paths of travel or escape.  
The scope of this section is of particular importance as it applies to Group R-2 occupancies.  
Where at least two exits, or access to at least two exits, are provided on each story of a Group R-  
2 building, then the provisions of Tables 1006.3.4\(1\) and 1006.3.4\(2\) are not applicable.  
Therefore, the provisions of Section 1031 addressing emergency escape and rescue openings also  
do not apply. However, where the allowances of Table 1006.3.4\(1\) or 1006.3.4\(2\) permitting a  
single means of egress are used, then the Group R-2 dwelling units must be provided with  
complying emergency escape and rescue openings. In those situations where, in multistory  
buildings, one or more stories may have access to two or more means of egress and there are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationother stories with access to only one exit, the requirements of this section would only be applied  
to those stories with access to just one exit.  
The code intends that the openings required for emergency escape or rescue be located on the  
exterior of the building so that rescue can be affected from the exterior or, alternatively, so that  
the occupants may escape from that opening to the exterior of the building without having to  
travel through the building itself. Therefore, where openings are required, they shall open  
directly onto a public street, public alley, yard, or court. This provision ensures that continued  
egress can be accomplished after passing through the emergency escape and rescue opening.  
1031.2.1 Operational constraints and opening control devices. As stated in the code, these  
openings used for emergency escape or rescue must be operational from the inside of the room.  
Where windows are used, the intent is that they be of the usual double-hung, horizontal sliding,  
or casement windows operated by the turn of a crank. Although there is no specified limit on the  
type of window that may be used, Section 1031.3.2 requires that the net clear opening  
dimensions must be provided through normal operation of the window. The building official  
should evaluate special types of windows other than those just described based on the difficulty  
of operating or removing the windows. If no more effort is required than that required for the  
three types of windows just enumerated, they could be approved as meeting the intent of the  
code as long as no keys or tools are required. The code does accept compliant fall prevention  
devices with emergency release mechanisms as the opening control.  
1031.3.1 Minimum size. The dimensions prescribed in the code, and as illustrated in Figure  
1031-1 for exterior wall openings used for emergency egress and rescue, are based in part on  
extensive testing by the San Diego Building and Fire Departments to determine the proper  
relationships of the height and width of window openings to adequately serve for both rescue and  
escape. The minimum of 20 inches \(508 mm\) for the width in Section 1031.3.2 was based on two  
criteria—first, the width necessary to place a ladder within the window opening, and second, the  
width necessary to admit a fire fighter with full rescue equipment. The minimum 24-inch \(610-  
mm\) height dimension was based on the minimum necessary to admit a fire fighter with full  
rescue equipment. By requiring a minimum net clear opening size of at least 5.7 square feet \(0.53  
m2\), the code ensures that an opening of adequate dimensions is provided. Where the opening  
occurs at grade level, the opening need only be 5 square feet \(0.46 m2\) because of the increased  
ease of access from the exterior.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1031-1 Emergency escape and rescue opening.  
1031.3.3 Maximum height from floor. In order to be relatively accessible from the interior of  
the sleeping room or basement, the emergency escape and rescue opening cannot be located  
more than 44 inches \(1,118 mm\) above the floor. The measurement is to be taken from the floor  
to the bottom of the clear opening.  
1031.4 Emergency escape and rescue doors. Where a door is used for the emergency escape  
and rescue opening, this code section requires that a swinging door or sliding door be used. Other  
than that limitation, the door would be expected to meet all the general size and operational  
constraint requirements from Sections 1031.3 and 1031.2.1, which are applicable to all  
emergency escape and rescue openings.  
1031.5 Area wells. Area wells in front of emergency escape and rescue openings also have  
minimum size requirements. These provisions address those emergency escape and rescue  
openings \(windows or doors\) that occur below grade. Obviously, just providing the standard  
emergency escape opening criteria to the actual opening will get occupants through them but the  
area well may actually trap them against the building without providing for their escape from the  
area well or providing for fire-fighter ingress.  
The minimum size requirements in cross section are similar in intent to the emergency escape  
and opening criteria; that is, to provide a nominal size to allow for the escape of occupants or  
ingress of fire fighters. See Figure 1031-2. The ladder or steps requirement is the main  
difference.  
Emergency escape openings below the fourth story are not required to have an escape route  
down to grade; however, those openings below adjacent grade are so required. When the depth  
of an area well exceeds 44 inches \(1,118 mm\), a ladder or steps from the window well are  
required. The details for the ladder or steps are given in Section 1031.5.2 and are shown in  
Figure 1031-3. Because ladders and steps in window wells are provided for emergency use only,  
they are not required to comply with the provisions for stairways found in Section 1011.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1031-2 Window wells.  
Figure 1031-3 Requirements for ladders and steps.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1031.6 Bars, grilles, covers, and screens. The ever-increasing concern for security, particularly  
in residential buildings, has created a fairly large demand for security devices such as grilles,  
bars, and steel shutters. Unless properly designed and constructed, the security devices over  
bedroom windows can completely defeat the purpose of the emergency escape and rescue  
opening. Therefore, the IBC makes provisions for security devices, provided the release  
mechanism has been approved and is operable from the inside without the use of a key, tool, or  
force greater than that which is required for normal operation of the escape and rescue opening.  
Fire deaths have been attributed to the inability of the individual to escape from the building  
because the security bars prevented emergency escape.  
The very essence of the requirement for emergency escape openings is that a person must be  
able to effect escape or be rescued in a short period of time because the fire will have spread to  
the point where all other exit routes are blocked. Thus, time cannot be wasted in figuring out  
means of opening rescue windows or obtaining egress through them. Therefore, any impediment  
to escape or rescue caused by security devices, inadequate window size, difficult operating  
mechanisms, and so on, is not permitted by the code.  
KEY POINTS  
• The means of egress is an exiting system that begins at any occupied point in a building  
and continues until the safety of the public way is reached.  
• Three distinct elements compose the means of egress—the exit access, the exit, and the  
exit discharge.  
• Occupant load, the driving force behind the design of an exiting system, must be  
determined for the expected use or uses of a building.  
• Components along the path of egress travel must be sized to accommodate the expected  
occupant load served by the components.  
• Specific minimum component widths, such as those provided for doors, aisles,  
corridors, and stairways, often dictate the capacity of the means of egress.  
• Where multiple complying exitways are provided, the calculated width may be  
dispersed among the various exits or exit-access doorways.  
• With limited exceptions, the means of egress must have a minimum clear height of 7  
feet 6 inches \(2,286 mm\) throughout the travel path.  
• The code regulates the means of egress so that there is no change in elevation along the  
path of exit travel that is not readily apparent to persons seeking to exit under  
emergency conditions.  
• Exit access describes the vast majority of a building’s floor area that provides the  
access necessary to reach a protected area \(an exit\).  
• Access to at least two means of egress is typically required from floor levels above the  
first story, and rooms or areas having sizable occupant loads or excessive travel  
distance.  
• As a general rule, exit signs are required from rooms or areas requiring access to two or  
more paths of exit travel.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation• Requiring continuous illumination, exit signs must be provided with a secondary source  
of power.  
• In those rooms or areas requiring access to at least two exitways, a second source of  
power is required for maintaining illumination to the exit path.  
• Guards must be designed to reduce the probability of falls from one level to a lower  
level that exceeds 30 inches \(762 mm\) in elevation difference.  
• Guards are typically required to be at least 42 inches \(1,067 mm\) in height.  
• In all public areas, guards must have limited openings to prevent individuals from  
falling or climbing through the guard assembly.  
• In addition to providing proper access to and through a building, an accessible means of  
egress must be provided.  
• Areas of refuge are mandated for certain buildings where stairs and/or elevators occur  
along the accessible means of egress.  
• Doors are highly regulated in the IBC because of their potential for obstructing the  
means of egress.  
• The use of revolving, overhead, and sliding doors for egress purposes is strictly limited.  
• Doors swinging in the same direction as egress travel are mandated for all hazardous  
uses, as well as areas in other uses having an occupant load of 50 or more.  
• Criteria for an acceptable latching or locking device on an egress door are very basic in  
that no key, special effort, or special knowledge is necessary to open the door.  
• Where security issues are as important as those addressing fire and life safety, the IBC  
permits the installation of delayed egress locks.  
• Panic hardware is mandated for swinging doors in Group A and E occupancies having  
an occupant load of 50 or more, as well as in all Group H occupancies.  
• Gates located in the means of egress are regulated in a manner similar to doors.  
• A stair is considered a change of elevation accomplished by one or more risers, whereas  
one or more flights of such stairs make up a stairway, along with any landings that  
connect to them.  
• There are two different stairways addressed in the IBC—exit access stairways and  
interior exit stairways.  
• Exit access stairways may be unenclosed where connecting no more than two adjacent  
stories.  
• Treads and risers must be appropriately sized and uniform throughout the stair flight.  
• Spiral stairways, curved stairways, and alternating tread devices are limited in their use  
because of the uniqueness of their configurations.  
• Handrail design is regulated for height, size, shape, and continuity.  
• Ramps must be designed for egress purposes as well as for accessibility.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation• Multiple exit paths must be arranged in order to minimize the risk of a single fire  
blocking all of the exitways.  
• Egress from a room through a nonhazardous accessory area is permitted, provided there  
is a discernible egress path that is direct and obvious.  
• Travel distance is limited within the exit access portion of the means of egress;  
however, once an exit is reached, travel distance is no longer regulated.  
• In rooms where seating is at tables, additional limitations are placed upon the aisles and  
aisle accessways used for egress purposes.  
• Corridors are intended to be used for circulation and egress purposes, and at times must  
be constructed as a protected element for use as a path for egress travel.  
• The exit is the portion of the means of egress that provides a degree of occupant  
protection from fire, smoke, and gases.  
• Horizontal exits, exit passageways, interior exit stairways and ramps, exterior exit doors  
at the level of exit discharge, exterior exit ramps, and exterior exit stairways are the exit  
components addressed in the IBC.  
• Interior exit stairways are to be constructed of either 1-hour or 2-hour fire-resistance-  
rated construction with protected openings.  
• Openings and penetrations into an interior exit stairway or ramp are strictly limited  
because of the hazards involved with vertical egress.  
• An exit passageway is similar to a corridor but is built to a higher level and limited in  
much the same manner as a vertical exit enclosure.  
• The concept of a horizontal exit is the creation of a refuge area to be used by occupants  
fleeing the area of fire origin.  
• The use of an exterior exit stairway as a required means of egress element is limited to  
buildings not exceeding six stories or 75 feet \(22,860 mm\).  
• In high-rise buildings, luminous egress path markings are required in exit enclosures  
and exit passageways of Group A, B, E, I-1, M, and R-1 occupancies.  
• Egress travel outside of the building at grade level is considered exit discharge,  
continuing until the public way is reached.

Key Points  
This chapter addresses accessibility and usability of buildings and their elements for persons  
with physical disabilities. Where a facility is designed and constructed in accordance with this  
chapter and other related provisions throughout the International Building Code® \(IBC®\), it is  
considered accessible.  
A historical perspective. In 1961, the American National Standards Institute \(ANSI\)  
published ANSI Standard A117.1. The President’s Committee on Employment of the  
Handicapped and the National Easter Seal Society were designated as the secretariat for the  
standard. Since that time, a number of historic events have occurred that have brought  
accessibility and usability issues to the forefront of not only building code enforcement, but of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsociety as a whole.  
In the early 1970s, all three United States legacy model code groups approved code  
changes to make buildings more accessible and usable for people with disabilities. These  
independent developments resulted in confusion in the regulatory design and construction  
community. As a result, the Council of American Building Officials \(CABO\) requested that  
the Board for the Coordination of Model Codes \(BCMC\) review the regulations and suggest  
provisions to all of the model codes that would result in uniformity. In addition, ANSI  
requested that CABO become the secretariat for ANSI A117.1.  
In October 1987, BCMC began its assignment to provide regulations that set forth when,  
where, and to what degree access must be provided \(commonly referred to as scoping\) for  
persons with disabilities. The ANSI A117.1-1986 standard contained design specifications  
intended to provide buildings and facilities accessible to and usable by people with disabilities  
but did not specify scoping provisions. Authorities who chose to employ ANSI A117.1 found  
it necessary to adopt amendments to establish when, where, and to what degree its provisions  
applied. During the BCMC work on accessibility, it became apparent that safe egress for  
people with disabilities was essential if access to buildings was to be increased. Therefore, the  
final BCMC report addressed both access and egress for people with disabilities. While  
BCMC was working on scoping provisions for ANSI A117.1-1986, the ANSI A117.1  
committee continued to study revisions to their standard for public review.  
In 1988, the United States Congress passed the Fair Housing Amendments Act to cover  
multifamily housing of four units or more on a site. On July 26, 1990, President George Bush  
signed the Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\), which set forth comprehensive civil rights  
protection to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodations,  
state and local government services, and telecommunications. The reasons legislators  
supported the ADA were the recognized inadequacy, limited application, and nonuniformity  
of existing protection for individuals with disabilities. One year later, on July 26, 1991, the  
United States Department of Justice \(DOJ\) issued its final rules, the Americans with  
Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines \(ADAAG\), that provided for access and usability for  
disabled persons in public accommodations and commercial facilities. Both acts were born  
from the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ADA set forth statutory deadlines for when certain  
requirements became effective. One of these requirements was that new facilities designed and  
constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, must be accessible.  
The public review draft of revisions to the ANSI A117.1 standard dated January 24, 1992,  
was submitted to the DOJ with a request for technical assistance. A staff comparison of ANSI  
A117.1 and ADAAG yielded only a few areas in which ADAAG was deemed to provide  
greater accessibility. Generally, the differences found between ADAAG and ANSI A117.1  
indicated that the ANSI standard provided for greater overall accessibility. At the BCMC  
meetings in May and June of 1992, the committee reviewed suggestions that would  
incorporate ADA guidelines into the ANSI A117.1 standard and other regulations. At the  
BCMC meeting on June 8, 1992, the committee finalized its report. From June 9 through 11,  
1992, the ANSI A117.1 committee finalized its standard.  
The final BCMC report of June 8, 1992, and the final draft of the ANSI A117.1 standard  
were soon adopted by all of the model code groups as their accessibility requirements. The  
final BCMC report of June 8, 1992, and the CABO/ANSI A117.1-1992 standard were  
submitted to the DOJ for a technical review. The resulting letter received in November 1995  
described nine general problems, many of which were differences in philosophy. Noncode  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationitems such as laboratory equipment, automated teller machines, and telephones were also a  
concern of the DOJ. During the DOJ review, a joint task force was established to make  
recommendations for changes to both the CABO/ANSI A117.1, Accessible and Usable  
Buildings and Facilities, and ADAAG. This harmonization effort over many months resulted  
in suggested revisions to both documents. In an effort to reduce conflict, confusion, and  
frustration among all users, the results of the harmonization report were accepted in July 1996  
by the ADAAG Review Advisory Board. That board presented its final report to the  
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, which in turn resulted in  
additional rulemaking by the Access Board.  
The CABO/ANSI revisions were finalized and subsequently approved by ANSI’s Board of  
Standards Review on February 13, 1998. Because CABO was incorporated into the  
International Code Council® \(ICC®\) in November 1997, the resulting standard was retitled  
ICC A117.1-1998. The 2009 edition of ICC A117.1 was finalized in late 2009, and its  
technical provisions and format closely paralleled those technical requirements in what at that  
time was called the proposed “new” ADA/ABA AG \(Americans with Disabilities Act and  
Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines\). These new federal regulations were  
ultimately approved by DOJ and are now known as the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible  
Design.  
These updated federal requirements were the first major rewrite of ADAAG since 1990 and  
were published in the Federal Register on July 23, 2004. The updates resulted in the  
reconciliation of most differences that occurred between the A117.1 standard and the original  
ADAAG. Although the coordination effort was not fully completed, it was expected that the  
efforts of all parties would result in a system that greatly enhanced compliance with the 2010  
ADA Standards for Accessible Design. These updated federal standards became an allowable  
alternative to the original ADAAG in March 2011 and ultimately became mandatory on  
March 15, 2012, when they replaced the original ADAAG.  
The current edition of the A117.1 standard is the 2017 edition and it has been adopted by  
reference into the 2021 IBC. This edition of the standard has continued to move forward and  
improve the level of access and clarity it provides, although it has in certain circumstances  
moved away from being harmonized with the ADA.  
On another front, efforts were initiated addressing the differences between those provisions  
of the IBC, ICC A117.1, and the federal Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines \(FHAG\). In  
2000, the Department of Housing and Urban Development \(HUD\) reviewed the IBC and ICC  
A117.1-1998 for compliance with FHAG. Based on the HUD’s report, a series of  
modifications were proposed as a part of the 2000 code change cycle. The proposed  
modifications were accepted by the voting members and were incorporated into the 2001  
Supplement to the IBC. As a result of these changes, the HUD issued a press release that  
stated that the 2000 IBC with the 2001 Supplement and ICC A117.1-1998 could be considered  
“safe harbor” for anyone wanting to comply with the FHAG requirements. The 2003 and 2006  
editions of the IBC incorporated those provisions, along with other appropriate modifications,  
and they have both been recognized as a safe harbor in compliance with the Fair Housing  
requirements. At the time of this publication, HUD has approved safe harbor status for the  
2009 through the 2018 editions of the IBC, as well as the 2009 edition of the A117.1 Standard.  
They are also continuing with their review of the 2017 edition of the standard. Given the  
previous approvals and the way the HUD and ICC have worked together to coordinate the  
IBC, it is anticipated that the more current editions of the A117.1 and IBC will also be  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdetermined to be equivalent when addressing the housing accessibility requirements.  
Section 1101 General  
The term accessible takes on a very broad meaning by requiring compliance with Chapter 11.  
Space requirements must be addressed for all portions of the building to be considered accessible  
or to provide an accessible route within a building. Space requirements apply to adequate  
maneuvering space, clearance width for doors and corridors, and height clearances.  
Location of controls, switches, and other forms of hardware becomes a function of forward  
and parallel reach ranges if they are to be considered accessible. To assist persons with limited  
dexterity, controls, and other forms of hardware need to be operable without tight gripping,  
grasping, or twisting of the wrist.  
People with visual impairments are provided with accessible routes, by the inclusion of  
provisions for clear and unobstructed routes that are free of protrusions created by benches,  
overhanging stairways, poles, posts, and low-hanging signs. Many hazards can be eliminated by  
using different textural surfaces in the accessible route to alert sight-impaired persons. Visually  
impaired or partially sighted persons can be assisted with proper signage of the correct size,  
surface, and contrast. Signage is also provided for the hearing impaired. Directional signage  
should always be clear, concise, and appropriately placed.  
To properly apply the code, users must understand the terminology and recognize the limits of  
defined terms. It is important to note that the defined terms listed in the IBC are specifically for  
this code and may have different meanings from definitions in other accessibility provisions or  
regulations, such as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. The accessibility terms defined  
specifically in the IBC are all located in Section 202. Additional definitions that apply to these  
provisions can be found in Section 107 of ICC A117.1.  
An accessible route is defined in both the IBC and ICC A117.1, and is described in Section  
402 of the latter document. Accessible routes have a number of components, such as walking  
surfaces with a slope not steeper than 1\:20, marked crossings at vehicular ways, clear floor  
spaces at accessible elements, access aisles, ramps, curb ramps, and elevators. Each component  
must comply with specific applicable standards and requirements.  
Several key elements to review when addressing accessible routes are the requirements  
related to protruding objects and ramps. An accessible route may contain a number of protruding  
objects that can affect its use. These objects include ordinary building elements such as railings,  
telephones, water fountains, signs, directories, and automatic teller machines.  
Protruding objects and other such obstructions are regulated by Section 307 of ICC A117.1.  
Similar provisions governing the means of egress system are located in IBC Section 1003.3.  
Ramps with proper slopes may serve as acceptable means of egress, as well as part of an  
accessible route. A sloped surface that is steeper than 1\:20 is considered to be a ramp and is  
required to comply with both the requirements of Section 1012 for egress paths and Section 405  
in ICC A117.1. To be considered acceptable, ramps shall have a slope not steeper than 1\:12, with  
a maximum rise for any ramp not to exceed 30 inches \(762 mm\) and a minimum width of at least  
36 inches \(914 mm\).  
Three types of dwelling units and sleeping units are defined and then required by the code\:  
Accessible, Type A, and Type B. The Accessible units are deemed to be fully accessible and  
must be in compliance with the IBC and Section 1102 of ICC A117.1. Type A units are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconsidered dwelling units and sleeping units that are designed and constructed for accessibility in  
accordance with Section 1103 of ICC A117.1. Designed and constructed in accordance with  
Section 1104 of ICC A117.1, a Type B dwelling unit or sleeping unit is intended to be consistent  
with the technical requirements of HUD’s Fair Housing Guidelines. A Type A unit is considered  
to provide a significant degree of accessibility, whereas a Type B unit provides for only a  
minimum level.  
Several other definitions in Section 202 assist in clarifying the intent of the provisions. An  
employee work area is limited to those spaces used directly for work activities and does not  
include those common use areas such as toilet rooms and break rooms. Public use areas are  
identified as those spaces used by the general public and may be interior or exterior.  
Section 1102 Compliance  
1102.1 Design. This section adopts ICC A117.1, more specifically the 2017 edition, as the  
adopted design standard to be used to ensure that buildings and facilities are accessible to and  
usable by persons with disabilities. With this section providing the accessible design and  
construction standards for buildings, the remaining sections of the chapter provide the scoping  
provisions that set forth when, where, and to what degree access must be provided.  
The importance of this section and the requirements it imposes should not be overlooked. As  
previously stated, buildings must be designed and constructed to the minimum provisions of  
Chapter 11, along with the other applicable provisions of the IBC and ICC A117.1, to be  
considered accessible. Therefore, prior to applying the code provisions for accessibility, it is  
important for the code user to review the technical requirements found in ICC A117.1. Although  
these technical requirements are not directly within the IBC, they are still applicable due to being  
scoped from the IBC and the provisions of IBC Section 102.4 related to referenced standards.  
Such elements include, but are not limited to, space allowance and reach ranges, accessible route,  
protruding objects, and ramps.  
Space requirements can vary greatly depending on the nature of the disability, the physical  
functions of the individual, and the skill or ability of the individual in using an assistive device.  
However, it is generally accepted that spaces designed to accommodate persons using  
wheelchairs will be functional for most people.  
It is important to note that not all portions of ICC A117.1 are referenced by the IBC. For  
example, the criteria set forth in Section 504 for stairways as well as the stair handrail provisions  
of Section 505 have no application insofar as accessible stairways are not specifically scoped by  
IBC Chapter 11. As a result, the provisions of IBC Sections 1011 and 1014 solely regulate all  
stairways and associated handrails for accessibility purposes. As another example, accessible  
telephones and automatic teller machines are addressed in ICC A117.1, Sections 704 and 707,  
respectively. However, these elements are only regulated in the IBC by Appendix E, which must  
be specifically adopted to be in effect.  
Section 1103 Scoping Requirements  
In general, access to persons with disabilities is required for all buildings and structures, whether  
temporary or permanent. There are, however, certain conditions under which sites, buildings,  
facilities, and elements are exempt from the provisions where specifically addressed. Various  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmodifications to the general requirements for accessibility are also found throughout other areas  
of Chapter 11. For example, an exception to Section 1104.4 eliminates the requirement for an  
accessible route of travel to levels having relatively small floor areas, applicable in all but a few  
types of uses. There are also a number of exceptions that apply only within dwelling units.  
Where the building under consideration is existing, only the requirements found in  
International Existing Building Code® apply. Intended to include historic buildings, the  
provisions apply to the maintenance, alteration, or change in use of an existing structure. An  
exception relating to Type B dwelling units and sleeping units states that they need not be  
provided in existing buildings unless substantial alterations in conjunction with a change of  
occupancy take place.  
In commercial applications, individual employee workstations are not required to be fully  
accessible. They must, however, comply with the appropriate provisions for visible alarms,  
accessible means of egress, and common use circulation paths. In addition, such work areas shall  
be located on an accessible route in order to provide access to, into, and out of the work area.  
Modifications to each individual workstation can then be made in order to address the specific  
needs of the employee. None of these limited provisions are applicable for small, elevated work  
areas where the area must be elevated because of the nature of the work performed. A number of  
other employee-use areas are also considered spaces that need not be provided with accessibility.  
Raised areas used for security or safety purposes, limited access spaces, equipment spaces, and  
highway tollbooths have been identified as those types of areas where it seems unreasonable, if  
not impossible, to provide full access.  
Observation galleries, prison-guard towers, fire towers, lifeguard stands, and similar elevated  
observation areas need not be accessible or served by an accessible route. Ladders, catwalks,  
crawl spaces, freight elevators, very narrow passageways or tunnels, and any other space deemed  
to be nonoccupiable require no access. Spaces such as elevator pits and penthouses; mechanical,  
electrical, or communications equipment rooms; equipment catwalks; water or sewer treatment  
pump rooms and stations; electric substations in transformer vaults; and any other areas accessed  
solely by personnel for maintenance, repair, or monitoring of equipment are not required to be  
accessible. In addition, highway tollbooths where access occurs only by passageways elevated  
above grade or buried below grade are not required to be accessible. Accessibility is also not  
required to walk-in cooler and freezer equipment provided they are accessed only from employee  
work areas.  
Section 1103.2.5 recognizes that some activities directly associated with construction projects  
will not be safe for persons with certain physical disabilities. Therefore, structures, sites, and  
equipment used or associated with construction are not required to be accessible. The limited  
scope of this provision is important insofar as the accessibility provisions generally do apply to  
the temporary buildings. Although accessibility would not be required to a construction trailer, it  
must be provided to sales trailers that are common in new subdivisions or multifamily projects. It  
is also necessary to know that where pedestrian protection is required by Chapter 33 and Table  
3306.1, such walkways are required to be accessible per Section 3306.2.  
For the most part, occupancies designated as Group U are exempt from the provisions of  
Chapter 11. One exception requires agricultural buildings that are associated with the general  
public to be provided with access to those public areas. An example might be a produce stand set  
up just inside the entry of the agricultural greenhouse. In addition, all paved work areas for  
agricultural buildings must be provided with access to such areas. A second exception mandates  
that where accessible parking is provided in private garages or carports, such parking structures  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationshall be accessible.  
Many religious architectural building features are based upon traditions or rituals that are  
often conducted from either raised or recessed areas within the sanctuary or worship area. Areas  
such as altars, bimahs, baptisteries, pulpits, minibars, and minarets are examples of the types of  
areas exempted from accessibility by Section 1103.2.8. The size and elevation differences  
selected for this exemption are consistent with those for employee work areas. The provision  
does not indicate that the 300-square-foot limitation is aggregate in its application, so it is  
permissible to have several elements such as a high altar, baptistery, and pulpit all addressed  
separately.  
A live/work unit, primarily regulated by Section 508.5, is considered to be a dwelling unit or  
sleeping unit in which a significant portion of the space includes a nonresidential use operated by  
the tenant. Although the entire unit is classified as a Group R-2 occupancy in the IBC, for  
accessibility purposes it is viewed more as a mixed-use condition. The residential portion of the  
unit is regulated differently for accessibility purposes than the nonresidential portion. The floor  
area of the dwelling unit or sleeping unit that is intended for residential use is regulated under the  
provisions of Section 1108.6.2 for Group R-2 occupancies. See Sections 1108.6.2.1 and 508.5.  
The requirements for an Accessible Type A or B unit would be applied based on the specific  
residential use of the unit and the number of units in the structure. The exceptions for Type A  
and B units set forth in Section 1108.7 would also exempt such units where applicable. In the  
nonresidential portion of the unit, full accessibility would be required based on the intended use.  
For example, if the nonresidential area of the unit is used for hair care services, all elements  
related to the service activity must be accessible. This would include site parking where  
provided, site- and building-accessible routes, the public entrance, and applicable service  
facilities. In essence, this portion of the live/work unit would be regulated in the same manner as  
a stand-alone commercial occupancy.  
Section 1104 Accessible Route  
An accessible route is defined as a continuous unobstructed path that complies with the  
provisions in Chapter 11. This route connects all accessible elements or spaces of the building or  
facility, including corridors, aisles, doorways, ramps, elevators, lifts, and clear floor space at  
fixtures. Code users should review the accessible route provisions in Chapter 4 of ICC A117.1.  
In addition, exterior portions of accessible routes must be evaluated and may include parking  
access aisles, curb ramps, crosswalks at vehicular ways, walks, ramps, and lifts.  
1104.2 Within a site. The clear intent of these provisions is to provide, on sites with single or  
multiple buildings or facilities, access to each accessible element from all accessible parking  
areas, as well as from one accessible element to another on the same site. Where the only means  
of access between accessible facilities on a site is a vehicular way, an accessible route is not  
required between such facilities. Should a sidewalk, walking path, or similar circulation route be  
provided connecting the site elements, the route is to be designed and constructed as an  
accessible route.  
1104.3 Connected spaces. Those portions of a building that are required to be accessible must  
be connected by at least one accessible route of travel. Such route shall connect to all accessible  
entrances and lead to accessible walkways connecting other accessible site elements and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationpotentially the public way. One exception clarifies that in assembly areas with fixed seating an  
accessible route must only be provided to the accessible wheelchair seating areas. Other  
exceptions reference various provisions throughout Chapter 11 where either accessible routes are  
not required or their extent limited.  
1104.3.1 Employee work areas. Although employee work areas are typically exempt from the  
accessibility provisions of the code, the “common use” circulation paths within such areas that  
are used by multiple employees are regulated. The paths must be designed and constructed as a  
complying accessible route unless exempted by one of the three exceptions. In those cases where  
an exception is applicable, it is still necessary to connect the work area to an accessible route  
such that persons with disabilities can approach, enter, and exit the area as stated in Section  
1103.2.2\. For the purpose of applying any of the three exceptions, it is important to note that  
common use is defined as nonpublic areas shared by two or more individuals. An example is  
shown in Figure 1104-1.  
1104.4 Multistory buildings and facilities. In addition to providing an accessible route to each  
portion of a building, each accessible story and/or mezzanine in a multilevel facility must be  
connected via at least one accessible route of travel. The first exception waives the requirement  
for an accessible route to floors above and below any accessible level, provided such  
inaccessible levels have an aggregate floor area of not more than 3,000 square feet \(278.7 m2\).  
This allowance is not permitted, however, where the vertically inaccessible level contains offices  
of health-care providers, passenger transportation facilities, multitenant sales facilities, where the  
building is a government facility, or where the facility contains four or more dwelling units.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1104-1 Employee work areas.  
This exception eliminates the requirement for an elevator or other means of vertical access;  
however, it does not reduce or eliminate the obligation of compliance with other provisions for  
accessibility. As an example, a toilet room on an inaccessible level permitted by the exception  
would still be required to comply with all of the provisions for accessible toilet rooms. In  
addition, whereas the floor either above or below the accessible grade-level floor would not be  
required to meet the applicable accessible route provisions, any facilities located on these floors  
would also be required to be provided on the accessible floor. For example, if toilet facilities are  
located on the floor either above or below the accessible floor, then the same facilities are  
required on the accessible floor and shall be constructed as accessible facilities.  
1104.5 Location. Where an interior route of travel is provided within a building, any required  
accessible route shall also be interior. The intent of the provisions is to provide equal means of  
access. For example, an interior stairway and exterior ramp fails the equality test.  
Section 1105 Accessible Entrances  
In general, at least one public entrance, but not less than 60 percent of all such entrances to a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbuilding or individual tenant space, must be accessible.  
In Figure 1105-1, two entrances \(Doors A and B\) are considered to be public entrances to the  
entire building. As such, both entrances must be accessible. If Doors C and D are public tenant  
entrances, they must be accessible in addition to the accessible entrances provided into each  
tenant space from the common lobby. One easy requirement to remember is that if there are only  
one or two public entrances into a building or tenant, those entrances must be accessible. In  
addition to the general provisions for public entrances, the code mandates accessible entrances  
under other conditions, such as between a parking garage and the building served by the garage.  
Even though the minimum number of accessible entrances has been provided at other locations,  
the direct access between the parking garage and the building must be accessible. Exceptions are  
provided for entrances used exclusively for loading and service, as well as entrances to spaces  
not required to be accessible.  
Figure 1105-1 Accessible entrances.  
An important aspect of accessibility and accessible entrances is obviously the door assembly  
and its related components, including the threshold, hardware, closers, and opening force.  
Important requirements that affect doors and their accessibility are in IBC Section 1010 and in  
Section 404 of ICC A117.1.  
To improve the access at public entrances, the IBC will require automatic doors to be  
provided for certain larger occupancies. These uses tend to involve people that are more transient  
and less familiar with the facility and only apply where the occupant loads exceed the thresholds  
listed in Table 1105.1.1. When dealing with a mixed occupancy building, it is important to read  
the footnote in the table since it will impact when the requirement applies.  
Landings on both sides of doorways are also important accessibility features. When access for  
persons with disabilities is required, a floor or landing shall generally not be more than ½ inch  
\(12.7 mm\) lower than the threshold of the doorway according to Section 1010.1.6 of the IBC.  
Where the level change or threshold exceeds ¼ inch \(6.4 mm\), it is required to be beveled at a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationslope of one unit vertical in two units horizontal \(1\:2\) or less. Similar provisions are found in  
Sections 303 and 404.2.4 of the A117.1 standard.  
Door hardware, including handles, pulls, latches, locks, or any other operating device on  
accessible doors, is required to be of a shape that is easy to grasp with one hand and does not  
require a tight pinching, tight grasping, or twisting of the wrist to operate. Many individuals have  
great difficulty operating door hardware that does not include push-type, U-shaped handles, or  
lever-operated mechanisms.  
Door closers with delayed action capability are also important and allow a person more time  
to maneuver through a door. These closers are required to be adjusted so that from an open  
position of 90 degrees \(1.57 rad\), the time required to move the door to an open position of 12  
degrees \(0.21 rad\) will be a minimum of 5 seconds. Door closers are required to have minimum  
closing forces in order to close and latch the door; however, for other than fire doors and exterior  
doors, maximum force levels are set to limit the force levels for pushing or pulling open doors.  
Opening forces and the methods used to measure them are specified in Section 404.2.8 of ICC  
A117.1 and IBC Section 1010.1.3.  
Minimum maneuvering clearances at doors, other than those that are for automatic doors, are  
based on a combination of forward- and side-reach limitations, the direction of approach, and  
minimum clear width required for wheelchairs. They also permit enough space that a slight angle  
of approach can be gained, which then provides additional leverage or opening force by the user.  
Without these required clearances, there is a possibility of interference between the edge of the  
door and the footrest on the wheelchair. This could render the door inaccessible to someone  
using a wheelchair.  
In addition to the traditional provisions for doors, ICC A117.1 contains many detailed  
provisions in illustrations that are found in Section 404.  
Care should be exercised when considering the maneuvering space necessary to make doors  
accessible. An inadvertent reversal of the latch side to hinge side may render a door inaccessible  
to an individual in a wheelchair.  
Section 1106 Parking and Passenger Loading Facilities  
The number of accessible parking spaces required on a site varies by the total number of spaces  
provided. For other than specific residential and medical uses, Table 1106.2 is used as the basis  
for calculating the required number of spaces. Rehabilitation facilities, as well as those facilities  
providing outpatient physical therapy, require a larger percentage of accessible spaces than  
addressed in the table. Obviously, this is due to the much higher probability of individuals with a  
mobility impairment visiting the facility. On the other hand, the required number of accessible  
parking spaces for Groups R-2, R-3, and R-4 is typically reduced from Table 1106.2.  
For every six accessible parking spaces, at least one of the spaces must be an accessible van  
space. As an example, consider a parking lot with 23 total parking spaces. According to Table  
1106.2, at least one accessible parking space is to be provided, and it must be designed and  
constructed to be van accessible. As another example, a parking lot with 202 parking spaces  
must be provided with a minimum of seven accessible spaces. At least two of those seven spaces  
shall be van-accessible.  
An indicator of the critical nature of site development is the requirement for the shortest  
accessible route of travel. On a site with multiple buildings and a number of requirements for  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationeach, accessibility may pose complex site-design problems related to direct routes from parking  
areas. Where the parking facilities do not necessarily serve a particular building, the provisions  
require the accessible parking spaces to be located as closely as possible to the accessible  
pedestrian entrance to the parking facility. Early involvement or early attention to the location of  
multiple accessible elements during site development may tend to eliminate most, if not all,  
related problems.  
Where multiple distinct parking facilities are provided on a site, such as a parking garage and  
a surface parking lot, the provisions of Section 1106.2 require that the total minimum required  
number of accessible parking spaces be determined individually. See Application Example 1106-  
1\. However, Section 1106.7 allows accessible spaces to be relocated from remote lots to  
locations near accessible building entrances. This addresses a concern that in a large facility, the  
dispersion of accessible parking spaces into remote lots may result in decreased access for  
persons with disabilities.  
If a passenger loading zone is provided, it shall have an adjacent access aisle that is part of the  
accessible route to the building. In accordance with ICC A117.1, the space shall have a vertical  
clearance of at least 114 inches \(2,895 mm\) at the zone and along the vehicle access route on the  
site. There are only three conditions under which the code mandates the installation of a  
passenger loading zone, where a driver would drop-off or retrieve their car, such as at valet  
parking services or mechanical access parking garages, and at accessible entrances of specified  
medical facilities. However, in other occupancies the loading zone must be accessible if it is  
provided.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 1106-1  
Section 1107 Motor-Vehicle-Related Facilities  
This section regulates the various services related to motor vehicles including electrical vehicle  
charging stations \(EVCS\) and the general fuel-dispensing systems. There are several important  
factors to notice with the EVCS. First off is the fact that these stations are not required but are  
regulated if they are provided. Secondly is the fact the provisions regulate that at least one of  
“each type” of charging system be accessible. This is important since there are a variety of  
charging methods and connectors currently available and not any type of standardized system.  
One last aspect to recognize is that while these EVCS spaces will use the size requirements for  
an accessible van parking space, these are considered as a service and not as being a parking  
space. Therefore, the signage which would be required by Section 1112 and limit who could use  
the space is not required, but it may also be helpful to determine some way of marking which  
spaces do provide the accessible charging elements.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 1108 Dwelling Units and Sleeping Units  
This section is limited to the accessibility provisions related to dwelling units and sleeping units  
as defined in Chapter 2. It provides guidance as to the conditions under which Accessible units,  
Type A units, and Type B units are mandated. These scoping provisions generally indicate where  
some degree of accessibility is required, and to what extent.  
1108.2 Design. As addressed under the discussion of Section 1101, there are three types of  
dwelling and sleeping units that provide varying degrees of accessibility required by the code.  
Accessible units are provided with the most comprehensive accessibility requirement and are  
required to comply with those applicable provisions of Section 1102 of ICC A117.1. Type A and  
B units, regulated by ICC A117.1 Sections 1103 and 1104, respectively, not only provide a  
reasonable degree of accessibility, but also allow for the use of adaptive features. This section  
reflects how it is always acceptable to design and construct to a higher degree of accessibility  
than that required by the code.  
1108.5 Group I. Dwelling units and sleeping units in a variety of Group I occupancies, including  
nursing homes, hospitals, nurseries, assisted-living facilities, group homes, and care facilities, are  
regulated for accessibility. In Group I-1, Condition 1 occupancies, at least 4 percent of the  
dwelling and sleeping units shall be Accessible units. Where the Group 1-1 facility is considered  
as a Condition 2 use, no less than 10 percent of the units must be Accessible units. In the Group  
I-2 category, however, the percentage of Accessible patient rooms varies based on the type of  
institutional facility. Hospitals and rehabilitation facilities that specialize in the treatment of  
conditions affecting mobility are required to have all patient rooms, including the toilet rooms  
and bathrooms, designed and constructed as Accessible units. General-purpose hospitals,  
psychiatric facilities, and detoxification facilities are required to have at least 10 percent of their  
patient rooms be Accessible units for their patient population. It is assumed that, in most cases,  
not more than 10 percent of the facility’s patients would need accessible rooms. In nursing  
homes and long-term care facilities, at least 50 percent of the dwelling and sleeping units are  
required to be Accessible units. This increase in the percentage of accessible rooms recognizes  
that the care recipients of these facilities may be ambulatory on admission, but may become  
nonambulatory or have further mobility limitations during their stay. In Group I-3 facilities, at  
least 3 percent of the resident dwelling units and sleeping units must be Accessible units.  
While most of the accessibility provisions are intended to allow a person to use the facility  
independently, the code now recognizes that in certain situations \(Groups I-1, I-2 Condition 1,  
and in I-2 rehabilitation facilities\) that this is not always possible and that the patients may be  
better served and need assistance with toileting and bathing. Therefore, exceptions will allow for  
changes to be made to the general Accessible unit provisions to allow for this assistance.  
1108.6.1 Group R-1. Unless intended to be occupied as a residence, a Group R-1 occupancy is  
typically regulated for Accessible units only. The minimum required number of Accessible units  
is easily determined from Table 1108.6.1.1. For example, a hotel with 185 guestrooms must  
provide a minimum of eight guestrooms that comply as Accessible units. The number of  
buildings in which the guestrooms, referred to in the code as dwelling units or sleeping units, are  
located does not impact the result, provided each building does not contain more than 50 units.  
Where more than one building on the site contains guestrooms, the aggregate number of rooms is  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationused to determine the minimum requirements. For larger buildings, those with more than 50  
units, the minimum number of required Accessible units must be provided on an individual  
building basis by applying Table 1108.6.1.1 to that individual building.  
Where multiple types of dwelling or sleeping units are provided, the Accessible units must be  
represented in each room type. However, it is not necessary to provide for additional Accessible  
units above and beyond the number required by Table 1108.6.1.1. As an example, a motel  
requiring two Accessible units and providing three room types \(such as a double, king, and king  
suite\) would only require two of the three room types to be Accessible units.  
Although all of the Accessible units must be provided with accessible bathing facilities, only a  
portion are required to have roll-in showers. The table indicates the minimum number of  
Accessible units that must contain roll-in showers as described in Section 608 of ICC A117.1.  
The minimum required number of units provided with roll-in showers is complemented by  
requiring a minimum required number of Accessible units without roll-in showers. The intent is  
to provide persons with physical disabilities a range of options equivalent to those available to  
other persons served by the facility. If the standard rooms have bathtubs, then some of the  
Accessible units should also be provided with bathtubs, and a small percentage of rooms should  
incorporate roll-in showers. Likewise, if all of the standard rooms have shower compartments,  
then most of the Accessible units should have transfer showers, with again a small percentage  
being provided with roll-in showers. It has been shown that accessible bathtubs are preferred by  
many people with mobility impairments for both security when sitting and the therapeutic relief  
from a warm bath.  
1108.6.2 Group R-2. The provisions for Group R-2 occupancies are divided into three general  
categories, those applicable to\: live/work units; typical apartment buildings; and dormitories,  
fraternity houses, and sorority houses. Live/work units are only required to provide Type B units,  
and only in specific cases. Apartment houses, along with monasteries and convents, are regulated  
for Type A and B units. On the other hand, dormitories and similar congregate living facilities do  
not need to contain Type A units, but do require one or more Accessible units.  
The mandate for Type A units in apartment buildings applies where 21 or more dwelling units  
or sleeping units are contained within the building. If two or more buildings are located on the  
same site, the aggregate number of units is used to determine the minimum required number of  
Type A units. Assuming a site contains four apartment buildings, each containing 30 units, the  
provisions are based on the sum total of 120 units. Using the 2-percent rule, at least three of the  
dwelling units are required to be designed and constructed as Type A units. Assuming that  
throughout the four buildings three types of units \(studio, one bedroom, and two bedroom\) are  
represented, a minimum of one unit of each type shall be a Type A unit. All three Type A units  
are permitted in the same building, and all may be located on the same floor level, which would  
typically be at grade. Those units that are not required to be Type A must be designed and  
constructed as Type B units unless exempted by the provisions of Section 1108.7.  
In dormitories, sorority houses, fraternity houses, and boarding houses, Accessible units are  
required in the same manner as Group R-1 occupancies. At least one of the dwelling or sleeping  
units within the building must be an Accessible unit, with additional Accessible units as required  
by Table 1108.6.1.1. As with other Group R-2 occupancies, the remaining units must be  
designed and constructed as Type B units unless allowed to be reduced by Section 1108.7.  
1108.7 General exceptions. The required number of Type A and B dwelling units and sleeping  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationunits required in Section 1108 may be reduced under the provisions of this section. However,  
there is no provision allowing the reduction or elimination of Accessible units mandated by  
Sections 1108.5 and 1108.6. Five exceptions to these requirements are included in this section.  
The first four exceptions relate to buildings with limited or no elevator service and are relatively  
self-explanatory as worded in the code. The fifth exception relates to buildings that are required  
to have raised floors at the primary entrances as measured from the elevations of the vehicular  
and pedestrian arrival points in order to accommodate the minimum required lowest floor  
elevation. Where no such arrival points are within 50 feet \(15,240 mm\) of the primary entrance,  
the closest arrival points shall be used.  
As noted, most of the exceptions are only applicable to buildings with no elevator service. It  
is expected that once an elevator is installed to access floors above the grade level, the additional  
measures to make the units more accessible are appropriate. However, the provisions do not  
mandate the installation of an elevator simply to make the upper floors accessible. Several of the  
applications of this section are shown in Figures 1108-1 through 1108-3.  
Figure 1108-1 One-story and multistory units.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1108-2 One story of Type B units required.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1108-3 Elevator service to lowest story with units.  
Section 1109 Special Occupancies  
In addition to those requirements that apply to all occupancies in a general fashion, a number of  
provisions are specific to certain occupancy groups. Assembly, institutional, and storage  
occupancies are uniquely regulated because of the special characteristics of their use.  
1109.2 Assembly area seating. In stadiums, theaters, auditoriums, and similar assembly seating  
areas with fixed seats, the number of accessible wheelchair spaces to be provided is addressed in  
Table 1109.2.2.1. Unlike parking requirements where each lot is to be considered separately in  
the calculation of the minimum required number of accessible parking spaces, the minimum  
required number of wheelchair spaces for grandstands and bleachers serving a single function  
should be based on the aggregate number of seats. For example, the total number of seats  
provided in a high school football facility would be the basis for determining the minimum  
required number of wheelchair spaces even though the bleachers may be located on opposite  
sides of the playing field. However, the accessible spaces must be dispersed in an appropriate  
manner to accommodate individuals on both sides of the field. Where the seating is in a suite or a  
box area, separate accessible seating may be required.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe requirements for wheelchair locations can be found in Section 802 of ICC A117.1,  
including a provision mandating that at least one seat be provided beside each wheelchair space  
to allow for companion seating. The required dispersion of wheelchair spaces is  
comprehensively addressed in the ICC A117.1 standard. Wheelchair spaces should be an integral  
feature of any seating plan to provide individuals with physical disabilities with a choice of  
admission prices and a line of sight comparable to that provided to the general public. There are  
two exceptions to the general rule for the location of wheelchair spaces in multilevel facilities  
that permit all wheelchair spaces to be located on the main level where the second floor or  
mezzanine level is limited in capacity.  
1109.2.5 Designated aisle seats. The intent of providing designated aisle seats is to permit  
individuals who might find it difficult to negotiate an aisle accessway the opportunity to use a  
seat directly adjacent to the aisle. The requirements of ICC A117.1 call for signs to identify the  
designated aisle seats. In addition, where armrests are installed, they must be retractable or  
folding on the aisle side of the seat.  
1109.2.7 Assistive listening systems. Assistive listening systems are required to be installed  
where audible communications are a necessary part of the assembly room’s use. In other than  
courtrooms, if the type of assembly use does not necessitate the installation of an audio-  
amplification system, an assistive listening system is not required. The number of assistive  
listening receivers is based on the total seating capacity of the assembly area and determined by  
Table 1109.2.7.1. As an example, an 800-seat theater would require at least 30 receivers, of  
which at least eight must be hearing-aid compatible, as shown in the following calculation\:  
20 receivers + 1 receiver \[\(800 seats − 500 seats\)/33 seats per receiver\] = 29.1 =  
30 receivers.  
25% of 30 receivers = 7.5 = 8 hearing-aid compatible receivers.  
These systems are intended to augment a standard public address or other audio system by  
providing signals that are free of background noise to individuals who use special receivers or  
their own hearing aids. Further provisions found in Section 706 of ICC A117.1 require that  
individual fixed seating served by an assistive listening system be located to provide a complete  
view of the stage, playing area, or cinema screen. AM and FM radio-frequency systems, infrared  
systems, induction loops, hard-wired earphones, and other equivalent devices are all permitted.  
1109.2.9 Dining and drinking areas. The general rule for accessibility in dining rooms is that  
the total floor area be accessible. This requirement includes both interior dining/drinking spaces  
and those that are outdoors. The second exception to this section eliminates the requirement for  
an elevator or ramp system to a mezzanine seating area in a dining room under strict conditions.  
Caution should be exercised when determining the same services mentioned in this exception. It  
is generally accepted that the same services not only address actual food and drink service but  
also include decor, views, and ambiance and it is equally important that a specific accessible  
space or area not be set aside and restricted for use only by individuals with disabilities.  
For spaces at accessible fixed tables or counters, at least one table in the facility shall be  
provided for wheelchairs. When more than one is required by this section, then they shall be  
equally distributed around the facility so as not to isolate an accessible area from the rest of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationestablishment.  
1109.3 Self-service storage facilities. The number of individual storage spaces that must be  
accessible at self-service storage facilities is determined from Table 1109.3. Assuming a total of  
280 spaces in the facility, at least 12 accessible storage spaces must be provided as shown\:  
10 spaces + \[2% \(280 spaces −200 spaces\)\] = 11.6 = 12 storage spaces.  
Where different sizes or classes of storage space are available, the individual accessible  
spaces shall be appropriately dispersed among the sizes or classes available, but only up to the  
total number of accessible spaces that are required. All accessible storage spaces complying with  
this section are permitted to be located in a single building.  
1109.4 Judicial facilities. Courtrooms, holding cells, and visitation areas of judicial facilities are  
required to be accessible to the degree mandated by this section. Courtrooms typically have  
elements unique to their use, such as witness stands, jury boxes, judge’s benches, and similar  
areas. Provisions are in place to provide for a limited degree of accessibility to such areas. The  
spectator area of a courtroom is regulated under the provisions for assembly seating.  
Workstations are regulated differently based on their use. Employee workstations, such as the  
judge’s bench, bailiff’s station, and court reporter’s station, need to be on an accessible route, but  
the portion of the route leading to such elevated work areas is not required at the time of  
construction. It is only necessary to provide adequate space and support such that a complying  
ramp, platform lift, or elevator can be installed in the future without extensive reconstruction.  
Workstations for other than employees, such as the litigant’s station, counsel station, and lectern,  
must provide full accessibility.  
Section 1110 Other Features and Facilities  
This section provides scoping provisions to ensure that certain elements or areas within  
buildings, where specific services are provided or activities are performed, are made accessible.  
Certain components in ICC A117.1 or other accessibility regulations have not been included in  
this section. Items such as telephones, automatic-teller machines, and fare machines are  
referenced in Appendix E, insofar as these are not typically considered items regulated by the  
building code.  
1110.2 Toilet and bathing facilities. As a general rule, all toilet rooms and bathing facilities  
shall be accessible. The term accessible applies to the doors, fixtures, clear floor space, operable  
parts, towel dispensers, and mirrors, among other elements. Typically, the main components of  
toilet facilities are the water closet, the toilet stall, and the lavatory; and the main accessibility  
issues are the clear space, door swing, transfer capability, height of fixtures, grab bars, and  
controls. In bathing facilities, a number of items related to the shower or bathtub and its location,  
controls, and grab bars need to be considered. The ICC A117.1 standard contains details and  
many illustrations that depict these requirements.  
A number of exceptions revise, reduce, or eliminate the requirements for toilet rooms and  
bathing facilities under specific conditions. Within the facility, at least one of each type of  
fixture, element, control, or dispenser must be accessible. There is an allowance for a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationnonaccessible urinal where only a single urinal is located within a toilet room.  
Exception 9 permits toilet facilities to be designed using the children’s size provisions of the  
A117.1 standard and to still be considered as being accessible. In facilities or portions of  
buildings that are primarily designed for children’s use, the general accessibility requirements  
may result in the elements not being usable by the major portion of the occupants. This exception  
provides the “scoping” requirement that will allow designers to use the children’s height  
requirements of the A117.1 standard when determining the accessibility requirements for areas  
that are primarily for children’s use. The A117.1 standard defines children’s use as “spaces and  
elements specifically designed for use primarily by people 12 years old and younger.  
” Examples  
of where the adults are in the minority and the space is “primarily for children’s use” include  
most areas of an elementary school, preschool, or kindergarten; a children’s library; or a  
children’s museum. Adult-dimensioned fixtures should be provided in other areas or spaces  
where there is a mix of all ages or where the space serves staff, parents, older students, or the  
general public. Therefore, if a restroom is provided in the staff area of an elementary school, that  
toilet room should meet the adult requirements and not attempt to use the reduced-size children’s  
provisions in that location. So even though the code permits children-sized accessible elements  
to substitute for accessible adult-sized provisions, the intent is to clearly limit the application to  
the areas that the children occupy and the fixtures that they would be using.  
1110.2.1 Family or assisted-use toilet and bathing rooms. Specific provisions are provided in  
this section on accessibility requirements for family or assisted-use bathing and toilet rooms.  
Such bathing and toilet rooms are required to comply with this section and ICC A117.1. The  
primary issue relative to family or assisted-use toilet/bathing facilities is that some people with  
disabilities may require the assistance of persons of the opposite sex and, therefore, require a  
toilet or bathing facility that accommodates both persons.  
Bathing facility requirements for recreational facilities require that an accessible family or  
assisted-use bathing room be provided where separate-sex bathing facilities are provided. If each  
separate-sex bathing facility has only one shower fixture, family or assisted-use bathing facilities  
will not be required. Accessible family or assisted-use toilet room requirements for Group A and  
M occupancies are mandated by this section where an aggregate of six or more male and female  
water closets are required. These occupancies generally have high occupant loads with a  
minimum stay of approximately one hour for the occupants; thus, a high probability exists that  
there will be occupants who will need the use of such facilities. In determining the total number  
of fixtures required in a building as mandated by Chapter 29, those fixtures located in family or  
assisted-use facilities may be included in the total fixture count.  
Family or assisted-use bathing rooms are to be provided with a water closet and lavatory in  
addition to the single shower or bathtub fixture. Family or assisted-use toilet rooms are typically  
limited to a single water closet and/or lavatory. However, it is permissible to include a urinal, a  
child-height water closet, and a child-height lavatory as additional fixtures. A complying family  
or assisted-use bathing room may be considered the family or assisted-use toilet room. In order  
to provide the appropriate privacy for a family or assisted-use facility, doors to a family or  
assisted-use toilet room or bathing room must be capable of being secured from the inside.  
Family or assisted-use toilet and bathing rooms shall be located on an accessible route. Family  
or assisted-use toilet rooms are to be located not more than one story above or below separate-  
sex toilet facilities. The accessible route from any separate-sex toilet room to a family or  
assisted-use toilet room must not exceed 500 feet \(152,400 mm\). Additionally, in passenger  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationtransportation facilities and airports, the accessible route from separate-sex toilet facilities to a  
family or assisted-use toilet room shall not pass through security checkpoints. The restriction  
regarding crossing through security checkpoints at airports and similar facilities is intended to  
eliminate any potential delays that may cause missed flights and/or connections.  
1110.2.2 Water closets designed for assisted toileting. As was discussed with Section 1108.5,  
some Accessible units within certain Group I occupancies can be modified from the general  
Accessible unit provisions to allow for assisted toileting and bathing. Sections 1010.2.2 and  
1010.2.3 address these modifications. Because greater clearances are required around the water  
closet to allow staff to maneuver beside the person they are assisting, changes are needed since  
the side wall and grab bars would not be located within the typical reach range. Having  
additional space both beside and in front of the water closet provide the space needed for the  
staff to assist whether physically standing next to them or using a lift to maneuver them. Because  
of the greater clearance width and the fact that fixed grab bars could obstruct the assistance, the  
use of swing-up grab bars is permitted under specific limitations. Typically swing-up grab bars  
are only allowed in a Type B unit and not in an Accessible unit or any public restroom.  
1110.2.3 Standard roll-in type shower compartment designed for assisted bathing. As  
scoped by Section 1108.5, these showers for assisted bathing will only be used in a certain  
percentage of Accessible units where the residents are typically incapable of unassisted bathing.  
The primary change this section makes from the normal requirements in an Accessible unit is the  
elimination of the requirement for a fixed or folding seat within the shower. In facilities where  
bathing is assisted, the residents typically would be using a rolling shower chair and not  
transferring to the seat, and the seat tends to obstruct space needed for the staff person assisting  
the resident with their bathing. Due to the elimination of the seat, an additional grab bar may be  
required on what was typically the “seat wall.  
” However, where the shower size exceeds the  
minimum sizes, then some of the grab bars can be shortened or eliminated.  
1110.2.4 Water closet compartment. At least one wheelchair-accessible compartment shall be  
provided in all toilet rooms or bathing facilities where compartments are installed. Also, an  
ambulatory-accessible water closet compartment must be provided in addition to the wheelchair-  
accessible compartment in those toilet rooms having an aggregate total of six or more water  
closet compartments and urinals. The ambulatory-accessible compartment benefits those  
individuals who, although not wheelchair users, have physical limitations or impairments that  
make it difficult to use other types of toilet compartments. Both wheelchair-accessible and  
ambulatory-accessible compartments are to be in compliance with ICC A117.1. It should be  
noted that the threshold for this provision is based on a room-by-room evaluation, not the  
aggregate number of fixtures throughout the facility. In those unusual situations where a toilet  
room or bathing room contains more than 20 water closet compartments, one or more additional  
wheelchair accessible compartments will be required based on the 5-percent requirement.  
Similarly, where the number of water closets and urinals provided exceeds 20, one or more  
additional ambulatory-accessible compartments are mandated. Proportionate accessibility is  
provided based on the recognition that it is likely that more than one user within such a large  
toilet or bathing room will be using a wheelchair, crutches walker, or a scooter. Therefore, it is  
appropriate to provide additional wheelchair compartments and ambulatory-accessible  
compartments that allow improved access and support options.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1110.2.5 Lavatories. The provisions specific to lavatories are a subsection to the other  
provisions for toilet and bathing facilities. The requirement for a minimum of 5 percent of the  
lavatories to be accessible results in a single mandated accessible lavatory in almost every toilet  
room and bathing room. Only where more than 20 lavatories are provided must additional  
accessible lavatories be provided.  
Additional accessibility features are required where the total number of lavatories in a toilet  
room or bathing room exceeds five. Where six or more lavatories are provided, a minimum of  
one lavatory must be provided with enhanced reach ranges. It is permissible for the lavatory with  
the enhanced reach range to serve as the required accessible lavatory. The technical requirements  
for such lavatories with enhanced reach ranges are found in ICC A117.1 Section 606.5. These  
types of lavatories are usable by individuals who have a limited obstructed reach depth. Such  
individuals can often only reach faucets and soap dispensers up to a reach depth of 11 inches  
\(279 mm\) in lavatories with a height of 34 inches \(864 mm\). The maximum 11-inch \(279-mm\)  
depth is possible by locating the faucet controls to the side of the bowl while leaving the spout  
toward the back, mounting the faucet on a sidewall, installing the faucet on the side of the bowl,  
or other potential locations that will provide the necessary access.  
1110.5 Drinking fountains. This section ensures that all of the drinking fountains provided are  
made accessible. This is another of the many provisions where it is important to focus on the  
word provided and note that the provision does not require drinking fountains to be installed.  
Drinking fountains must be accessible based on use from a wheelchair while still providing  
access to people with a limited ability to bend or stoop. The technical provisions set forth in  
Section 602 of ICC A117.1 address drinking fountains designed for wheelchair access, as well as  
those intended for use by standing persons. Other than the requirement for clear floor space, the  
provisions of Section 602 are applicable to both heights of fountains. Where a single water  
fountain with two separate spouts \(combination hi-lo unit\) can comply with the requirement for  
both user groups, it is permitted to be used in lieu of two individual fountains.  
The minimum required number of drinking fountains is established by the International  
Plumbing Code® \(IPC®\). At times, drinking fountains are installed even though they are not  
required by the code. It is also not uncommon for the actual number of fountains provided to  
exceed the minimum required. Under such conditions, one-half of the number provided must  
comply with the provisions of ICC A117.1 for wheelchair users, and the remainder shall  
accommodate standing persons. If an odd number of fountains are installed, an additional  
drinking fountain is not required in order to meet the 50-percent criteria. The remaining water  
fountain after the 50/50 split is permitted to be of either type. For example, if three drinking  
fountains are provided on the first floor of a building, at least one, but not more than two, is to be  
wheelchair accessible.  
Exception 2 to Sections 1110.5.1 and 1110.5.2 addresses drinking fountains used primarily by  
children. The current height of 38 to 43 inches \(965 mm to 1,090 mm\) specified in the A117.1  
for standing-height drinking fountains is too high for small children. The exceptions override the  
standard and will allow the height to be reduced to 30 inches \(762 mm\).  
Where bottle-filling stations are provided, either separately or in conjunction with drinking  
fountains, IBC Section 1110.6 will require they be accessible. The technical requirements for the  
bottle-filling stations are found in A117.1 Section 602 with the drinking fountain provisions.  
1110.9 Lifts. The provisions of this section address the limited acceptance of platform  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation\(wheelchair\) lifts as a portion of an accessible route. To use platform lifts in lieu of an elevator or  
ramp, they must comply with Section 410 of ICC A117.1 and be installed in one of the 10 listed  
locations. A companion provision, Section 1009.5, allows platform lifts to be used as an  
accessible means of egress for the first nine locations established in this section. However, the  
platform lift cannot be used as a portion of an accessible means of egress where the lift is used  
along the accessible route because of existing exterior site constraints as described in Item 10.  
Because of the slow operation of a platform lift, it is considered inappropriate for egress  
purposes where there is the potential for a large number of lift users.  
1110.11 Detectable warnings. Detectable warnings must be provided on edges of passenger  
transit platforms where a drop-off occurs, unless platform screens or guards are present. Not  
applicable to bus stops, detectable warnings should be standardized to assist in the universal  
recognition and reaction of persons using these platforms. Detectable and tactile warning devices  
also serve guide dogs and should contrast visually with the adjoining surfaces in a light-on-dark  
or dark-on-light application.  
1110.15 Controls, operating mechanisms, and hardware. To be able to operate controls,  
operating mechanisms, and hardware, a clear floor space and reach ranges for either forward or  
parallel approaches must be provided. The A117.1 standard addresses windows in Section 506  
and then also within the Accessible and Type A unit provisions of Sections 1102 and 1103,  
respectively.  
Section 1111 Recreational Facilities  
1111.2 Facilities serving Group R-2, R-3, and R-4 occupancies. Recreational facilities serving  
Accessible units in Group R-2, R-3, and R-4 occupancies shall all be accessible as applicable.  
Where recreational facilities are provided serving Type A or B units in Group R-2, R-3, or R-4  
occupancies, at least 25 percent but not less than one of each type of such facilities shall be  
accessible. All recreational facilities of each type on a site shall be considered to determine the  
total number of each type that is required to be accessible. This requirement recognizes that not  
all recreational facilities need to be accessible, nor would such a requirement be feasible.  
However, at least one of every four recreational facilities shall be available to someone with a  
disability. Where multiple residential buildings are on a site, each type of recreational facility,  
such as a basketball court, a handball court, a weight room, an exercise area, a game room, or a  
television room serving each building, must be fully accessible. Each type of recreational facility  
on a site, such as a racquetball court in an apartment complex, is considered to determine the  
total number required to be accessible. Thus, if there were 12 racquetball courts on the site, at  
least three of the courts would need to be accessible. The distribution of the accessible recreation  
facilities will also depend on the building and site they serve. Where the accessible dwelling  
units are in multiple buildings which may each have separate recreation facilities, then at least 25  
percent but not less than one of each type serving each building must be accessible.  
1111.4 Recreational facilities. The overall intent of these requirements is to provide access to  
recreational facilities so that persons with mobility impairments can participate to the best of  
their ability. The extent of the provisions is not intended to change any essential aspects of that  
specific recreational activity. The requirements are generally intended to coordinate with those of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe ADA Standards for Accessible Design.  
Section 1112 Signage  
Figure 1112-1 International symbol of accessibility.  
This section lists those required accessible elements and locations that must be identified with  
appropriate signage. Elements such as accessible parking spaces and loading zones, accessible  
areas of refuge, accessible dressing rooms, and toilet and bathing rooms that are accessible where  
some are not shall be provided with the International Symbol of Accessibility, as shown in  
Figure 1112-1. Directional signage, including the International Symbol of Accessibility, is to be  
used to indicate the nearest route to a like accessible element. Directional signage must be  
provided at inaccessible building entrances, inaccessible public toilets and bathing facilities,  
elevators not serving an accessible route, separate-sex toilet and bathing facilities \(to indicate the  
location of the nearest family or assisted-use facility\), and exits and exit stairways serving a  
space required to be accessible but not providing an accessible means of egress. Additional  
signage will be needed where assistive-listening systems are available for assembly occupancies\:  
at doors to egress stairways, exit passageways, and exit discharge; at areas of refuge; at areas of  
rescue assistance; and at two-way communication systems. Appendix Chapter E contains  
additional signage provisions such as for permanent room designations. The appendix signage  
provisions are intended to mirror the federal law, but are only enforceable under the building  
code if the appendix chapter is adopted. Similar to the general room designations of Appendix E,  
signs identifying toilet or bathing rooms are required to have visual characters, raised characters  
and braille. Pictograms may also be used on the sign. The technical details regarding signage can  
be found in Section 703 of the ICC A117.1 standard.

Key Points  
This chapter is designed to address those issues related to the interior environment aspects  
of a building’s use, such as ventilation, lighting, temperature control, yards and courts, sound  
transmission, classroom acoustics, and room dimensions  
Section 1202 Ventilation  
Ventilation in buildings is regulated based on the ventilating method used. This section addresses  
the use of natural ventilation, whereas the use of mechanical ventilation is regulated by the  
International Mechanical Code® \(IMC®\).  
1202.2.1 Ventilated attics and rafter spaces. During cold weather, condensation is deposited  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationon cold surfaces when, for example, warm, moist air rising from the interior of the building and  
through the attic comes in contact with the roof deck. This alternative wetting and drying that is  
due to condensation creates dry rot in the wood, and preventive measures are required. In attic  
areas of noncombustible construction, it is also important to ventilate the area, particularly in  
light-gauge steel construction. Therefore, enclosed attics and enclosed rafter spaces formed  
where ceilings are applied directly to the underside of roof-framing members, such as in  
cathedral ceiling applications, are to have cross ventilation for each separate space. Ventilation of  
the attic prevents moisture condensation on the cold surfaces and, therefore, will prevent dry rot  
on the bottom surfaces of shingles or wood roof decks. Figure 1202-1 provides three compliant  
examples of attic ventilation. In the areas where the moisture condensation is a particular  
problem or where the normal requirement for attic ventilation cannot be provided, ventilation of  
the attic by mechanical exhaust fans may be required. Exhaust fans are particularly beneficial in  
all cases because of the extra movement of the air provided.  
The method and arrangement of providing ventilated openings is an important aspect in the  
proper ventilation of attic spaces. It is critical that any such openings be protected against the  
entrance of rain and snow. In addition, blocking and bridging that is installed must be located so  
as to not interfere with the movement of air. At least 1 inch \(25 mm\) of air space must be  
provided between the insulation and the roof sheathing, as shown in Figure 1202-2. The net free  
ventilating area must be at least 1/150 of the area of the space ventilated. Two exceptions permit  
a reduction in the amount of ventilating area to 1/300 of the attic area being ventilated, provided  
specific criteria are met. Exception 2 is illustrated in Figure 1202-3.  
Something often overlooked when sizing attic vents is that the code requires that the area  
provided be the net free area. The net free area can be as much as 50 percent less than the gross  
area. For example, one manufacturer’s 24-inch \(610-mm\) square gable vent \[gross area equals  
576 square inches \(0.37 m2\)\] is listed in their catalog as having a net free area of 308 square  
inches \(0.20 m2\), which is about 53 percent of the gross area. The manufacturer’s literature for  
the specific vents being used needs to be consulted in order to obtain accurate free area  
information.  
1202.2.2 Openings into attic. Exterior ventilation openings are required by the code to be  
screened in order to prevent entry of birds, squirrels, rodents, and other similar creatures. A mesh  
size between 1⁄16 inch \(1.6 mm\) and ¼ inch \(6.4 mm\) is required to address the problems of both  
smaller openings being blocked by debris and spider webs, and larger openings permitting access  
to small rodents. In addition to the use of corrosion-resistant-wire cloth screening, it is also  
permissible to use hardware cloth, perforated vinyl, or any other similar material that will  
prevent unwanted entry. A cross-reference is also provided to IMC Chapter 7 to remind users  
that there are special requirements where combustion air is obtained from the attic area.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1202-1 Attic ventilation.  
Figure 1202-2 Attic ventilation—air space.  
Figure 1202-3 Attic ventilation—calculations.  
1202.4 Under-floor ventilation. Where ventilating the space below the building between the  
bottom of the floor joists and the ground by natural means, ventilation openings shall be  
provided through foundation walls or exterior walls. The provisions apply to areas such as crawl  
spaces, rather than occupiable areas such as basements. Under certain climatic conditions, it is  
possible to ventilate the under-floor space into the interior of the building, or continuously  
operated mechanical ventilation may be provided in lieu of ventilation openings where the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationground surface is covered with an approved vapor retarder.  
Figure 1202-4 Under-floor ventilation.  
To determine the minimum net area of ventilation openings required, at least 1 square foot of  
opening area shall be provided for each 150 square feet \(0.67 m2 for each 100 m2\) of crawl space  
area where the crawl space has an uncovered earth floor. See Figure 1202-4. A significant  
reduction in the minimum required ventilating area is permitted where the ground surface is  
covered with a Class I vapor retarder. In this case, the total area of ventilation openings need not  
exceed 1/1,500 of the under-floor area. In both cases, it is important that adequate cross-  
ventilation be provided in the under-floor space.  
It is critical that ventilation openings be completely covered with a substantial material to  
prevent the entrance of insects and animals. Corrosion-resistant wire mesh, with the least  
dimension not exceeding 1/8 inch \(3.2 mm\), is one of the six materials identified by the code to  
address this concern.  
Where the under-floor space is conditioned, it is unnecessary to provide ventilation openings.  
It has been shown that by insulating the perimeter walls, covering the ground surface with a  
Class I vapor barrier, and conditioning the space in accordance with the International Energy  
Conservation Code® \(IECC®\), unvented crawl spaces outperform vented under-floor areas.  
1202.5 Natural ventilation. Where buildings are not provided with adequate mechanical  
ventilation as specified in the IMC, natural ventilation through openings directly to the exterior  
must be provided. In order to determine the amount of ventilation air required, the minimum  
required openable area to the outdoors is based on 4 percent of the floor area being ventilated.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIn those cases where rooms or spaces do not have direct openings to the exterior, it is still  
necessary to ventilate the interior space, often through an adjoining room. In this case, the  
opening to the adjoining room should be unobstructed and have an area not less than 8 percent of  
the floor area of the interior room or space. In no case should the opening between the rooms be  
less than 25 square feet \(2.3 m2\). Where the intervening room is a thermally isolated sunroom or  
patio cover, the minimum openable area of 8 percent is still applicable; however, the opening  
need only be at least 20 square feet \(1.86 m2\).  
As previously mentioned, in calculating the total openable area to the outdoors, such opening  
area shall not be less than 4 percent of the total floor area being ventilated. In those conditions  
where openings that provide the natural ventilation are located below grade, the outside  
horizontal clear space measured perpendicular to the opening is required to be at least one- and  
one-half times the depth of the opening.  
Where rooms contain bathtubs, showers, spas, and similar bathing fixtures, natural ventilation  
is not an acceptable method. Because of the common reluctance to open exterior windows,  
particularly in cold-weather conditions, a mechanical system provides for more consistent  
ventilation. Therefore, bathrooms and similar spaces must be mechanically ventilated in  
accordance with the IMC. Where flammable and combustible hazards or other contaminant  
sources are present within an interior space, ventilation-exhaust systems shall be provided as  
required by the IMC and the International Fire Code® \(IFC®\).  
Section 1203 Temperature Control  
For those interior spaces where the primary purpose is associated with human comfort, it is  
important that a minimum indoor temperature of 68°F \(20°C\) can be maintained, measured at 3  
feet \(914 mm\) above the floor on the design heating day. Although the code does not require that  
this temperature be constantly provided, it does mandate that such interior spaces be provided  
with equipment or systems having the capability of maintaining the desired temperature.  
The exceptions recognize that there are conditions and occupancies where a mandate for  
space-heating systems is unnecessary. Environmental comfort requirements for Group F, H, and  
S occupancies are governed by OSHA regulations. In Group U occupancies, such space heating  
is typically not necessary, and in Group H occupancies it is often undesired.  
Section 1204 Lighting  
Almost every occupancy requires some level of lighting that is due to its use. Means of egress  
illumination is also required by Section 1008. In spite of the obvious need for interior light as a  
necessary part of a building’s function, the code mandates that some degree of lighting, whether  
artificial or natural, be provided to every occupiable space.  
1204.2 Natural light. Where glazing to the exterior is used as the method for providing natural  
light, the exterior openings shall open directly onto a public way, yard, or court in compliance  
with Section 1205. Exterior wall openings used to provide natural light must have an area that is  
computed based on the net glazed area for windows and doors, and not the nominal size of the  
opening. Where a room is not located on an exterior wall, the provisions of this section permit  
the borrowing of light from an adjoining room. Figure 1204-1 illustrates the requirements for this  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcondition.  
Figure 1204-1 Borrowing natural light.  
Section 1205 Yards or Courts  
The International Building Code® \(IBC®\) contains provisions for yards and courts where they are  
used to provide the required light and ventilation to exterior openings in the building. Most  
modern-day zoning ordinances also have requirements for yards and courts, and quite often these  
are more than adequate to gain the lighting and ventilation required by the code. In addition,  
where the alternatives of artificial light and mechanical ventilation as provided by Sections  
1204.3 and 1202.1, respectively, are used in lieu of natural light and ventilation, the provisions of  
Section 1205 are not applicable.  
To be considered providing adequate natural light and ventilation, each yard or court must  
have a minimum width of 3 feet \(914 mm\). In addition, these yards and courts must be increased  
in width, depending on the height of the building. See Figure 1205-1. As a building’s height  
increases, it is important to have an increased court width so that light coming into the court will  
be able to reach the lower stories of the building, and this is only possible where the width of the  
court is in proper relationship to the height of the court. The requirements in the code are an  
obvious compromise between optimum light at the bottom of a court and the need to build as  
much building area on the lot as possible for economic purposes.  
Inner courts that are enclosed by the walls of the buildings, sometimes referred to as light  
wells, obviously need some means to remove accumulated trash at the bottom, provide for  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationadequate drainage, and provide for circulation of air for ventilation purposes. In keeping with  
this intent, the code requires that an air intake be provided at the bottom of courts for buildings  
more than two stories in height, that grading and drainage be addressed, and that all courts be  
provided with access for cleaning.  
Figure 1205-1 Yards and courts.  
Section 1206 Sound Transmission  
Applicable only to buildings containing dwelling units and sleeping units, this section is intended  
to provide regulations addressing sound transmission control. It pertains to wall and floor/ceiling  
assemblies separating dwelling units from each other and from public space, such as interior  
corridors, stairs, or service areas. These separation elements must be provided with airborne-  
sound insulation for the walls and both airborne- and impact-sound insulation for the  
floor/ceiling assemblies.  
For airborne-sound insulation, the separating walls and floor/ceiling assemblies must be  
provided with a sound transmission class \(STC\) of not less than 50 \(minimum of 45 NNIC in  
accordance with ASTM E336 when field tested\) as defined by ASTM E90. As an alternative for  
concrete masonry and clay masonry assemblies, the STC may be calculated per TMS 302.  
Penetrations or openings through the assemblies must be sealed, lined, insulated, or otherwise  
treated to maintain the required ratings. Entrance doors only need to be tight fitting to the frame  
and sill. Floor/ceiling assemblies between separate dwelling units must also provide a minimum  
impact insulation class \(IIC\) of 50 \(minimum of 45 NISR in accordance with ASTM E1007  
when field tested\), as defined in ASTM E492. Both the STC and the IIC are also permitted to be  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationestablished by engineering analysis where a comparison is made to an assembly that has been  
tested.  
Although the scope of these provisions has historically always been limited to apartment  
buildings and other residential structures containing dwelling units, the application of sound  
transmission controls is also applicable to all buildings containing sleeping units. Although this  
would include those vertical and/or horizontal elements separating hotel guest rooms and  
dormitory rooms, it also addresses sound separations between sleeping units in institutional  
facilities, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and assisted living facilities.  
Section 1207 Enhanced Classroom Acoustics  
Good classroom acoustics are essential to support language acquisition and learning for all  
children, particularly younger children. There are three primary styles of learning in a classroom\:  
visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile. Visual learning is a teaching and learning style in  
which ideas, concepts, data, and other information are associated with images. This style  
highlights the importance of good lighting in classrooms, so students can read or see different  
images. Auditory learning is a learning style in which a person learns through listening. An  
auditory learner depends on hearing and speaking. In the instruction of auditory learners,  
teachers use techniques such as verbal direction, group discussions, verbal reinforcement, group  
activities, reading aloud, and putting information into a rhythmic pattern, such as a rap, poem, or  
song. The third style, kinesthetic or tactile learning, is learning while carrying out a physical  
activity, such as physical manipulation or experiments. Learning modality strengths can occur  
independently or in combination; they can change over time and they become ingrained with  
age. It is estimated that auditory learners make up about 30 percent of the population.  
For children who have hearing loss and those who use cochlear implants, there is no substitute  
for a good acoustic environment. Assistive technologies typically only amplify the teacher and  
do not amplify discussions among children or between the teacher and individual child.  
Additionally, children with disabilities not related to hearing, such as those with autism and  
learning disabilities, may be adversely affected by high ambient-noise levels, while students  
learning English can significantly benefit from clear speech and low background noise.  
The enhanced acoustic requirements only apply to those spaces where the room volume  
doesn’t exceed 20,000 cubic feet \(566 m3\). For example, where a 10-feet \(3,048-mm\) ceiling  
height occurs, all such classrooms of up to 2,000 square feet \(186 m2\) in floor area are required  
to meet these requirements. The criteria in ICC A117.1 Section 808 are intended to be applicable  
to standard-sized self-contained classrooms, while not addressing larger spaces used for activities  
such as band and choir. The criteria are also not intended to apply to ancillary learning spaces,  
such as individual tutoring areas.  
A classroom is limited to a maximum reverberation time for classroom acoustics, determined  
through the measurement of room performance or by a calculation based on materials on the  
floor, ceiling, and walls. Performance in a fully furnished, unoccupied classroom should include  
a maximum reverberation time of 0.6–0.7 seconds, depending upon the size of the classroom,  
and a maximum background noise of either 35 dBA \(A-weighted sound pressure level\) or 55  
dBC \(C-weighted sound pressure level\). The ambient sound levels must be measured in both  
dBA and dBC. The dBA filter measures mid-range frequencies, while the dBC filter measures  
low and high frequencies.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationReverberation time measures how quickly a sound decays in a room. The volume of the space  
and the surfaces in the room will affect the reverberation time. The intent of the 0.6–0.7 second  
reverberation time is to increase the sound level from the teacher throughout the room while  
maintaining clarity. ASTM E2235, Standard Test Method for Determination of Decay Rates for  
Use in Sound Insulation Test Methods, is used for testing sound decay rates.  
The prescriptive calculation requires noise reduction coefficient \(NRC\) ratings for every  
surface finish, including finishes on the floor, ceiling and all walls. Ratings range from 0 to 1,  
with 1 indicating the surface absorbs most of the speech sound energy and 0 indicating the  
surface reflects most of the speech sound energy. The NRC for each material is multiplied by the  
square footage of that material. The surface area of these materials are to be subtracted from the  
area of the mounting surface—for example, if a wall is 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) in length by 10 feet  
\(3,048 mm\) in height, and three 2-feet by 10-feet \(610 mm by 3,048 mm\) panels are attached to  
the wall, the calculation would be based on 60 square feet \(5.57 m2\) of panels and 40 square feet  
\(3.72 m2\) of uncovered wall.  
The ICC A117.1 criterion also considers other sound sources, including ambient sound  
sources outside the classrooms. These sources may include playground noises, airplane or traffic  
sources, and student movement in hallways. There are multiple ways to mitigate these issues.  
Some outdoor environment sources can be addressed by careful placement of the classrooms on  
the site or through the choice of the exterior materials for walls and roofs. Building noises can be  
mitigated by the proper selection of wall systems, location of doors, and placement of  
mechanical systems.  
Section 1208 Interior Space Dimensions  
Room size, tightness of construction, minimum ceiling height, number of occupants, and  
ventilation all interact with each other to establish the interior living environment insofar as  
odors, moisture, and transmission of disease are concerned. Therefore, the IBC regulates room  
sizes to assist in maintaining a comfortable and safe interior environment, and the minimum  
room sizes become increasingly important as buildings become even tighter in their construction  
because of energy-conservation requirements.  
1208.2 Minimum ceiling heights. Section 1208.2 regulates ceiling height, not only to assist in  
maintaining a comfortable indoor environment, but also to provide safety for the occupants of  
the building. As our population becomes increasingly taller, it is important that tall individuals be  
able to move about without accidentally striking projections from the ceiling.  
The basic requirement is that the ceiling height be not less than 7 feet 6 inches \(2,286 mm\) for  
occupiable spaces, habitable spaces, and corridors \(see definitions of occupiable space and  
habitable space in Section 202\). Kitchens, bathrooms, toilet rooms, storage rooms and laundry  
rooms may have a ceiling height less than 7 feet 6 inches \(2,286 mm\), but under no  
circumstances may such a height be less than 7 feet \(2,134 mm\) measured from the finished floor  
to the lowest projection from the ceiling.  
For those ceilings within dwellings having exposed beams that project down from the ceiling  
surface, the ceiling beam members may project no more than 6 inches \(152 mm\) below the  
required ceiling height, provided the beams or girders are spaced at not less than 4 feet \(1,219  
mm\) on center.  
For rooms with sloped ceilings, the code requires only that the prescribed ceiling height be  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmaintained in one-half the area of the room. However, no portion of the room that has a ceiling  
height of less than 5 feet \(1,524 mm\) shall be used in the computations for floor area. In the case  
of a room with a furred ceiling, the code requires the prescribed ceiling height in two-thirds of  
the area and, as in all cases for projections below the ceiling, the furred area may not be less than  
7 feet \(2,134 mm\) above the floor.  
1208.4 Efficiency dwelling units. This section of the code provides for a specific type of  
dwelling unit—a dwelling unit consisting of only one habitable room. Such a unit is commonly  
referred to as a “studio” apartment or residential condominium. Many of the requirements in this  
section are redundant, as this chapter already requires many of these provisions. However, there  
are some requirements that are unique to the efficiency dwelling unit\:  
1\. The living room \(which also serves as a bedroom and kitchen\) is to have not less than 190  
square feet \(17.7 m2\) of floor area. It is the intent of the code that this floor area be the  
total gross floor area, less the area occupied by built-in cabinets and other built-in  
appliances that are not readily removed and that preclude any other use of the floor space  
occupied by the built-in cabinets and fixtures.  
2\. A closet is required.  
3\. A kitchen sink, cooking appliance, and refrigeration facilities are required, each providing  
a clear working space of not less than 30 inches \(762 mm\) in front.  
4\. A separate bathroom containing a water closet, lavatory, and bathtub or shower is  
required.  
Section 1209 Access to Unoccupied Spaces  
Access to crawl spaces and attic spaces is regulated by this section. Though typically  
unoccupied, it is sometimes necessary that these normally concealed areas be accessed for  
various reasons.  
1209.1 Crawl spaces. This section of the code mandates that under-floor areas be accessible by  
a minimum 18-inch by 24-inch \(457-mm by 610-mm\) access opening. Where the access opening  
opens to the exterior of the building, the code intends it to be screened or covered to prevent the  
entrance of insects and animals. Also, it is the intent of the code that all portions of the under-  
floor area be provided with access including beneath or around obstructions created by pipes,  
ducts, and so on.  
1209.2 Attic spaces. Because enclosed attics provide an avenue for the undetected spread of fire  
in a concealed space, the code requires that access openings be provided into the attic so that  
fire-fighting forces may gain entry to fight the fire. To be of any value, the access openings must  
be of sufficient size to admit a firefighter with fire-suppression gear and must also have enough  
headroom so that entry into the attic may be secured. Although not specified, the access should  
be located in a readily accessible location. A public hallway is typically an excellent location for  
attic-access openings. Fire department personnel will not then have to open private offices,  
apartments, or hotel rooms in order to enter the attic. Attic access may be provided through a  
wall as well as through a ceiling. In split-level buildings with multiple attics, an attic-access  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationopening must be provided to each attic space.  
Attic access is only required by the IBC for those attic areas having a clear height greater than  
30 inches \(762 mm\). Where such conditions occur, an attic-access opening of not less than 20  
inches by 30 inches \(559 mm by 762 mm\) shall be provided. However, if the attic contains  
mechanical equipment, the opening may need to be enlarged to gain compliance with the IMC.  
Section 1210 Toilet and Bathroom Requirements  
The primary emphasis of this section is to provide easily cleanable, sanitary, and water-resistant  
surfaces in toilet rooms and shower areas.  
1210.2.1 Floors and wall bases. Except for dwelling units, the code requires toilet room and  
bathing room floors to have a smooth, hard, nonabsorbent surface. Finishes such as concrete and  
ceramic tile are certainly acceptable, as are other approved materials that may also be used. It is  
the intent of the code that the building official determines the suitability of the proposed floor  
surface insofar as cleanability and water resistance are concerned.  
Although the materials used for the floor covering and the wall base are to all have a smooth,  
hard, nonabsorbent surface, they can be of different materials. For example, a top set rubber base  
extending at least 4 inches \(102 mm\) up the wall is generally viewed as acceptable in  
conjunction with a floor covering of vinyl composition tiles.  
Toilet and bathing room floor-finish requirements apply to all uses and occupancies except for  
dwelling units. Because motel and hotel rooms are typically not dwelling units, toilet room  
flooring in these uses must often comply with this section.  
1210.2.2 Walls and partitions. Walls and partitions within 2 feet \(610 mm\) of the front and  
sides of urinals, water closets, and service sinks are required to have a smooth, hard,  
nonabsorbent finish. Required finishes shall extend to a height of at least 4 feet \(1,219 mm\)  
above the floor and shall be of a type not adversely affected by moisture. Materials used as a  
base for tile or wall panels must satisfy the limitations set forth in Section 2509. Although the  
code does not specifically state that concrete walls must be sealed, concrete is not, strictly  
speaking, a nonabsorbent material and needs some type of surface treatment. Sealing is  
particularly important for concrete block walls.  
Special wall finishes at water closets and urinals are not required for dwelling units, sleeping  
units, and toilet rooms not accessible to the public that contain only one water closet. Note that  
the exceptions for floor finishes and wall finishes are not the same. A private toilet room  
containing one water closet would be required to have flooring that complies with Section  
1209.2.1, but there would be no special requirements for wall finishes.  
In all occupancies, including dwelling units, penetrations of the water-resistant surfacing of  
the walls for the installation of accessories such as grab bars and towel bars are required to be  
sealed to protect the structural elements from moisture. The intent of the code is that because the  
structural elements are not required to be moisture resistant, the penetrations should be sealed to  
protect the structural elements. Although sealing is required for all walls in a toilet room, sealing  
is obviously most critical in areas of water splash such as in showers or behind or adjacent to  
lavatories.  
1210.2.3 Showers. All showers must have floor and wall finishes that are smooth, nonabsorbent,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand not affected by moisture. Wall finishes must extend not less than 72 inches \(1,829 mm\)  
above the drain inlet.  
KEY POINTS  
• The method and arrangement of providing ventilated openings is an important aspect in  
the proper ventilation of attic spaces.  
• Under-floor ventilation is to be provided through foundation walls or exterior walls in  
order to adequately ventilate the space below the building.  
• Ventilation of interior spaces may be accommodated through exterior openings or by a  
mechanical system.  
• The IBC mandates that some degree of lighting, whether artificial or natural, is to be  
provided to every occupiable space.  
• Wall and floor/ceiling assemblies separating dwelling units and sleeping units from  
each other or from public or service areas must be provided with sound insulation.  
• Most Group E educational classrooms must be provided with enhanced acoustics as  
established in ICC A117.1.  
• In specific areas of a building, floors and walls are required to have a smooth, hard,  
nonabsorbent finish.

# ENERGY Efficiency  
This chapter of the International Building Code® \(IBC®\) references the International Energy  
Conservation Code® \(IECC®\) for provisions regulating the design and construction of  
buildings for energy efficiency. The IECC sets forth minimum requirements for new and  
existing buildings by regulating their exterior envelopes. In addition, it addresses the selection  
of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning; service water-heating; electrical distribution; and  
illumination systems and equipment in order to provide for efficient and effective energy  
usage.  
The IECC contains two separate sets of provisions, one for commercial buildings and one  
for residential buildings. Each set of provisions is applied separately to buildings within their  
scope. The IECC—Residential Provisions apply to all detached one- and two-family dwellings  
and townhouses as well as Group R-2, R-3, and R-4 buildings three stories or less in height  
above grade plane. All other buildings are regulated for energy efficiency under the IECC—

Key Points  
This chapter establishes the basic requirement for exterior wall coverings, namely that they  
shall provide weather protection for the building at its exterior. The other important item  
necessary for complete weather protection, the roof system, is addressed in the next chapter.  
Chapter 14 presents general weather-protection criteria and special requirements for veneer.  
Vapor retarder materials, classifications, and installation options are also established. In  
addition, exterior wall coverings, balconies, and similar architectural appendages constructed  
of combustible materials are regulated in Section 1405  
Section 1402 Performance Requirements  
This section provides specifications for the protection of the interior of the building from  
weather; therefore, there are requirements for\:  
1\. Protection of the interior wall covering from moisture that penetrates the exterior wall  
covering.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. 3. Flashing of openings in, or projections through, exterior walls.  
Vapor retarders used to resist the transmission of water vapor through the exterior  
envelope.  
It is also necessary to provide for the removal of any water that may accumulate behind the  
exterior veneer. The code requires a means for draining water to the exterior that enters the  
assembly. The intent of the provision is to merely utilize the felt building paper or other water-  
resistive barrier, along with flashing, to drain the water to the outside, rather than provide an air  
space between the siding and the water-resistant barrier. Thus, the practice of placing siding  
directly over the barrier is acceptable, provided flashing is correctly installed to direct water  
within the wall assembly to the exterior.  
The code exempts the need for a weather-resistant wall envelope over concrete or masonry  
walls designed in accordance with Chapters 19 and 21, respectively. The International Building  
Code® \(IBC®\) requirements for weather coverings, flashings, and drainage are also not applicable  
where the exterior wall envelope has been tested in accordance with ASTM E331 and shown to  
resist wind-driven rain. In addition, where an exterior insulation and finish system \(EIFS\) is  
installed in accordance with Section 1407.4.1, the requirements of Section 1402.2 need not be  
followed.  
Testing has shown that the addition of a combustible water-resistive barrier can cause an  
exterior wall system to fail the NFPA 285 test, even if the wall had successfully passed the test  
prior to the addition of the barrier. Small-scale testing has shown that these types of materials can  
provide significant amounts of combustible fuel loading to a wall assembly. Therefore, exterior  
walls of those buildings required to have noncombustible exterior walls \(Types I, II, III, and IV\)  
must be tested in accordance with NFPA 285 where they contain a combustible water-resistive  
barrier and are over 40 feet \(12,192 mm\) in height. The use of this testing method is necessary to  
address the potential vertical and lateral flame spread that can occur either on or within exterior  
wall systems that contain combustible barriers. An exception is provided where the exterior wall  
covering is a specified noncombustible material, or where the barrier is limited in peak heat  
release rate, total heat release, effective heat of combustion, flame spread index, and smoke-  
developed index.  
Section 1403 Materials  
As most exterior wall coverings are permeable by moisture, the code requires that there should  
be a water-resistive barrier placed under the exterior wall covering and over the sheathing. The  
purpose of the barrier is to prevent moisture infiltration to the sheathing and subsequently the  
interior wall surfaces. The required water-resistive barrier is identified as at least one layer of No.  
15 felt complying with ASTM D226 for Type I felt, Type I or II vapor permeable flexible sheets  
per ASTM E2556, fenestration and curtain wall protection as set forth in ASTM E331, or other  
approved materials installed per the manufacturer's installation instructions. All necessary  
flashing must be installed as described in Section 1404.4 in order to complete the water-resistant  
envelope.  
Section 1404 Installation of Wall Coverings  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationExterior wall coverings are to be installed in accordance with the provisions of this section. Of  
primary concern are the types and thicknesses of the weather protection provided by the wall  
coverings. In addition, it is important that flashing be installed in those areas prone to leakage.  
Various types of veneer are addressed, including wood, masonry, stone, metal, glass, vinyl, fiber,  
and cement. The specifics for each veneer type are described in detail.  
1404.2 Weather protection. A broad range of exterior wall-covering materials is listed in Table  
1404.2 as being satisfactory when utilized as protection against the elements of nature. Covering  
types addressed include wood and particleboard siding, wood shingles, stucco, anchored and  
adhered masonry veneer, aluminum and vinyl siding, stone, and structural glass. For most of the  
30 types listed, the minimum required thickness for weather protection is mandated. In the case  
of particleboard and exterior plywood without sheathing, reference is made to Chapter 23.  
1404.3 Vapor retarders. In order to protect against condensation in framed exterior wall  
assemblies of buildings constructed in the specified Climate Zones, complying vapor retarders  
are mandated. Table C301.1 in the International Energy Conservation Code® \(IECC®\)  
establishes the appropriate Climate Zones in the United States based on counties. Those counties  
designated as Zones 5, 6, 7, and 8, as well as those classified as Zone 4 Marine must be provided,  
with exceptions, with either a Class I or II vapor retarder on the interior side of any exterior  
framed walls. The use of Class III vapor retarders is also acceptable provided such retarders are  
set forth in Table 1404.3\(3\) for the appropriate Climate Zones.  
In contrast, low-permeability vapor barriers are prohibited in warmer climate zones. By  
prohibiting the Class I and II retarders on the interior side of walls in Climate Zones 1 and 2, and  
the Class I retarders in Climate Zones 3 and 4 \(other than Marine 4\), the IBC helps to address the  
problem where warmer moist air from the exterior enters into the wall and then is trapped and  
condenses against the cooler interior side of the wall. See Figure 1404-1. It should be noted that  
the provision does not prohibit these particular vapor retarders in the specified climate zones, but  
that it is simply mandating that they are not placed on the interior side of the wall. If the better  
vapor barriers are installed on the interior side of the wall in the warmer climates, a reversed  
vapor retarder is essentially created, which can lead to the moisture being trapped and condensed  
within the wall.  
1404.4 Flashing. The code requires that all points subject to the entry of moisture be  
appropriately flashed. Roof and wall intersections, as well as parapets, are especially  
troublesome, as are exterior wall openings exposed to the weather, and particularly, those  
exposed to wind-driven rain. Even though the code may not cover every potential situation that  
might occur, it intends that the exterior envelope of the building be weatherproofed so as to  
protect the interior from the weather. Furthermore, for buildings of human occupancy, the  
interior must be sanitary and livable. Therefore, whether prescribed in the code or not, any place  
on the envelope of the building that provides a route for admission of water or moisture into the  
building is required to be properly protected.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1404-1 Vapor retarders.  
Section 1405 Combustible Materials on the Exterior Side  
# of Exterior Walls  
Exterior walls of buildings of Types I, II, III, and IV are typically required to be of  
noncombustible construction. However, it is common for some limited combustible elements to  
be installed on the exterior side of such exterior walls. Type V buildings are permitted to use  
combustible materials for the entire wall construction. Where the exterior walls of a building are  
covered on the exterior side with combustible materials, the materials must be in compliance  
with this section. The only exception is for plastics, which are regulated by Chapter 26. The  
installation of such materials in compliance with the code does not negatively impact the desired  
level of fire safety.  
The general requirements address the ignition resistance of the combustible wall coverings,  
based on the distance between the exterior wall and the lot line. Where the fire separation  
distance is 5 feet \(1,524 mm\) or less, the combustible wall covering must be subjected to the test  
method of NFPA 268 and exhibit no sustained flaming. As the exterior wall is moved farther and  
farther from the lot line, the tolerance to radiant heat energy need not be as great, allowing the  
use of alternative materials. Table 1405.1.1.1.2 identifies the tolerable level of incident radiant  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationheat energy based on fire separation distance.  
Section 1405.1.1 provides for the use of combustible wall coverings on otherwise  
noncombustible exterior walls, provided the building is limited to 40 feet \(12,192 mm\) in height  
above grade plane. The amount of such materials is also limited where the fire separation  
distance is 5 feet \(1,524 mm\) or less. The reductions from the general requirements are granted  
because of the restricted height and, in some cases, the limited amount of combustible materials.  
At a height exceeding 40 feet \(12,192 mm\), the use of combustible materials or supports is  
prohibited, except where the use of wood veneer and fire-retardant-treated wood is specifically  
allowed.  
Section 1406 Metal Composite Materials \(MCM\)  
Metal composite materials \(MCM\) consist of a thin, extruded plastic core encapsulated within  
metal facings. As the use of MCM continues to increase, it is important to provide detailed  
requirements addressing this unique building element. Many of the provisions are based on  
requirements from elsewhere in this chapter and Chapter 26. Although having some of the same  
characteristics as foam-plastic insulation, light-transmitting plastic, plastic veneer, and  
combustible construction, MCM used as exterior wall coverings are specifically regulated by this  
section.  
Where installed on exterior walls of buildings, MCM systems are regulated for surface-  
burning characteristics. In buildings of Type V construction, the flame-spread index cannot  
exceed 75 and the smoke-developed index is limited to 450. In buildings of Type I, II, III, or IV  
construction, the flame spread index is limited to 25. In such buildings required to have  
noncombustible exterior walls, the use of a thermal barrier is also necessary to separate the  
MCM from the interior of the building unless specifically approved by appropriate testing.  
Where MCM is installed on a Type I, II, III, or IV building to a height of greater than 40 feet  
\(12,192 mm\) above grade plane, the MCM must also comply with the acceptance criteria of  
NFPA 285.  
Section 1407 Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems  
Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems \(EIFS\) are nonload-bearing exterior wall coverings that  
are used extensively throughout North America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. The provisions of  
Section 1407 are primarily intended to reference the applicable ASTM standards that are specific  
to EIFS. Reference is made to E2273 Standard Test Method for Determining the Drainage  
Efficiency of Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems \(EIFS\) Clad Wall Assemblies, E2568  
Standard Specification for PB Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems \(EIFS\), and E2570  
Standard Test Method for Evaluating Water-Resistive Barrier \(WRB\) Coatings Used Under  
Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems \(EIFS\) for EIFS with Drainage. In addition to the several  
ASTM standards previously identified, reference is also made to various provisions found  
elsewhere in the IBC that are applicable to EIFS. Current ICC ES Acceptance Criteria further  
establish requirements for EIFS and related components, and numerous EIFS manufacturers hold  
evaluation reports to demonstrate code compliance.  
KEY POINTS

# ROOF ASSEMBLIES AND ROOFTOP STRUCTURES  
Section 1504 Performance Requirements  
Section 1505 Fire Classification  
Section 1506 Materials  
Section 1511 Rooftop Structures  
Key Points  
In addition to the requirements for roof assemblies and roof coverings, this chapter regulates  
roof insulation and rooftop structures. Rooftop structures include elements such as penthouses,  
tanks, cooling towers, spires, towers, domes, and cupolas. Roofing materials and components  
are regulated for quality as well as installation.  
The provisions in Chapter 15 for roof construction and roof covering are intended to  
provide a weather-protective barrier at the roof and, in most circumstances, to provide a fire-  
retardant barrier to prevent flaming combustible materials such as flying brands from nearby  
fires from penetrating the roof construction. This chapter is essentially prescriptive in nature  
and is based on decades of experience with the various traditional roof-covering materials.  
These prescriptive rules are very important to ensuring the satisfactory performance of the roof  
covering, even though the reason for a particular requirement may be lost. The provisions are  
based on an attempt to prevent observed past unsatisfactory performances of the various  
roofing materials and components.  
Those measures that have been shown by experience to prevent past unsatisfactory  
performance generally are included in the manufacturer’s instructions for application of the  
various roofing materials. In many cases, the manufacturer’s instructions are incorporated in  
this code by reference. The code intends, then, that they be followed as if they were part of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcode.  
The overriding safety need of roofs is resistance to external fire factors. In this regard, the  
necessary regulation is driven by Table 1505.1, as well as the appropriate standards for fire-  
retardant roof assemblies and roof coverings, including ASTM E108, UL 790, and ASTM  
D2898. Typically, a roof covering by itself cannot be a listed fire-retardant roof. Therefore, the  
regulations clearly separate assemblies and coverings to enforce construction of listed roof  
assemblies to the level at which listed wall and floor/ceiling assemblies are regulated  
Section 1504 Performance Requirements  
Roof decks and roof coverings must be able to withstand the effects of nature in a satisfactory  
manner. This section of the code regulates the performance of a roof against three concerns\:  
wind, weathering, and impact. For wind resistance, roofs must comply with this section and  
Chapter 16. Low-slope roofs must demonstrate that they are resistant to both weathering and  
impact damage by complying with the appropriate standards.  
The use of aggregate as a roof-covering material regulated based on specified conditions in an  
effort to reduce property loss that is due to high winds. Field assessments of damage to buildings  
caused by high-wind events have shown that aggregate blown from the roofs of buildings has  
exacerbated damage to other buildings because of breakage of glass.  
Table 1504.9 considers aggregate size, roof height, wind speed, and exposure category to  
determine the minimum required parapet wall height for aggregate-surfaced roofs. An  
engineering and scientific basis for roof design to prevent aggregate blowoff was achieved  
through the use of wind tunnel tests and subsequent field studies of hurricane damage. The  
provisions are based on wind speeds for blowoff and only deal with smaller aggregate used for  
the surfacing of built-up roofs and sprayed polyurethane foam roofs, both of which are different  
systems than ballasted roofs.  
Section 1505 Fire Classification  
As a minimum, the IBC® generally requires Class B or C roof coverings for most buildings.  
These are roof coverings that provide protection of the roof against moderate and light fire  
exposures, respectively. The various sizes of brands used for testing are shown in Figure 1505-1.  
These exposures are external and are generally created by fires in adjoining structures, wildfires  
\(brush fires and forest fires, for example\), and fire from the subject building that extends up the  
exterior and onto the top surface of the roof. Wildfires and some structural fires create flying and  
flaming brands that can ignite nonclassified roof coverings.  
The roof assembly classifications required by the code, which are related primarily to type of  
construction, are delineated in Table 1505.1.  
Section 1505 defines the following roof assemblies and roof coverings\:  
1\. Class A roof assemblies. Roof assemblies recognized as Class A are effective against  
severe fire exposures. A variety of prescriptive materials and assemblies are considered as  
Class A roof assemblies, as well as any roof assembly or roof covering tested and listed as  
Class A. Class A roof assemblies are permitted for use on all buildings, regardless of the  
building’s construction type.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. Class B roof assemblies. Class B roof assemblies are effective against moderate fire  
exposures and are considered appropriate for all types of construction. There are no  
prescriptive roof assemblies or roof coverings considered as Class B, as they must be  
listed as such. Consistent with the universal acceptance of Class A assemblies, Class B  
roof assemblies are also permitted for use on all buildings.  
Figure 1505-1 Brands for Class A, B, and C tests.  
3\. 4. 5. Class C roof assemblies. Buildings not required to be of fire-resistant construction—  
Types IIB, IIIB, and VB—are permitted to use Class C roof assemblies. Such assemblies  
are effective against light fire exposures.  
Fire-retardant-treated wood shingles and shakes. Where fire-retardant-treated wood  
shakes and shingles are components of Class A, B, or C roof assemblies, they must  
comply with the criteria of Section 1505.6. AWPA C1, All Timber Products-Preservative  
Treatment by Pressure Processes, is referenced as the standard for regulating the pressure  
treatment for fire-retardant purposes. In addition to the required markings that identify the  
shakes or shingles and their manufacturer, a label is mandated to identify the appropriate  
Class A, B, or C classification.  
Nonclassified roofing. Roof coverings that are considered nonclassified roof coverings are  
approved for use by the IBC on Group R-3 and U buildings where the roof is located at  
least 6 feet \(1,829 mm\) from all lot lines. These roof coverings have been shown by  
experience to provide the necessary resistance to weather as intended by the code when  
the qualities of the materials comply with the appropriate requirements.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation6\. Special-purpose roofs. These roofs are either of wood shingles or of wood shakes and are  
applied with a minimum ⅝ inch \(15.9 mm\) Type X water-resistant gypsum backing board  
or gypsum sheathing panel. The intent of the provisions for special-purpose roofs is to  
provide a roof covering that, although it may be ignited by flying brands, will not burn  
through to the interior of the building. Also, the special underlayment tends to prevent  
fires from the interior of the building from burning through and igniting the roof covering,  
which helps prevent flying brands. Special-purpose roofs are permitted in limited  
applications on buildings of Type IIB, IIIB, and VB construction by Footnote c to Table  
1505.1.  
Because of the inconsistent use of the terms roof assembly and roof covering throughout  
Chapter 15, there is confusion as to the proper use of combustible materials at the roof. Based on  
Item 4 of Section 603.1, combustible roof coverings that have an A, B, or C classification are  
permitted on buildings of Type I or II construction. This does not include the structural deck  
materials, which must be of noncombustible construction or fire-retardant-treated wood in  
compliance with Item 1.3 of Section 603.1. It would, however, permit the use of wood structural  
panels or foam plastic insulation boards as a part of the classified roof covering where used in  
combination with a noncombustible roof deck. Where a Class A, B, or C roofing assembly  
includes a combustible structural deck, other than fire-retardant-treated wood where permitted, it  
is limited to use on a building of Type III, IV, or V construction.  
Section 1506 Materials  
Certainly, roofing materials must comply with quality standards embodied in the IBC for  
Chapter 15. Furthermore, identification of the roofing materials is mandatory in order to verify  
that they comply with quality standards. In addition to bearing the manufacturer’s label or  
identifying mark on the materials, roof-covering materials are required by the code to carry a  
label of an approved agency having a service for inspection of materials and finished products  
during manufacture.  
Section 1511 Rooftop Structures  
Penthouses and other roof structures are regulated by the IBC as if they were appurtenances to  
the building rather than occupiable portions.  
In fact, if a penthouse is used for any purpose other than shelter of mechanical or electrical  
equipment, tanks, elevators, and related machinery, or shelter of stairways, or vertical shaft  
openings, the code requires that it be considered an additional story of the building.  
As intended by the IBC, roof structures are equipment shelters, equipment screens, platforms  
that support mechanical equipment, water-tank enclosures, and other similar structures generally  
used to screen, support, or shelter equipment on the roof of the building. This section also  
regulates towers and spires, which are addressed separately in Section 1511.5.  
The IBC regulates penthouses, roof structures, tanks, towers, and spires to prevent hazardous  
conditions that are due to internal and external fire concerns or structural inadequacy, and to  
ensure their proper use as equipment shelters.  
1511.2 Penthouses. The code does not regulate the height of penthouses and roof structures on  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationType I buildings. However, for buildings of other construction types, the code limits the height  
of penthouses and roof structures to 18 feet \(5,486 mm\) above the height of the roof, except  
where the penthouse is used to enclose a tank or elevator. In such cases, a maximum height of 28  
feet \(8,534 mm\) is permitted. As the aggregate area of all penthouses and roof structures is  
limited to one-third the area of the roof, the additional height permitted for penthouses and roof  
structures above that allowed by Section 504 for building height does not pose any significant  
fire- and life-safety hazard that is due to other restrictions that this section places on construction.  
See Figure 1511-1.  
Figure 1511-1 Penthouse limitations.  
Penthouses and other rooftop structures are also regulated by the exception to Section 504.3,  
where the requirements are based on the effect of a rooftop structure on the allowable height  
permitted for the entire building. Where applicable, the provisions from both Chapters 5 and 15  
are in effect, and where there is a conflict, the most restrictive condition will apply.  
As the code has reduced requirements for construction of penthouses and roof structures, it is  
logical that their use should be limited as specified in this section. Thus, if other uses are made of  
penthouses or other roof structures, it also seems appropriate that they should be constructed as  
would be required for an additional story of the building. It is the intent of the code that a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationpenthouse or roof structure complying with this section not be considered to create an additional  
story above that permitted by Section 504.  
If a rooftop structure qualifies as a penthouse, it is intended that the floor of the penthouse is  
only required to meet the roof provisions of Table 601. As an extension of this recognition, any  
fire-resistance-rated shaft that extends to or through the penthouse floor does not need to be  
protected at the penthouse floor line. Under both conditions, the floor of the penthouse is solely  
regulated as the building’s roof. Regarding any required means of egress from the penthouse, the  
provisions for an occupied floor are not applicable, nor are the requirements of Section 1006.3  
for an occupied roof. It would seem appropriate that the access provisions of the International  
Mechanical Code® \(IMC®\) for rooftop equipment also provide for adequate egress.  
1511.2.4 Type of construction. The intent of the code is that penthouses be constructed with the  
same materials and the same fire resistance as required for the main portion of the building.  
However, because of the nature of their use, the code does permit exceptions for exterior walls,  
roofs, and interior walls. Where the exterior walls of penthouses are more than 5 feet \(1,524 mm\)  
\[or in some cases 20 feet \(6,096 mm\)\] from the lot line, reductions in any required fire resistance  
are typically permitted. See Figure 1511-2. It is important to note that the intent of the exceptions  
is to reduce any required fire-resistance rating where applicable. Where the building's exterior  
walls and roof are permitted by other provisions of the code to have ratings less than those  
established in the exceptions, then those fire-resistance ratings set forth in the exceptions do not  
apply.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1511-2 Figure 1511-2 Penthouse construction.  
1511.5 Towers, spires, domes, and cupolas. The IBC intends that towers, spires, domes, and  
cupolas be considered separately from penthouses and other roof structures. The towers  
contemplated in this section are towers such as radio and television antenna towers, church  
spires, and other roof elements of similar nature that do not support or enclose any mechanical  
equipment and that are not occupied. As with penthouses and other roof structures, the code  
intends to obtain construction and fire resistance consistent with that of the building to which  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthey are attached. Under a variety of conditions, however, towers and similar elements are  
required to be constructed of noncombustible materials, regardless of the building construction.  
KEY POINTS  
• Roofs and roof coverings are addressed for both weather protection and fire retardancy.  
• The performance of a roof for weather protection is regulated against three concerns—  
wind, weathering, and impact.  
• The IBC generally requires roof coverings that provide protection for the roof against  
moderate or light fire exposures.  
• Roof assemblies and roof coverings are classified as either Class A, B, or C roofing  
assemblies; nonclassified roofing; fire-retardant-treated wood shingles and shakes; or  
special-purpose roofs.  
• Penthouses and other roof structures are regulated by the code as if they were  
appurtenances to the building rather than occupiable portions.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation INTRODUCTION TO THE STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS  
This introduction provides a brief background on the development of the International Building  
Code® \(IBC®\) structural provisions. During the original development of the IBC, the topic of  
adoption of standards by reference through identification of those portions of the standards likely  
to be frequently used by building officials, rather than by transcribing provisions from the  
standards into the body of the code itself, was the subject of lengthy debates. Primary arguments  
against transcribing standards have been that the practice increases the length of the code and  
that, more importantly, provisions of referenced standards become subject to change through the  
code change process. Legal ramifications of transcribing only portions of a standard into the  
code were also pointed out. In the end, the ICC chose to adopt applicable standards by reference.  
One of the many advantages to this approach is as development of design standards advance, the  
number of corresponding code revisions does not.  
The IBC references hundreds of structural standards, which are listed alphabetically in  
Chapter 35. Note that the year or edition of the standard is only shown in Chapter 35, not in the  
body of the code. For example, Chapter 16 frequently references ASCE 7 for the determination  
of load effects, but does not indicate which edition. Chapter 35 shows the edition \(year\) of the  
standard being referenced. Some of the main structural standards referenced in the 2021 IBC for  
loads and materials are shown in Table I-1.

Key Points  
This chapter provides background on the development of 2021 International Building Code®  
\(IBC®\) structural design requirements. Significant portions of Chapter 16 provisions related to  
load combinations and the determination of snow, wind, and seismic loads are included only  
by reference to ASCE 7 Standard Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for  
Buildings and Other Structures. Portions of these provisions that remain in the IBC relate to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationalternate methods and to the local geologic, terrain, or other environmental conditions that  
many building officials will wish to specify when adopting the model code by local ordinance.  
Numerical examples have been included where they serve to illustrate the design  
requirements.  
Section 1601 General  
Chapter 16, Structural Design, governs the structural design of IBC-regulated buildings,  
nonbuilding structures, and portions thereof. A building is defined in Section 202 as any  
structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any occupancy.  
The various types of structural loads specified by Chapter 16 are either gravity loads or lateral  
loads. Gravity loads specifically addressed are dead loads, live loads, snow loads, and rain loads.  
Lateral loads specifically dealt with are those due to wind, earthquakes, soil pressure, or flood.  
Loading conditions, such as uniformly distributed and concentrated live loads, impact loads, and  
most importantly, design load combinations, are also regulated by Chapter 16 provisions. Section  
1601 presents the scope of the chapter. Section 1602 lists notations that are used in structural  
equations that are provided throughout Chapter 16. Section 1603 specifies the minimum  
information that must be provided on construction documents. Section 1604 gives general design  
requirements and specifically addresses strength criteria and serviceability criteria, including  
deflection limitations, structural analysis, risk categories, and load tests. Section 1605 addresses  
the vital topic of how to apply design load combinations. This section references Chapter 2 of  
ASCE 7 for general load combination requirements, but also provides an alternate approach to  
the ASCE 7 provisions if desired by the engineer. Section 1606 specifies design dead loads.  
Section 1607 provides minimum uniformly distributed live loads and minimum concentrated live  
loads for various types of uses and occupancies. This section also permits a reduction of design  
live loads under certain conditions. Section 1608 specifies the design snow loads, largely by  
reference to Chapter 7 of ASCE 7. Section 1609 contains structural design requirements for wind  
loads, largely by reference to Chapters 26 through 30 of ASCE 7. Sections 1610, 1611, and 1612  
address soil lateral and uplift loads, rain loads, and flood loads, respectively. The rain load  
provisions of Section 1611 include reference to Chapter 8 of ASCE 7. Section 1613 is devoted to  
the seismic design of buildings and other structures and references Chapters 11 through 18  
\(excluding Chapters 14 and 16\) of ASCE 7. Section 1614 references Chapter 10 of ASCE 7 for  
atmospheric ice loads. Section 1615 prescribes tsunami load requirements per ASCE 7 Chapter 6  
for Risk Category III or IV structures located within tsunami inundation zones. Section 1616  
includes provisions intended to provide a minimum level of structural integrity in certain types of  
Risk Category III or IV high-rise buildings.  
Section 1602 Notations  
Both Chapters 16 and 21 include a “Notations” Section at the beginning of the Chapter. The  
purpose of this Section is to provide a definition for notations used in structural equations that  
are provided within that Chapter. When trying to understand what an equation is requiring in  
Chapter 16, it is often helpful to refer back to Section 1602.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 1603 Construction Documents  
This section details the items to be shown on construction documents.  
Construction documents are a part of the submittal documents required by Section 107, and  
the term is defined in Section 202. The indicated loads are required to be equal to or greater than  
the minimum loads required by the code. This information is useful to the building official in  
performing plan review and field inspection. It is also an extremely useful piece of information  
when additions or alterations are made to a structure at a later date. Each of the items indicated in  
Sections 1603.1.1 through 1603.1.9 is an important parameter in ensuring that appropriate live,  
snow, wind, earthquake, soil, flood, rain, and special loads are considered in the building’s  
structural system\(s\) design.  
The exception to Section 1603.1 simplifies the structural design information required for  
wood buildings constructed to the conventional light-frame construction provisions of Section  
2308\. A registered design professional is not required for the design of such buildings. However,  
many of the requirements of Sections 1603.1.1 through 1603.1.9 clearly would require the  
services of such a professional in order to provide the specified design data. The requirements in  
the exception are intended to provide adequate information for the building official to verify the  
structural design basis of wood-frame buildings built to these conventional construction  
provisions. For conventional construction, the IBC requires that both the floor and roof dead  
loads be listed on the construction documents along with the live loads.  
A key change to Section 1603.1.4 in the 2021 IBC is that designers are now required to not  
only list the design wind pressures for component and cladding materials, but they are now  
required to specify the applicable zones on the plans and provide dimensions. Adding the zones  
to the submittal information is intended to improve guidance for locating tighter nailing zones  
and other changes in construction requirements on a roof or wall surface.  
Section 1603.1.7 provides a pointer to Section 1612.4, which is titled “Flood Hazard  
Documentation.  
” Section 1612.4 requires statements to be included on the construction  
documents if certain flood-related situations exist. By including this pointer, the likelihood that  
these statements will be included on the plans is enhanced.  
Section 1603.1.8 requires that special loads that affect the design of the structure be listed.  
Examples are provided in the text, such as machinery or equipment that weigh more than the  
specified floor or roof loads. These special loads should be noted on the construction plans and  
their locations specified. Subsection 1603.1.8.1 specifically requires that the dead load for  
rooftop-mounted solar panels and their supports be noted on the plans.  
Section 1604 General Design Requirements  
1604.1 General. This section requires buildings and other structures and all portions thereof to  
be designed and constructed in accordance with the general strength and serviceability  
requirements contained in Section 1604.  
1604.2 Strength. The basic strength requirement is that buildings and structural systems be  
capable of supporting the factored loads without exceeding the applicable material strength limit.  
For structural elements designed using nominal rather than factored loads, the actual design  
stresses are not to exceed the applicable allowable material design stresses.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1604.3 Serviceability. The requirements for serviceability mean that structural systems and  
members must have adequate stiffness to limit deflection and lateral drift to an appropriate  
degree, based on the intended use. Specific requirements are given in Sections 1604.3.1 through  
1604.3.7\. Table 1604.3 contains deflection limits of structural members as a function of span and  
load type.  
Table 1604.3. Deflection Limits  
The general statement provided in the IBC is based on Section 1.3.2 of ASCE 7. ASCE 7  
requires that members have adequate stiffness to not only limit deflections and lateral drift, but  
also to consider vibration or any other deformations that could adversely affect the performance  
of the building. The IBC excludes reference to "vibration or any other deformations" for the  
following reasons\:  
1\. The code has no objectively defined standard for structural vibration. Acceptable  
vibration limits are frequently subjective and highly dependent on the specific  
requirements of occupants of a building. This information is not necessarily available to  
the building official.  
2\. It is impossible for the building official to anticipate everything that can “adversely affect  
the intended use and performance” of a building. Sections 1604.3.1 through 1604.3.7  
provide objectively defined deflection limits that are deemed to suffice for a wide range of  
structures. Limits more restrictive than these should be a matter of the design professional  
understanding the client’s needs and goals, but they are not typically part of a minimum  
life-safety building code. For example, there are situations in which sensitive computer,  
optical, or mechanical equipment require extraordinary measures to limit their movement  
or vibration. These measures are often very complex and well beyond the life-safety  
requirements of most structures.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1604.4 Analysis. The first two paragraphs are reproduced with minor modifications from Section  
1.3.5 of ASCE 7. The third paragraph is perhaps the most important when performing building  
plan reviews or inspections. This portion of the code highlights the importance of providing “  
…a  
complete load path capable of transferring loads from their point of origin to the load-resisting  
elements.  
” There are several load paths that must be considered with relation to any structure.  
The first is the gravity load path which considers all vertical loads such as dead, live, snow, rain,  
and ice. Figure 1604-1 shows the gravity load path for a vertical load on a floor slab. Notice that  
the load is picked up by multiple structural elements until it is finally transferred to the  
foundation soils through the footings. While this is a good example of a “complete load path,  
”  
Figure 1604-2 provides an instance where an incomplete load path is provided. Notice that in this  
figure support is not provided at the end of the floor girder at the wall and subsequently the  
vertical forces cannot be transferred through the footings and into the surrounding soils.  
Figure 1604-1 Vertical load path.  
The second load path that must be addressed in relation to every structure is the lateral load  
path. Horizontal loads are incurred due to seismic or wind events. While both wind and seismic  
forces are applied differently to a building, the lateral load path within the structure is the same  
for each. Horizontal forces are collected by the floor and roof diaphragms which then transfer  
these forces to the vertical resisting elements \(i.e., shear walls, moment frames, braced frames,  
and cantilevered columns\). These forces are then transferred from the vertical resisting elements  
down into the foundations and then into the surrounding soils. Figure 1604-3 shows how lateral  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationforces are applied to, and then move through, a structure.  
Another important load path deals with uplift loads. Uplift forces can be caused by wind and  
earthquake loads, hydrostatic pressure, or expansive soils. In certain cases, dead or live loads can  
be used to offset uplift loads. Specific load combinations account for these counteracting effects.  
Figure 1604-2 Incomplete vertical load path.  
One of the most important parts of building plan review and inspections is to ensure that a  
complete gravity and lateral load path are provided, as referenced in Section 1604.4. Careful  
review of plans and construction in the field is necessary to ensure that loads are transferred from  
one portion of the structure to the foundation.  
The structural analysis must be based upon “well-established principles of mechanics.  
” These  
principles are equilibrium, stability, geometric compatibility, and material properties. Although  
the code in general does not intend to specify the design method used by the engineer, it does  
intend that the design method be rational and follow standard design principles. Departures from  
this latter requirement can still be made based on the provisions of Section 104.11 when  
approved by the building official. For example, when the structural adequacy of a building or  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbuilding element does not lend itself to a rational analysis, full-scale testing may be the only  
reasonable way to determine its structural behavior. If the testing program shows that a certain  
building or element can safely resist the loads required by the code, the building official may  
approve the construction based on those test results.  
Section 1604.4 highlights two items for lateral loads that must be considered within the  
rational analysis that is provided. The first clarifies that the design professional must distribute  
lateral forces to vertical resisting elements based upon their rigidity and that increased forces due  
to torsion may need to be considered. This requirement is only for rigid diaphragms. The second  
item specifies that the analysis must show that the structure is able to resist all forces described in  
Chapter 16, and specifically addresses overturning, uplift, and sliding forces.  
Figure 1604-3 Lateral load path.  
1604.5 Risk category. This section and Table 1604.5 make a combined presentation of the risk  
categories of buildings and other structures. The risk category reflects the relative anticipated  
seriousness of consequence of failure from lowest hazard to human life \(Risk Category I\) to  
highest \(Risk Category IV\), and is used to relate the criteria for maximum environmental loads  
specified in the code to the consequence of loads being exceeded for structures and their  
occupants.  
Risk Category I contains buildings and other structures that represent a low hazard to human  
life in the event of failure, either because they have a small number of occupants or because they  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationhave a limited period of exposure to extreme environmental loading.  
Risk Category II contains all occupancies other than those in Risk Category I, III, or IV, and  
are sometimes referred to as ordinary for the purpose of risk exposure.  
Risk Category III contains those buildings and other structures that have large numbers of  
occupants, that are designed for public assembly, or in which physical restraint or other  
incapacity of occupants hinders their movement or evacuation. Therefore, these structures  
represent a substantial hazard to human life in the event of failure. Risk Category III also  
includes important infrastructure such as power-generating stations and water treatment facilities,  
where a failure may not create an unusual life-safety risk, but can cause large-scale economic  
impact and/or mass disruption of day-to-day civilian life.  
Table 1604.5. Risk Category of Buildings and Other Structures  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFor further clarity, Table 1604.5, in some cases, defines the risk categories based on the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationoccupancy classifications defined in Chapter 3 of the code. For instance, hospitals and health-  
care facilities are referred to as Group I-2 occupancies to specify the requirements of Risk  
Categories III and IV in order to make it clear that the care facilities having Group I-1  
classification are not intended to be assigned to Risk Category III or IV.  
Note that footnote “a” to Table 1604.5 makes a distinction between gross and net floor area  
for the calculation of occupant load to determine whether a building qualifies for Risk Category  
III because the occupant load exceeds 5,000. The calculation of the occupant load for the  
purpose of Table 1604.5 can be based on the net floor area even when Table 1004.1.2 requires  
gross floor area to be used. The net floor area, as defined in IBC Chapter 2, does not include  
corridors, stairways, elevators, closets, accessory areas, and structural walls and columns. This is  
because the two tables serve different purposes. Table 1004.1.2 provides minimum occupant  
loads for the purpose of egress design, and egress design is determined on a floor-by-floor basis,  
assuming that the maximum occupant load can occur on a certain floor at a given time. However,  
for the purpose of Table 1604.5, occupant loads are calculated for the whole building, and it is  
very unlikely that all floors of a building would have the maximum occupant load at the same  
time. This is similar to the reasoning that is behind permitting live load reductions in the code.  
Risk Category IV contains buildings and other structures that are designated as essential  
facilities such as hospitals and fire stations, which are intended to remain operational in the event  
of extreme loading. Also included are structures that are supplementary to Risk Category IV  
structures and required for the operation of Risk Category IV facilities during an emergency, for  
example, facilities to maintain water pressure for fire suppression. Structures holding extremely  
hazardous materials are also included in Risk Category IV because of the potentially adverse  
effect a release of those materials may cause to the public or the environment.  
1604.5.1 Multiple occupancies. In cases where there are multiple occupancies in a structure, the  
highest \(or most restrictive\) risk category is to be assigned to the structure unless the portions are  
structurally separated. In other words, when a lower risk category impacts a higher risk category,  
the higher risk category must either be structurally independent of the other, or the two must be  
in one structure designed to the requirements of the higher risk category. In cases where the two  
uses are structurally independent but are functionally dependent, both portions are required to be  
assigned to the higher risk category. To be a structural separation for seismic applications, there  
must be a physical separation \(not just an expansion joint\) that conforms to the requirements of  
ASCE 7 Section 12.12.3. If portions do not meet the minimum separation distance, then they are  
not structurally separated and must be designed and interconnected to act as one unit.  
An exception is provided to clarify risk category in buildings with storm shelters. As long as  
the shelter is constructed in accordance with ICC 500, the code does not require the design  
professional to consider the shelter occupancy in the risk category analysis, but rather allows the  
use of that space based upon the normal occupancy of the building to be considered. This  
exception does not apply if the space is a designated emergency shelter as listed in Table 1604.5.  
1604.6 In situ load tests. Whenever there is reasonable doubt as to the stability or load-bearing  
capacity of a completed building, structure, or portion thereof for the expected loads, an  
engineering assessment may be required by the building official. The engineering analysis may  
involve either a structural analysis or an in-situ load test, or both. See IBC Section 1708 for more  
details.  
1604.7 Preconstruction load tests. In evaluating the physical properties of materials and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmethods of construction that are not capable of being designed by approved engineering analysis,  
or that do not comply with applicable material design standards listed in Chapter 35, the  
structural adequacy must be predetermined based on the load test criteria given in Section 1709.  
1604.8 Anchorage. This section addresses anchorage of various components of a building to  
resist uplift and sliding forces that result from application of code-prescribed lateral forces. It  
intends that all members be tied together or anchored to resist uplift and sliding forces. The  
section differentiates between uplift and sliding forces to be resisted in general \(Section  
1604.8.1\) and the lateral support required for structural walls \(Section 1604.8.2\). Anchorage  
requirement of decks attached to an exterior wall is provided in Section 1604.8.3.  
Many observed failures of concrete or masonry walls in the 1971 San Fernando and the 1994  
Northridge earthquakes were attributable to inadequate anchorage between wall and roof  
systems. Although code requirements for anchorage to prevent the separation of heavy masonry  
or concrete walls from floors or roofs have been common in areas of high seismicity, they have  
been minimal or nonexistent in most other parts of the country. While a minimum wall  
anchorage requirement alone may not provide complete earthquake-resistant design,  
observations of earthquake damage indicate that it can greatly increase the earthquake resistance  
of buildings and reduce hazards in those localities where earthquakes may occur but are rarely  
damaging. Note that IBC Section 1604.8.2 refers to walls of all materials, not just concrete and  
masonry walls, as was the case in earlier editions of the IBC.  
If the wall being laterally supported is of hollow-unit masonry or a cavity wall, the required  
anchors must be embedded in a reinforced grouted structural element of the wall.  
1604.8.2 Structural walls. These requirements pertain to “structural walls,  
” which are  
essentially defined within this section to include load-bearing walls and shear walls. This section  
establishes the minimum wall anchorage capacity, based on the structure’s seismic design  
category \(SDC\). In accordance with provisions of ASCE 7, Section 1.4.4 is referenced for the  
determination of minimum anchorage forces in structures that are classified as SDC A. The  
referenced ASCE 7 provision provides minimum connection forces based on the consideration of  
a minimum level of structural integrity, and in the context of Section 1604.8.2, it means that wall  
anchorage needs to be adequate to carry a horizontal force equal to 0.2 times the wall weight  
tributary to the anchor, but not less than 5 psf \(0.239 kN/m2\) \(see Figure 1604-4\). For all other  
SDCs, the more stringent requirements in Section 12.11 of ASCE 7 are referenced. If the wall  
being laterally supported is of hollow-unit masonry or a cavity wall, the required anchors must  
be embedded in a reinforced grouted structural element of the wall.  
Properly anchoring structural walls to the floor and roof diaphragms is perhaps the most  
important mechanism provided to keep a structure from collapsing. In addition to the IBC, the  
International Existing Building Code® \(IEBC®\) has numerous provisions within it that require an  
existing building undergoing alteration to have the roof-to-wall connections evaluated. This  
evaluation can be triggered by reroofing the building or by undergoing a significant remodel.  
The IEBC focuses specifically on buildings that are in high-wind regions, older concrete and  
masonry buildings with flexible diaphragms, or unreinforced masonry buildings that are in areas  
of moderate- to high-seismicity.  
1604.8.3 Decks. When a deck is attached to an exterior wall, such attachment needs to be  
capable of resisting all vertical and lateral loads. As an example, the International Residential  
Code® \(IRC®\) provides prescriptive requirements for this attachment. For the vertical load  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationattachment, the IRC specifies how the ledger is to be attached to the exterior wall based on deck  
joist spans. For the lateral connection, the IRC requires that tension devices, such as hold-downs,  
be used to tie the deck joists to the primary structure’s framing members in at least two locations  
\(see Figure 1604-4\). Oftentimes, design professionals feel that the ledger attachment provides a  
sufficient vertical and lateral connection to the exterior walls; however, experience has shown  
that many decks pull away from the exterior walls as this ledger is typically attached directly to a  
rim/band joist as shown in Figure 1604-6. This highlights the need for a separate lateral  
attachment, similar to hold-downs at the ends of a shear wall, to keep the deck from pulling away  
from the primary structure \(see Figure 1604-5\).  
Figure 1604-4 Minimum anchorage of structural walls in SDC A.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1604-5 Deck lateral tension device.  
The IBC also clarifies that the vertical and lateral attachments must be verified during  
inspection. If these connections cannot be visually inspected, the deck will need to be capable of  
supporting itself without any attachment to the exterior wall.  
Figure 1604-6 Deck failure.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationWhen a deck is supported by an exterior wall at one end as well as by an intermediate support  
from a framing member \(Figure 1604-7\) such that a portion of the deck cantilevers beyond the  
intermediate support, two load cases need to be considered for the purpose of designing the  
attachment to the wall. In the first case, in addition to the dead load, the full span of the deck is  
subjected to the live load or the snow load, whichever is higher. This load case provides the  
maximum possible downward reaction in the wall attachment.  
In the second load case, only the cantilevered portion of the deck is subjected to the live load  
or the snow load in order to obtain the maximum uplift force in the wall attachment. In both  
cases, loads need to be combined in accordance with Section 1605 of the IBC.  
Figure 1604-7 Application of live/snow load on a cantileverd deck.  
1604.9 Wind and seismic detailing. The forces induced on a structure by a seismic event are the  
result of motions in the ground on which it rests. The response \(i.e., the magnitude and  
distribution of forces and displacements\) of a structure resulting from such ground motion is  
influenced by the properties of both the structure and the foundation, as well as the character of  
the exciting motion.  
A simplified picture of the behavior of a building during an earthquake is illustrated in Figure  
1604-8\. As the ground on which the building rests is displaced, the base of the building moves  
with it. However, the inertia of the building’s mass resists this motion and causes the building to  
suffer a distortion \(greatly exaggerated in the figure\). This distortion wave travels along the  
height of the structure in much the same manner as a stress wave in a bar with a free end. The  
continued shaking of the base causes the building to undergo a complex series of oscillations.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1604-8 Behavior of building during an earthquake.  
It is important to draw a distinction between forces that are due to wind and those produced  
by earthquakes. Occasionally, even engineers tend to think of these forces as belonging to the  
same category just because codes specify design wind as well as earthquake forces in terms of  
equivalent static forces. Although both wind and earthquake forces are dynamic in character, a  
basic difference exists in the manner in which they are induced in a structure. Whereas wind  
loads are external loads applied and, therefore, proportional to the exposed surface of a structure,  
earthquake forces are essentially inertia forces. The latter results from the distortion produced by  
both the earthquake motion and inertial resistance of the structure. Their magnitude is a function  
of the mass of the structure rather than its exposed surface. Also, in contrast to the structural  
response to essentially static gravity loading or even to wind loads, which can often be validly  
treated as static loads, the dynamic character of the response to earthquake excitation can seldom  
be ignored. Thus, although in designing for static loads one would feel greater assurance about  
the safety of a structure made up of members of heavy section, in the case of earthquake loading,  
a stiffer and heavier structure does not necessarily represent the safer design.  
When a structure responds elastically to ground motions during a severe earthquake, the  
maximum response accelerations may be several times the maximum ground acceleration and  
may depend on the mass and stiffness of the structure and the magnitude of the damping. It is  
generally uneconomical, and also unnecessary, to design a structure to respond in the elastic  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrange to the maximum earthquake-induced inertia forces. Thus, the design seismic horizontal  
force recommended by codes is generally less than the elastic response inertial forces induced by  
a major earthquake \(the design earthquake ground motion is defined in Section 1613\).  
Experience has shown that structures designed to the level of seismic horizontal forces  
required by current codes can survive major earthquake shaking. This is because of the ability of  
well-designed structures to dissipate seismic energy by inelastic deformations in certain localized  
regions of structural members. Decrease in structural stiffness caused by accumulating damage  
and soil-structure interaction also helps at times. The level of seismic design forces  
recommended in building codes implies that the critical regions of inelastically deforming  
members should have sufficient inelastic deformability to enable the structure to survive without  
collapse when subjected to several cycles of loading well into the inelastic range. This means  
avoiding all forms of brittle failure and achieving adequate inelastic deformability by the  
yielding of certain localized regions of certain members \(or of connections between members\) in  
flexure, shear, or axial action. This is precisely why the materials chapters \(Chapters 19, 21, 22,  
and 23\), reference design standards that provide detailing requirements and other limitations that  
go hand in hand with the code-prescribed seismic forces. The design earthquake forces \(Chapter  
16\) and the detailing requirements and other restrictions of the materials chapters form an  
integral package for seismic design.  
Wind and earthquake effects are not considered to occur simultaneously on the structure in  
U.S. design practice. Section 1605 and ASCE 7 contain gravity load combinations, combinations  
of gravity and wind loads, as well as combinations of gravity loads and earthquake forces.  
Design of every critical section of every structural member must be done considering all of these  
load combinations. If the gravity and wind load combinations produce demands that are closer to  
the design strength of a section than do the combinations of gravity loads and earthquake effects,  
then wind rather than earthquakes govern the design of that section. If wind loads are largest for  
every critical section of a structure, then wind governs the design of that entire structure.  
However, seismic detailing requirements of the materials chapters still need to be applied.  
Theoretically, it could be argued that if wind effects were larger than unreduced earthquake  
effects \(earthquake effects corresponding to the elastic response of the structure to the design  
earthquake\), then the detailing requirements of the code could be dispensed with. However, even  
that would not be allowed by the IBC. Totally irrespective of the severity of wind effects, the  
SDCs defined in Section 1613.2.5 determine the applicability of the seismic detailing  
requirements. The SDCs are used in the code, irrespective of the severity of wind effects, to  
determine permissible structural systems, limitations on height and irregularity, components of  
the structure that must be designed for seismic resistance, and the type of lateral force analysis to  
be performed.  
1604.10 Loads on storm shelters. Section 423 of the IBC requires that storm shelters be  
provided for specific occupancies in areas subject to tornado wind speeds of 250 mph \(110 m/s\).  
This includes Group E occupancies \(\> 50 occupants\), 911 call stations, emergency operations  
centers, fire stations, police stations, and hospitals. Structural loads and load combinations for  
storm shelters shall be in accordance with ICC 500 \(Figure 1604-9\).  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1604-9 ICC 500-20.  
Section 1605 Load Combinations  
1605.1 General. The importance of load combinations in structural design cannot be overly  
emphasized. IBC Section 1605.1 notes that buildings, structures, and portions thereof must be  
designed to resist either strength or allowable stress design load combinations. IBC Chapter 16  
assists designers in determining appropriate dead, live, snow, wind, seismic, and other loads that  
will be applied to a structure, but that is just part of the equation. The designer must also account  
for the potential simultaneous application of these loads.  
Most structures will see most, if not all, of the loads noted above throughout their design life.  
These loads are applied to the structure at different times and to various magnitudes. As an  
example, it is not reasonable to require a designer to analyze a structure considering that the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationworst-case snow, seismic, and flood loads will act concurrently. For that reason, load  
combinations were developed that require consideration of a “portion” of different design loads  
acting concurrently on a structure or element. Load factors account for the reduced probability of  
simultaneous occurrence of transient live loads.  
Figure 1605-1 shows the strength design load combinations that are provided in ASCE 7  
Section 2.3.1. There are five basic load combinations provided in Section 2.3.1, which blend  
portions of dead, live, roof live, snow, rain, and wind loads. A designer must evaluate each load  
combination with the one that produces the highest load effect governing design of the building,  
structure, or portion thereof. While ASCE 7 Section 2.3 includes other load combinations for  
fluid loads, ice loads, lateral earth pressure, ground water pressure, and more, reviewing the  
basic load combinations in Figure 1605-1 will help clarify the importance of combining loads to  
find the governing combination that will control design of the structure or element.  
Figure 1605-1 ASCE 7 strength design load combinations.  
The design professional can choose to use one of three sets of load combinations when  
performing the analysis of a building, structure, or portion thereof. Those are \(1\) strength design  
load combinations, \(2\) allowable stress design \(ASD\) load combinations, or \(3\) alternate ASD  
load combinations. The strength design and ASD load combinations have been removed from the  
2021 IBC, and the IBC now refers the designer to ASCE 7 Sections 2.3 and 2.4 for those  
requirements. The alternative allowable stress design load combinations are still provided in  
Section 1605.2 of the 2021 IBC, with some slight modifications.  
If a designer chooses ASD, he or she is essentially assuring that the calculated load \(i.e.,  
required strength\) will be less than the material or component strength \(i.e., allowable strength\).  
After calculating the required strength, the designer then analyzes the structure or component and  
applies a safety factor to obtain the allowable strength. The safety factor that is used is not  
associated with the load combinations but is based on the specific material being used. The  
safety factor varies based on the type of force being applied \(e.g., axial, shear, bending moment\).  
These safety factors have been established over years of experience, testing, and historical data.  
In many cases, the safety factor is built into published allowable design values for structural  
elements.  
Strength design, also known as load and resistance factor design \(LRFD\), follows a slightly  
different path than ASD. When using LRFD, the designer still needs to show that the required  
strength is less than the strength of the structure or component. In LRFD, the term “available  
strength” or “reference resistance” is used instead of ASD’s “allowable strength.  
” Rather than  
utilize a safety factor, LRFD relies on resistance factors to determine the “available strength.  
”  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThese resistance factors vary for different material types as well as the type of load being applied  
\(e.g., bending, tension, compression\).  
Designers must be careful when analyzing a building or structure and mixing both LRFD and  
ASD methodologies. As an example, it is quite common for foundations to be designed using  
ASD, while the steel structure the foundations are supporting is designed using LRFD. Using  
different methods for these elements is quite common but requires that the design professional  
adjust applied loads accordingly. With that said, at no time should a designer mix both LRFD  
and ASD methodologies indiscriminately while designing a structural frame.  
1605.2 Alternative ASD load combinations. The IBC alternative ASD load combinations have  
existed since the initial 2000 IBC and were included in legacy codes. Through the 2018 IBC, the  
alternative ASD load combinations permitted the use of a one-third increase in allowable stresses  
when evaluating load combinations containing short-term transient loads including wind and  
seismic loads. The basic ASD combinations did not permit the reduction in loads, but applied a  
factor of 0.75 to transient loads, including live, snow, wind, and seismic loads, when more than  
one of these loads was considered simultaneously.  
The ASCE 7 load combinations have further permitted an increase in allowable stresses when  
a material, such as wood, has increased available strength under short-term loading, i.e., loads  
due to snow, rain, wind, or earthquakes. This increase is not intended to be used for the design of  
masonry, concrete, or steel structures, because the strength of these materials does not vary  
significantly with the duration of the load.  
Unfortunately, the one-third stress increase has routinely been applied incorrectly. To limit  
misuse of the stress increase, the omega factor, ω, was deleted from the alternative ASD load  
combinations in the 2021 IBC.  
Section 1606 Dead Loads  
1606.1 General. Dead loads consist of the weight of materials of construction incorporated into  
a building, including but not limited to walls, floors, roofs, ceilings, stairways, built-in partitions,  
finishes, cladding and other similarly incorporated architectural and structural items, and fixed  
service equipment, including the weight of cranes.  
To establish uniform practice among designers, the ASCE 7 Commentary Tables C3.1-1 and  
C3.1-2 provide an extended list of weights for commonly used building materials that can be  
useful to the designer and building official alike. While special cases will inevitably arise,  
authority is granted to the building official to deal with such cases.  
1606.2 Weights of materials of construction. Dead loads associated with the actual weight of  
construction materials are what most people think of when considering dead load. The next three  
sections serve as a reminder to both code officials and designers about dead loads that are often  
missed in a structural analysis.  
1606.3 Weight of fixed service equipment. The maximum weight of fixed service equipment is  
to be considered in design. Consider a storage tank on an elevated floor in a manufacturing  
facility. The analysis cannot simply assume that a tank will only be halfway filled the majority of  
the time and must consider the maximum load case.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1606.4 Photovoltaic panel systems. The weight of photovoltaic \(PV\) panel systems, their  
support, and ballast should be considered as dead load.  
1606.5 Vegetative and landscaped roofs. The weight associated with rooftop landscaping,  
including the weight of vegetation and saturated soils must be considered as dead loads in the  
analysis. This section also points out that rooftop hardscaping \(i.e., pavers, decomposed granite,  
etc.\) must be calculated as a dead load.  
Section 1607 Live Loads  
1607.1 General. Live loads are defined as loads produced by the use and occupancy of the  
building or other structure, and do not include construction or environmental loads such as wind,  
snow, rain, earthquake, flood, or dead loads.  
1607.2 Loads not specified. For occupancies and uses not specifically included in Table 1607.1,  
the method of determination of the design live load is subject to the approval of the building  
official. Extremely valuable information is provided in the commentary to ASCE 7, Tables C4.3-  
1 and C4.3-2, concerning determination of design live loads for occupancies not listed in Table  
1607.1.  
1607.3 Uniform live loads. This section charges the designer to use the unit live loads set forth  
in Table 1607.1 and specifies that these loads must be considered minimum live loads. In other  
words, floors must be designed for the maximum live loads to which they are likely to be  
subjected during the life of the building based on its intended use, but in no case should the  
design loads be less than those given in Table 1607.1. The commentary to ASCE 7 advises that  
in selecting the occupancy and use for the design of a building, the owner should consider the  
possibility of later changes of occupancy involving loads heavier than originally contemplated.  
The lighter loading appropriate to the first occupancy should not necessarily be selected, when  
an owner has reason to anticipate different uses for the building in the future. The owner’s  
planning should also consider the possibility of temporary changes in the use of a building as in  
the case of clearing a portion of dormitory space for a dance or other recreational activity. To  
help prevent floors from being overloaded, Section 106 of the code provides requirements for the  
posting of live loads. In addition, Section 106.3 makes it unlawful to place a load greater than the  
code permits on any floor or roof of a building.  
1607.4 Concentrated live loads. Many uses are susceptible to the movement of equipment,  
files, machinery, and so on. Therefore, the code requires that floors and roofs, which are listed in  
Table 1607.1, be designed for the indicated concentrated load placed on a space 2½ feet square  
\(762 mm by 762 mm\) whenever this load, on an otherwise unloaded floor or roof, produces  
stresses greater than those caused by the uniform loads required by the code. As this  
concentrated load can take many forms in the occupied structure, and as the structural engineer  
usually does not know in advance what form the load will take and how it will be applied, the  
best compromise to cover most situations is to consider the concentrated load to be applied  
through a rigid base 2½ feet square \(762 mm by 762 mm\). Note that the term “load effects”  
refers not only to member forces and the resulting stresses, but also to member deformations \(see  
deflection criteria in Section 1604.3\).  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1607.5 Partition loads. In those uses where partition arrangements are periodically reconfigured  
such as office buildings and flexible-plan school buildings, the code requires that the floor  
system be designed to support a partition live load of 15 psf \(0.72 kN/m2\). This partition load  
does not need to be considered where the floor live load is 80 psf \(3.83 kN/m2\) or greater. This  
requirement is irrespective of whether partitions are shown on the construction documents. The  
15 psf \(0.72 kN/m2\) value was arrived at by assuming 10-foot-high \(3,048 mm\) partition walls of  
wood or steel stud wall construction with ½-inch \(12.7 mm\) gypsum board on each side, and  
arranged in a square grid of 10-foot \(3,048 mm\) sides. This assumption was thought to provide a  
fairly conservative estimate of partition loading. However, the ASCE 7 Commentary also advises  
designers to consider a larger partition load if a higher density of partitions is anticipated. It  
should be noted that the uniformly distributed load of 15 psf \(0.72 kN/m2\) is considered by the  
code to be a live load. Thus, it should be included with other live loads in the load combinations.  
It should be noted that where the 15 psf \(0.72 kN/m2\) gravity load is used, ASCE 7 requires a  
minimum of 10 psf \(0.48 kN/m2\) to be added to the effective seismic weight.  
1607.6 Helipads. Minimum design loading criteria for helicopter landing surfaces includes\:  
1\. A minimum uniform live load.  
2\. The weight of the helicopter.  
3\. The landing impact effect of the helicopter.  
In Item 1, the uniform live load of 40 psf \(1.92 kN/m2\) is applied when the landing area is  
used by helicopters with a take-off weight not exceeding 3,000 pounds \(13.35 kN\). A study  
indicated that about 56 percent of all registered helicopters in the United States weigh less than  
3,000 pounds \(13.35 kN\), which is comparable to the weight of a small automobile. Considering  
the size of the helicopter landing area, the equivalent uniform load is actually in the range of only  
2.1 to 4.3 psf \(0.1 to 0.2 kN/m2\), meaning that the live load of 40 psf \(1.92 kN/m2\) is fairly  
conservative. For larger helicopters, a 60-psf \(2.87 kN/m2\) design live load would apply.  
Landing pads designed for 3,000 pound \(13.35 kN\) helicopters must be labeled with a “3” in the  
bottom right corner when viewed from the primary approach path.  
1607.7 Passenger vehicle garages. Garages and other areas where motor vehicles are stored are  
to be designed for concentrated loads or, alternatively, the uniform loads as specified in Table  
1607.1\. In the case of garages for storage of private pleasure-type vehicles, Section 1607.7  
prescribes a single 3,000-pound \(13.35 kN\) load over a 4.5-inch by 4.5-inch \(114 mm by 114  
mm\) area. For only mechanical parking structures without slab or deck for the storage of  
passenger cars, a load of 2,250 pounds \(10 kN\) per wheel is specified.  
1607.8 Heavy vehicle loads. This section provides criteria for addressing heavy vehicle loads—  
those with gross weights exceeding 10,000 pounds \(4,536 kg\). Where heavy highway-type  
vehicles have access onto a structure, this section requires that the structure be designed using  
the same code and requirements that are applicable to roadways and bridges in that jurisdiction.  
This loading could be the loading from AASHTO’s Bridge Design Specification, or the loading  
specified by the jurisdiction for elements such as lids of large detention tanks or utility vaults.  
The registered design professional should consult with the jurisdiction for design loads that are  
applicable.  
This section also establishes loading criteria for certain categories of heavy vehicle loads such  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationas fire trucks and other similar emergency vehicles—in addition to forklifts and other moveable  
equipment. As a precaution against overloading a structure, the maximum weight of the vehicles  
that are anticipated and used in the design should be posted by the owner or owner’s agent—see  
also Section 106.1.  
1607.9 Loads on handrails, guards, grab bars, and seats. The majority of this section is  
adapted from ASCE 7. These requirements are intended to provide an adequate degree of  
structural strength and stability to handrails, guards, grab bars, accessible seats and benches, and  
their attachments.  
1607.9.1 Handrails and guards. The basic requirement of this section calls for application of a  
50-plf \(0.73 kN/m\) design load to handrails and guards. The second exception allows the design  
load to be reduced from 50 to 20 plf \(0.73 to 0.29 kN/m\) for guards that are within a Group I-3,  
F, H, or S occupancy in an area that is not accessible to the general public and that has an  
occupant load of less than 50. These are the same occupancies listed in Exception 4 to Section  
1015.4, which are permitted to have larger openings in the guard.  
Also, in the first exception, the IBC clearly states that while one- or two-family dwellings are  
exempted from the requirement for a minimum distributed load of 50 plf \(0.73 kN/m\), the  
requirement for a single concentrated load of 200 pounds \(0.89 kN\) specified in Section  
1607.9.1.1 still applies. Guard components such as balusters, panel fillers, and guard infill must  
be designed to resist a 50 pound \(0.22 kN\) concentrated load per Section 1607.9.1.2.  
1607.9.2 Grab bars, shower seats, and accessible benches. The components listed in this  
section are those that are typically required in providing accessibility in accordance with Chapter  
11\. Where accessibility is required, conformance with ICC A117 Accessible and Usable  
Buildings and Facilities is mandated in Section 1102.1. ICC A117 determines where elements  
such as grab bars or shower seats must be provided. The design loading on these elements that is  
specified herein is also consistent with ADA Standards for Public Accommodations and  
Commercial Facilities.  
1607.10 Vehicle barriers. This section requires the application of a 6,000-pound \(26.70 kN\)  
design load that accounts for impact. Because of differing vehicle bumper heights, barrier  
configurations, and anchorage methods, the specified load must be applied over a range of  
heights so that the maximum load effects are determined for design of the barrier.  
1607.11 Impact loads. These provisions are adapted from ASCE 7. Where unusual vibration or  
impact forces are likely to occur, their effect may be to produce additional stresses and  
deflections in the structural system. This section requires that the structural design take these  
effects into account. Impact loads specifically listed in the IBC include elevators, machinery,  
facade and building maintenance attachments, and fall arrest or lifeline anchorages.  
1607.12 Reduction in uniform live loads. The live load reduction provisions of Section  
1607.12.1 are based on ASCE 7, while the alternative floor live load reduction provisions are  
based on legacy model codes. Small portions of a floor are more likely to be subjected to the full  
uniform load than larger floor areas. Unloaded or lightly loaded areas tend to reduce the total  
load on the structural members supporting those floors. In recognition that the larger the tributary  
area of a structural member, the lower the likelihood that the full live load will be realized, the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationspecified uniformly distributed live loads from Table 1607.1 are permitted to be reduced.  
The alternative floor live load reduction provisions, based on tributary floor area \(Figure  
1607-1\), is used for reducing floor live loads only. Roof live load reductions are covered in  
Section 1607.14.2.  
Figure 1607-2 illustrates the influence area concept. The influence area is considered to be the  
floor area over which the influence surface for structural effects is significantly different from  
zero.  
In the basic uniform live load approach of Section 1607.12.1, the permitted reduction is a  
function of the tributary area, AT , multiplied by the element factor, KLL. This factor is the ratio of  
the influence area \(AI\) of a member to its tributary area \(AT\), i.e., KLL = AI /AT .  
Table 1607.12.1 has established KLL values \(derived from calculated KLL values\) to be used in  
Equation 16-7 for a variety of structural members and configurations. KLL values vary for  
column and beam members having adjacent cantilever construction, and Table 1607.12.1 values  
have been set for these cases to result in live load reductions that are slightly conservative  
\(Figure 1607-3\). For unusual shapes, the concept of significant influence for structural effect  
needs to be applied.  
1607.12.1 Basic uniform live load reduction. Reductions in the minimum uniformly distributed  
live load are permitted, based on an influence area, KLL A T , of 400 square feet \(37.16 m2\) or  
more. Essentially, the influence area of a structural element is the total floor area surrounding the  
element from which it derives any of its loads. The basis for the permitted reduction is that in the  
design of structural elements with large influence areas, it is highly unlikely that the floors will  
be fully loaded over their entire area. The reduction of certain live loads is prohibited unless a  
specific exception applies—see Sections 1607.12.1.2 and 1607.12.1.3.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1607-1 Tributary areas.  
Live load reduction in excess of 50 percent is not permitted for columns or other structural  
elements \(such as bearing walls\) that support the loads of a single floor \(see Figure 1607-4\). In  
essence, this means that the influence area may not exceed 3,600 square feet \(334.4 m2\) in  
calculating the reduced unit floor live load. For columns or other structural elements that support  
two or more floors, the sum of the reduced live loads from all floors must not be less than 40  
percent of the sum of the unreduced live loads.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1607-2 Influence areas.  
1607.12.1.1 One-way slabs. This section allows live load reduction in one-way slabs—see Table  
1607.12.1 for KLL value of a one-way slab. Although both one-way and two-way slabs have the  
same KLL value of 1.0, this section imposes an upper limit on the slab width that can be used to  
calculate AT of a one-way slab as 1.5 times the slab span. This restriction is indicative of the  
lower redundancy in one-way slabs when compared to two-way slabs.  
1607.12.1.2 Heavy live loads. In the case of occupancies requiring relatively heavy minimum  
uniform live loads, such as storage buildings, several adjacent floor panels can be fully loaded.  
Field surveys indicate that rarely is any story loaded with an average actual live load of more  
than 80 percent of the average design live load. Thus, the ASCE 7 committee concluded that the  
minimum uniform live load should not be reduced for the floor and beam design, but that it may  
be reduced a flat 20 percent for the design of members supporting more than one floor. In  
Exception 1, the IBC further qualifies this allowance to require that the reduction be calculated in  
accordance with Section 1607.12.1, with the maximum reduction limited to 20 percent.  
The IBC also includes a second exception to the prohibition on reduction, permitting  
additional live load reduction for uses other than storage when the registered design professional  
can provide an acceptable substantiation for doing so. The rationale is that there can be uses  
other than storage where the maximum design live loads may exceed 100 psf \(4.79 kN/m2\), but  
the average load on members with large tributary areas may be less. For example, floors  
supporting heavy machinery may have very high uniform loads that are concentrated mostly over  
a small part of the floor area. This provision will allow the registered design professional to  
present to the building official a rational load reduction proposal if those scenarios apply. Since  
there are no specific criteria stated and the reduction is subject to the approval of the building  
official, this exception is very much like reiterating the concept of an alternative method of  
design as described in Section 104.11.  
1607.12.1.3 Passenger vehicle garages. There are no significant variations in the loads imposed  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationon these facilities, which are often fully loaded, thus the prohibition on live load reductions. An  
exception permits a 20-percent live load reduction for members supporting two or more floors.  
The reasoning is the same as provided for Section 1607.12.1.2.  
1607.12.2 Alternative uniform live load reduction. This section establishes a minimum  
tributary area of 150 square feet \(13.94 m2\) as the threshold for live load reductions computed  
from Equation 16-8. Figure 1607-4 provides a comparison of live load reductions calculated  
using the basic live load reduction of IBC Equation 16-7 and the alternative live load reductions  
of IBC Equation 16-8 for members supporting one floor. For members supporting more than one  
floor, higher reductions are permitted with both methods. Live loads in excess of 100 psf \(4.79  
kN/m2\) may not be reduced with two exceptions. First, the design live loads on columns  
supporting two or more floors may be reduced by 20 percent, and second, for usage other than  
storage, reduction is permitted when found acceptable by a registered design professional  
through rational analyses, as explained in Section 1607.12.1.2 above. Also, reduction is not  
permitted for passenger-vehicle garages except for a maximum 20-percent reduction for columns  
supporting two or more floors. An upper limit is also specified for the tributary width of a one-  
way slab for reduction calculations as 0.5 times the span of the slab, as explained in Section  
1607.12.1.1\. The maximum live load reduction permitted is 40 percent for members receiving  
loads from one floor level only and 60 percent for other members \(such as columns or transfer  
girders\).  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1607-3 Typical tributary and influence areas.  
Figure 1607-4 Uniform live load reduction comparison for members supporting one floor.  
Equation 16-8 was derived so that if a structural member supporting a tributary area of  
sufficient size to qualify for the maximum reduction allowed by the equation was subjected to  
the full design live load over the entire area, the overstress would not exceed 30 percent \(Figure  
1607-4\).  
It may be noted from Equation 16-9 that the maximum live load reduction is proportional to  
the ratio of dead load to live load. Therefore, for heavy framing systems, the reduction is  
permitted to be greater than it would be for lighter framing systems. This reflects the thinking  
that for a given magnitude of overload on a structural system, the system with the heavier dead  
load is overstressed proportionately less than one with a lighter dead load. For example, if a floor  
system weighing 30 pounds per square foot \(psf\) \(1.44 kN/m2\) and designed for a live load of 40  
psf \(1.92 kN/m2\) was subjected to a 20-psf \(0.96 kN/m2\) overload, the amount by which the  
structural system would be overloaded is about 30 percent, assuming the system was designed to  
support just the minimum design live load of 40 psf \(1.92 kN/m2\). If this floor had a dead load of  
60 psf \(2.87 kN/m2\), the overload would be only 20 percent, again assuming that the system was  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdesigned to support just the 40-psf \(1.92 kN/m2\) live load.  
1607.13 Distribution of floor loads. Where loads are uniformly distributed on continuous  
structural members, they shall be arranged so as to create maximum bending moment in any  
given critical section. This may require a design to consider so-called skip loading or alternate  
span loading, as shown in Figure 1607-5.  
Figure 1607-5 Alternatespan loading for continuous beams.  
1607.14 Roof loads. In addition to dead and live loads, this section is a reminder that the design  
of a roof must also consider the effects of environmental loads such as rain, wind, snow, and  
earthquakes.  
1607.14.1 Distribution of roof loads. This is nearly identical to Section 1607.12 \(see discussion  
above\). However, the provision applies only when the uniform roof live loads are reduced to less  
than 20 psf \(0.96 kN/m2\). ASCE 7 Section 7.5 is referred to for consideration of partial loading  
of snow.  
1607.14.2 Reduction in uniform roof live loads. The reduced load values that are permitted are  
meant to act vertically upon the projected area and have been selected as minimum roof live  
loads, even in localities where little or no snowfall occurs. This is because it is considered  
necessary to provide for occasional loading that is due to the presence of workers and materials  
during maintenance or repair operations. The live load reduction for roofs is a function not only  
of tributary area, but also of the slope of the roof. This is because it becomes less probable that  
the loads on a roof member will reach the maximum levels as the slope of the roof increases. It is  
also worth noting that no live load reduction is allowed for awnings and canopies consisting of  
fabric construction supported by a lightweight rigid skeleton structure—see Item 27 of Table  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1607.1.  
Where the design roof snow load exceeds the minimum roof live load in the applicable load  
combination\(s\), the snow load is to be used for design of the roof. Only the greater of the roof  
load value established by the minimum roof live load or the design snow load determined as  
indicated above is required to be applied to the roof. It should be noted that for the roofs covered  
in this section the absolute minimum roof live load is 12 psf \(0.58 kN/m2\), as indicated by the  
limits in Equation 16-10.  
1607.14.2.2 Occupiable roofs. Since roofs that are occupiable are designed for live loads that  
are commensurate with the intended use—see Item 27 of Table 1607.1—these roof live loads  
may be reduced in accordance with the live load reductions allowed by Section 1607.12.  
1607.14.3 Awnings and canopies. For the design of awnings and canopies, snow loads and wind  
loads, as specified in Sections 1608 and 1609, need to be considered in addition to the live loads  
specified in Item 27 of Table 1607.1.  
1607.14.4 Photovoltaic panel systems. With the increasing use of PV solar panels and modules  
mounted on rooftops, there is a need for specific loading requirements related to these panels.  
Several new sections add specific design requirements for roof structures supporting PV solar  
panels and modules. Roofs that support solar panels must be designed for the full panel and  
ballast dead load, including concentrated loads from support frames in combination with roof  
live load, and any other applicable loads, including any loads due to snow drifting.  
1607.15 Crane loads. All craneways and supporting construction must be designed and  
constructed in compliance with this section, which parallels the crane load criteria of ASCE 7.  
The crane live loads depend on\:  
• Type of crane \(monorail, cab-operated, pendant-operated, hand-geared\)  
• Rated capacity of crane  
• Maximum wheel loads  
Design lateral, longitudinal, and vertical forces are provided in terms of the above. These live  
loads are to be applied simultaneously to the structural system of the craneway, including  
runway beams, connections, support brackets, cross-bracing, columns, and foundations. The  
vertical impact force accounts for the vibration effect of the crane bridge movement and the  
movement of the lifted load. The lateral force \(perpendicular to the runway girder\) results from  
acceleration or deceleration of the trolley and the lifted load. The longitudinal force \(parallel to  
the runway girder\) results from the acceleration or deceleration of the bridge or the lifted load.  
1607.16 Interior walls and partitions. The intent of this section is to provide sufficient  
strength, stiffness, and durability of wall framing and wall finish, so that a minimum level of  
resistance would be available to nominal impact loads that commonly occur in the use of a  
facility and due to HVAC pressurization. All interior walls and partitions must be capable of  
resisting a minimum lateral force of 5 psf \(0.240 kN/m2\).  
1607.16.1 Fabric partitions. Fabric partitions are defined in Section 202 as follows\:  
FABRIC PARTITIONS. A partition consisting of a finished surface made of fabric, without a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcontinuous rigid backing, that is directly attached to a framing system in which the vertical  
framing members are spaced greater than 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) on center.  
The definition clearly differentiates them from other more traditional-type partitions, which  
include partial-height office partitions that contain rigid panels finished with fabric and attached  
to a rigid frame. In the case of a fabric partition, there is no rigid panel to which the fabric is  
attached. The fabric simply spans the open space between the rigid frame over which it is  
stretched and attached. In the definition, it states that the vertical framing members are spaced  
greater than 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) on center, again to differentiate this type of partition from a more  
traditional partition where the vertical framing members are spaced at 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) on  
center or less. Typically, these partitions are not intended to be full \(ceiling\) height, so they  
would normally not be attached directly to the ceiling. They are usually supported by the floor,  
except under conditions where, because of the layout and the height of the ceiling, it may be  
more appropriate to hang the partition from the ceiling grid or use a combination of floor  
supports and ties to the ceiling grid or a special structural ceiling grid designed to support such  
partitions. Figure 1607-6 shows some examples of fabric partitions.  
The intent of the concentrated load of 40 pounds \(0.176 kN\) was to ensure that the partition  
does not tip over if someone were to inadvertently lean up against the frame or the fabric, and  
that a person inadvertently leaning against the fabric would not cause the fabric to tear and the  
person to fall abruptly. In the case of the 5-psf \(0.24 kN/m2\) horizontal load, it was decided that 5  
psf \(0.24 kN/m2\) is to be distributed by calculating the total load based on the area of the fabric  
and then having that load distributed proportionally over the horizontal and vertical structural  
framing members of the partition. Thus, the framing system, in effect, will be resisting the total  
horizontal distributed load of 5 psf \(0.24 kN/m2\) even though 5 psf \(0.24 kN/m2\) is not applied  
over the field of the fabric between the supports.  
Figure 1607-6 Examples of fabric partitions.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1607.16.2 Fire walls. IBC Chapter 7 requires fire walls to be structurally stable, which allows  
for structural collapse on either side without collapse of the wall. The IBC indicates that fire  
walls are required to resist a 5-psf \(0.24 kN/m2\) horizontal ASD load.  
1607.17 Fixed ladders. Ladders are to be designed to resist a single 300-pound \(1.33-kN\)  
concentrated load while each side rail extension should be designed for a single concentrated  
load of 100 pounds \(0.445 kN\). This section also highlights that ship’s ladders should be  
designed to resist the loads prescribed for stairs in Table 1607.1.  
1607.18 Library stack rooms. While Table 1607.1 prescribes uniform and concentrated live  
loads for libraries, this section of the code clarifies that those load provisions assume a maximum  
book stack height of 90 inches \(2,286 mm\), shelf depth of no more than 12 inches \(305 mm\), and  
aisles separating double-faced book stacks having a minimum width of 36 inches \(914 mm\).  
Should conditions exceed any of these limitations, the live loads used for the structural analysis  
should be approved by the building official.  
1607.19 Seating for assembly uses. This section refers the designer to the ICC Standard for  
Bleachers, Folding and Telescopic Seating and Grandstands \(ICC 300\) for the structural design  
requirements associated with those structures and then prescribes requirements for the horizontal  
sway loads that must be considered in relation to fixed seats provided in stadiums and arenas. In  
this instance, stadiums with fixed seats must consider the standard live loads prescribed in  
Section 1607 in addition to the horizontal sway loads stipulated in Section 1607.19.1.  
1607.19.1 Horizontal sway loads. Stadium or arena fixed seats require design to resist 24  
pounds per linear foot \(plf\) \(0.35 kN/m\) parallel to each row of seats and 10 plf \(0.15 kN/m\)  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationperpendicular to each row. These loads are not to be applied simultaneously.  
1607.20 Sidewalks, vehicular driveways, and yards subject to trucking. This section requires  
any flatwork that will be subject to truck loading to consider an appropriate uniform live load as  
well as the concentrated wheel load listed in Table 1607.1 applied over an area of 4.5 inches by  
4.5 inches \(114 mm by 114 mm\).  
1607.21 Stair treads. The concentrated stair live load noted in Table 1607.1 should be applied  
over an area of 2 inches by 2 inches \(51 mm by 51 mm\) and does not need to be considered to  
act at the same time as the prescribed uniform live load.  
1607.22 Residential attics. This section describes three separate attic live loads that could exist.  
The first is listed as an “uninhabitable attic without storage,  
” then there is an “uninhabitable attic  
with storage,  
” and finally “attics served by stairs.  
”  
1607.22.1 Uninhabitable attic without storage. Table 1607.1 notes that uninhabitable attics  
without storage should be designed considering a live load of 10 psf \(0.48 kN/m2\). These are  
attics where the clear height between the rafter and ceiling joists, or the clear height between top  
and bottom chord of trusses \(considering web configurations\), is less than 42 inches \(1,067 mm\).  
1607.22.2 Uninhabitable attic with storage. Figure 1607-7 shows the requirements for  
uninhabitable attics with storage. This occurs when a clear height of 42 inches \(1,067 mm\) is  
provided between a joist and a rafter, or if a box having a height of 42 inches \(1,067 mm\) and  
width of 24 inches \(610 mm\) can be accommodated between the webs of two adjacent trusses. In  
this instance the bottom chord of the truss, or the ceiling joist, must be designed for a uniform  
live load of 20 psf \(0.96 kN/m2\). Attics with storage, or those that can be accessed by a pull-  
down stair, must be considered habitable and use the appropriate live load per Table 1607.1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1607-7 Uninhabitable attics with storage.  
1607.22.3 Attics served by stairs. Attic spaces accessible by stairways other than the pull-down  
type need to be designed to support the habitable attic and sleeping room live load of at least 30  
psf \(1.44 kN/m2\).  
Section 1608 Snow Loads  
The snow load provisions reference ASCE 7 Chapter 7. Only the provisions regarding  
determination of ground snow loads in the contiguous United States, Alaska, and Hawaii are  
contained in the code, which many building officials may wish to specify when adopting the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmodel code by local ordinance. Based on the provisions in the IBC and ASCE 7, Figure 1608-1  
has been developed to show design snow load determination. The variables that must be  
determined for design snow load calculations include ground snow load, exposure factor, thermal  
factor, and importance factor. Other considerations include a rain-on-snow surcharge, partial  
loading, and ponding instability from melting snow or rain on snow. The discussions about these  
provisions are presented in the same order as shown in Figure 1608-1.  
Figure 1608-1 Snow load provisions.  
1608.1 General. The IBC stipulates in this section that design snow loads be determined in  
accordance with ASCE 7 Chapter 7. Requiring that the design roof load shall not be less than the  
roof live loads that are determined in Section 1607 merely restates what is required by the load  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcombinations of Section 1605.  
Figure 1608-2 ATC Hazards by Location web application for wind loads.  
1608.2 Ground snow loads. Figures 1608.2\(1\) and 1608.2\(2\) for the contiguous United States  
and Table 1608-2 for Alaska give the ground snow loads to be used in determining design snow  
loads for roofs. The IBC states\: “Snow loads are zero in Hawaii, except in mountainous regions  
as approved by the building official.  
” The snow loads on the maps have a 2-percent annual  
probability of being exceeded \(a 50-year mean occurrence interval\). The mapped values indicate  
ground snow loads in pounds per square foot \(psf\). In mountainous areas, the map indicates the  
highest elevation up to which it is appropriate to use a given snow load. For elevations higher  
than indicated on the map, a site-specific case study is necessary to determine the appropriate  
ground snow load. Areas identified as CS on the map require site-specific case studies  
irrespective of elevation.  
The 2021 IBC refers directly to ASCE 7 Chapter 7 for specific snow loads for the states of  
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, and New Hampshire and does  
not provide ground snow load information for these states in Figures 1608.2\(1\) and 1608.2\(2\).  
Regardless of whether one is selecting the ground snow load from the IBC figures, ASCE 7 or a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcase study, the design professional should always verify the snow load with the local building  
official prior to completing their design of the building or structure.  
The Applied Technology Council has created a web-based tool titled “Hazards by Location”  
that can be used to determine the appropriate ground snow load for a particular site. In addition,  
this tool provides wind, tornado and seismic ground motion information for the location in  
question. A user simply needs to input the project address or latitude and longitude coordinates  
for the site. Figure 1608-2 shows this web-based application that can be accessed at\:  
hazards.atcouncil.org.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.3 Flat Roof Snow Loads. This section converts the ground snow load, pg, to  
flat roof snow load, pf . This calculation utilizes an exposure factor, a thermal factor, as well as  
the importance factor. In Section 7.4, the flat roof snow load is used to determine the sloped roof,  
or balanced, snow load. It does so by applying the roof slope factor Cs. When the value of Cs is  
1.0, then the snow load that applies is essentially the flat roof snow load.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.3.1 Exposure Factor, Ce. The roof exposure factor depends on the wind  
exposure category \(or terrain category\) as well as the exposure of the roof, as described in the  
footnotes to Table 7.3-1. The roof snow load is higher for a sheltered site such as a wooded area  
than it is for an exposed site that is flat and open. Table 7.3-1 footnotes require that the terrain  
category and roof exposure condition chosen shall be representative of the anticipated conditions  
during the life of the structure. An exposure is required to be determined for a roof of each  
structure.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.3.2 Thermal Factor, Ct.  
The thermal factor accounts for the heat that is  
transmitted from the interior of the structure, which tends to reduce the snow depth on the roof.  
Structures that are kept just above freezing, that are unheated, or freezer buildings have a Ct  
factor of greater than 1.0 per ASCE 7 Table 7.3-2 since snow will stay on the roof of these  
structures longer than it would on that of a heated structure.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.3.3 Importance Factor, Is.  
The snow load importance factor attempts to  
address the need to relate design loads to the consequences of failure. Roofs of most structures  
having normal occupancies and functions are designed with an importance factor of 1.0, which  
corresponds to unmodified use of the statistically determined ground snow load for a 2-percent  
annual probability of being exceeded \(50-year mean recurrence interval\). Lower and higher risk  
situations are established using the importance factors for snow loads, which range from 0.8 to  
1.2\. The factor of 0.8 corresponds to an annual probability of being exceeded of about 4 percent  
\(about a 25-year mean recurrence interval\). The factor of 1.2 is nearly that for a 1-percent annual  
probability of being exceeded \(about a 100-year mean recurrence interval\). This factor is  
explained further in ASCE 7 Commentary Section C7.3.3.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.3.4 Minimum Snow Load for Low-Slope Roofs, pm. This section accounts  
for a number of situations where the ground-to-roof conversion factor of 0.7 as well as the  
factors Ce and Ct may underestimate the snow load, such as the load resulting from a single  
storm in an area where the ground snow load is less than 20 psf \(0.96 kN/m2\). This section also  
includes the clarification that it is not necessary to combine the minimum snow load with drift  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationload and sliding snow load, as well as unbalanced or partial snow loads. When this minimum  
snow load is applicable, it is considered a separate snow load case.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.4 Sloped Roof Snow Loads, ps. The design snow load for a sloped roof is  
equal to the flat roof snow load multiplied by a roof slope factor that is given by Section 7.4.1 for  
warm roofs, Section 7.4.2 for cold roofs, Section 7.4.3 for curved roofs, and Section 7.4.4 for  
multiple folded plate, sawtooth, and barrel vault roofs. The standard notes, parenthetically, that  
this sloped roof snow load is the “balanced” snow load. Section 7.6 further clarifies that the  
balanced and unbalanced snow loads are analyzed separately.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.5 Partial Loading. In many situations, a reduction in snow load on a portion  
of a roof by wind scour, melting, or snow removal operations may simply reduce the stresses in  
the supporting members. However, in other cases, removal of snow from an area may induce  
heavier stresses in the roof structure than can occur when the entire roof is loaded. Cantilevered  
roof joists are a good example; removing half the snow load from the cantilevered portion  
increases the bending stress and deflection of the adjacent continuous span. In some situations,  
adverse stress reversals may result. This section requires consideration to be given in design to  
those adverse situations.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.6 Unbalanced Roof Snow Loads. Snow on the roof of a building rarely  
accumulates evenly. The code intends that the designer investigate conditions of imbalance by  
requiring that roof designs consider unbalanced snow loading. One case would be the loading of  
one slope of a gable roof with snow while the other slope is unloaded \(Figure 1608-3\). If this  
creates a less favorable condition in the design of the roof structural members, then it is the  
loading to be considered. This type of loading covers the case where the snow may have been  
removed from one side of the roof because of sliding or melting.  
Figure 1608-3 Potential snow accumulation, gable roofs with sidesheds.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.7 Drifts on Lower Roofs \(Aerodynamic Shade\). It is extremely important  
to consider localized drift loads when designing roofs, because drifts onto lower roofs are a  
common cause of roof failures after a heavy snow \(Figure 1608-3\). This section separately  
addresses windward drift that forms on the windward side of a high-bay wall area, and leeward  
drift that forms on the leeward side of a high-bay wall area. It provides the formulations for  
determining drift load intensity and prescribes which portion of the lower roof is subject to drift  
loading.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.8 Roof Projections and Parapets. Solar panels, mechanical equipment,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationparapet walls, and penthouses are examples of roof projections that may cause windward drifts  
on the roof around them. The drift-load provisions of this section cover most of these situations  
adequately. Drift loads are not required when the side of the projection is less than 15 feet \(4,572  
mm\) or when the projection has a clear distance of at least 2 feet \(610 mm\) to the height of the  
balanced snow load as shown in Figure 1608-4.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.9 Sliding Snow. In cold climates where significant snow loads can  
accumulate on the roof, the design professional must pay special attention to areas where sliding  
snow can occur. Sliding snow is where a mass of snow from an upper roof falls onto a lower roof  
or another structure such as a deck. As shown in Figure 1608-5, the sliding snow load from an  
upper roof should be distributed over an area of 15 feet \(4,572 mm\) in accordance with Section  
7.9 of ASCE 7. Sliding snow has been the cause of many structural failures and the potential for  
sliding snow should be addressed in the design.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.10 Rain-on-Snow Surcharge Load. This load accounts for the increased  
weight of snow after it rains on the snow. Research has shown that the major portion of the rain-  
on-snow surcharge load comes from the rainwater flowing along the slope of the roof by  
percolating through the snow layer immediately above the roof. Thus, the surcharge load  
increases with larger ridge-to-eave spans \(W \) and smaller roof slopes.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.11 Ponding Instability. Because of roof deflection caused by snow weight,  
positive slope to roof drains may be lost, thereby causing ponding. This section requires the roof  
framing to be stiff enough to maintain positive slope to the roof drains, so as to prevent potential  
instability from progressive deflection caused by ponding.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1608-4 PV panels potentially cause snow drift loads.  
Figure 1608-5 Sliding snow load.  
ASCE 7 Section 7.12 Existing roofs. Existing roofs are required to be evaluated for the  
potential effects of increased snow loads caused by additions or alterations. Owners or agents  
acting for owners of structures with an existing lower roof should be advised of the possibility of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationincreased snow loads where a higher roof is constructed within 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) of an existing  
roof.  
Section 1609 Wind Loads  
1609.1 Applications. The following basic requirement is specified\: Wind loads must not be  
decreased considering the effect of shielding by other structures. As the ASCE 7 Commentary  
points out, the one possible exception to this rule would be the use of wind tunnel tests in  
accordance with Chapter 31 of ASCE 7.  
1609.1.1 Determination of wind loads. The IBC does not provide any methods for determining  
wind loads. Instead, this subsection states that wind loads on every building or structure are to be  
determined in accordance with ASCE 7 Chapters 26 through 30.  
Section 1609.1.1 does allow the designer to utilize either the IBC or ASCE 7 to determine the  
type of opening protection, the basic design wind speed \(V\), and the exposure category for the  
site. This subsection then provides exceptions to these design requirements. The exceptions  
address, with limitations, the use of the following design guides or methods\:  
• ICC 600 Standard for Residential Construction in High Wind Regions used for Group R-2  
and R-3 buildings based also on the limitations set out in Section 1609.1.1.1,  
• AWC WFCM Wood Frame Construction Manual for One- and Two-Family Dwellings  
used for residential structures,  
• AISI S230 Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—Prescriptive Method for One- and  
Two-Family Dwellings used for residential structures,  
• NAAMM FP 1001 Guide Specifications for Design of Metal Flagpoles,  
• TIA-222-H Structural Standard for Antenna Supporting Structures, Antennas and Small  
Wind Turbine Support Structures, and  
• Wind tunnel testing in accordance with ASCE 7  
The methods used to compute wind loads are found in one of the six ASCE 7 chapters.  
Chapter 26 covers general wind load design requirements; Chapters 27 and 28 cover the  
directional and envelope procedures for design of main wind-force-resisting systems \(MWFRS\);  
Chapter 29 addresses building appurtenances and other structures using MWFRS \(e.g., screen  
walls, signs, etc.\); and Chapter 30 covers design of components and cladding; and Chapter 31  
covers requirements for the wind tunnel procedure. Chapter 27 \(directional procedure\) applies to  
enclosed, partially enclosed, and open buildings of all heights. Chapter 28 \(envelope procedure\)  
applies to low-rise buildings. Part 2 of Chapter 28 is a projected area method that applies to  
enclosed simple diaphragm buildings.  
Simplified provisions for low-rise buildings. The simplified provisions in ASCE 7 Chapter 28,  
Part 2 and Chapter 30, Part 2 are applicable to the design of MWFRSs and components and  
claddings of buildings that satisfy all the following conditions\:  
1\. 2. Enclosed building \(see Section 26.10 of ASCE 7\).  
Flat roof, gabled roof, or hipped roof with θ ≤ 45° \(0.79 rad\).  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation3\. Mean roof height is less than or equal to 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) in accordance with  
definition of “low-rise building” in Section 26.2 of ASCE 7.  
4\. The building does not have response characteristics making it subject to across wind  
loading, vortex shedding, and instability that is due to galloping or flutter. Also, the  
building is not to be located on a site for which channeling effects or buffeting in the  
wake of upwind obstructions warrant special consideration.  
5\. The building is regular shaped \(see definition in Section 26.2 of ASCE 7\).  
In addition, the building must meet further requirements for its MWFRS to qualify for the  
simplified design procedure, including simple diaphragm buildings with no expansion joint or  
structural separation, exempted from torsional load cases, and not classified as flexible building.  
Note that in case only the components and cladding of a building qualify to be designed by the  
simplified procedure, then the MWFRSs need to be designed by the analytical procedure or  
wind-tunnel procedure.  
Some examples of simple diaphragm buildings are houses with plywood shear walls, typical  
CMU \(concrete masonry unit\) wall buildings, concrete-frame buildings, and steel-frame  
buildings with vertically spanning walls and floor and roof diaphragms. Metal buildings with  
horizontal girts that span between frames are not simple diaphragm buildings.  
Much of the simplicity of the procedure derives from the fact that internal pressures are not  
involved in the design pressures for the MWFRS. Because the wind forces are delivered to the  
MWFRS via floor and roof diaphragms, and the building, by definition, is enclosed, the internal  
pressures simply do not come into play \(or cancel out\).  
Step 1\: Mapped wind speed. The basic design wind speed is to be determined from IBC  
Figures 1609.3\(1\) through 1609.3\(12\), which are reproductions of ASCE 7 Figures 26.5-1A  
through 26.5-2D. See discussion for IBC Section 1609.3.  
Step 2\: Exposure category. See discussion for IBC Section 1609.4.  
Step 3\: Topographic factor. Topographic factor, Kzt, accounts for the increase in wind speeds  
due to an abrupt change in the upwind terrain such as the presence of an isolated hill, ridge, or  
escarpment. However, the isolated feature needs to make a significant difference in the general  
terrain features to have an effect on the design wind speed. ASCE 7 Section 26.8 provides the  
detailed requirements for determining the topographic factor. The value of Kzt can be calculated  
by using ASCE 7 Figure 26.8-1 and Equation 26.8-1. More discussion can be found in ASCE 7  
Commentary Section C26.8.  
Step 4\: Design wind pressure. Simplified design wind pressure is calculated by using ASCE 7  
Equation 28.5-1 for MWFRSs. Figure 28.5-1 provides the simplified design wind pressures on  
different pressure zones, designated as A through H, for Exposure Category B and mean roof  
height of 30 feet \(9,144 mm\). An adjustment factor, λ, is also provided in the same tables to  
adjust the tabulated wind pressure values to those for exposure categories C and D and mean roof  
height of the structure being considered up to 60 feet \(18,288 mm\).  
Minimum design wind loads are specified in Section 28.5.4. A minimum ultimate pressure of  
16 psf \(0.77 kN/m2\) is to be applied over Zones A and C along with a pressure of 8 psf \(0.38  
kN/m2\) applied at Zones B and D, while having zero pressure on Zones E through H.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1609.2 Protection of openings. In wind-borne debris regions, glazing in buildings must be made  
impact resistant or be protected with an impact-resistant covering in compliance with the  
following\: \(1\) glazed openings located within 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) of grade meet requirements of  
the large missile test of ASTM E1996, and \(2\) glazed openings located more than 30 feet \(9,144  
mm\) above grade meet the provisions of the small missile test of ASTM E1996. The mandatory  
protection requirements are meant to maintain building envelope integrity and thereby prevent  
building damage due to wind and water and the consequent financial and functional losses.  
An exception to the above requirement provides the builder and/or owner of one- to three-  
story buildings that are classified as Group R-3 or R-4 occupancy with a low-cost alternative to  
the installation of permanent shutters or laminated glass meeting the requirements of ASTM  
E1996. This exception requires the builder to provide wood structural panels precut to fit each  
glazed opening and further requires that corrosion-resistant panel attachment anchors be  
permanently installed on the building. This is to allow the building owners to attach the  
protective panels quickly and efficiently while making sure that proper anchorage requirements  
are met to adequately withstand the required components and cladding loads of hurricane winds.  
The second and third exceptions permit any openings in Risk Category I buildings and  
openings located at least 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) above ground in Risk Category II, III, or IV  
buildings to remain unprotected. Additionally, the second part of the third exception recognizes  
that loose roof aggregate that is not protected by a high parapet can act as a potential source of  
wind-borne debris. When such a source is present within 1,500 feet \(457 m\) of a Risk Category  
II, III, or IV building, an opening needs to be at least 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) above the source roof to  
be exempted from the protection requirements. More discussion can be found in ASCE 7  
Commentary Section C26.12.  
1609.3 Basic wind speed. ASCE 7 uses basic design wind speed, V, in mph, for the  
determination of wind loads. The basic design wind speed is determined by Figures 1609.3\(1\)  
through 1609.3\(12\), or the corresponding maps in Chapter 26 of ASCE 7. For Risk Category II  
buildings, the basic design wind speed is obtained from Figure 1609.3\(1\), 1609.3\(5\), or  
1609.3\(6\). For Risk Category III buildings, the basic design wind speed is obtained from Figure  
1609.3\(2\), 1609.3\(7\), or 1609.3\(8\). For Risk Category IV buildings, the basic wind speed is  
obtained from Figure 1609.3\(3\), 1609.3\(9\), or 1609.3\(10\). For Risk Category I buildings, the  
basic design wind speed is obtained from Figure 1609.3\(4\), 1609.3\(11\), or 1609.3\(12\) For the  
special wind regions indicated near mountainous terrain and near gorges, the basic design wind  
speed is to be based on local jurisdiction requirements in accordance with Section 26.5.2 of  
ASCE 7.  
In nonhurricane-prone regions, when the basic design wind speed is estimated from regional  
climatic data, V is to be determined in accordance with Section 26.5.3 of ASCE 7.  
1609.3.1 Wind speed conversion. Where required, such as for use with an older design  
standard, V must be converted to the allowable stress design wind speed, Vasd, using either Table  
1609.3.1 or Equation 16-17.  
1609.4 Exposure category. For each wind direction considered, an exposure category must be  
determined based on the building location with respect to its proximity to the surface roughness  
categories described in Section 1609.4.2.  
The IBC exposure category definitions are structured similarly to the ASCE 7 provisions. A  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSurface Roughness Category is first determined for the building site, and the Exposure Category  
of the building is then determined based on the Surface Roughness Category prevailing over  
specified distances in the upwind direction. The definitions for the three types of surface  
roughness categories \(B, C, and D\) and the three types of exposure categories \(B, C, and D\) are  
identical to those given in ASCE 7.  
Figure 1609-1 Upwind sectors for determination of governing exposure category.  
Once a surface roughness category has been established for a given wind direction, an  
exposure category is determined from the provisions of Section 1609.4.3. Exposure B applies  
where Surface Roughness B prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of at least 1,500 feet  
\(457 m\) for buildings with mean roof heights less than or equal to 30 feet \(9,144 mm\). When the  
mean roof height is greater than 30 feet \(9,144 mm\), the upwind distance is 2,600 feet \(792 m\) or  
20 times the height of the building, whichever is greater. Exposure D is applicable when Surface  
Roughness D prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of at least 5,000 feet \(1,524 m\) or 20  
times the building height, whichever is greater. This exposure is to extend into downwind areas  
of Surface Roughness B or C for a distance of 600 feet \(183 m\) or 20 times the building height,  
whichever is greater. Exposure C applies where Exposures B and D do not apply. Commentary  
Section C26.7 of ASCE 7 contains a method to determine surface roughness categories and  
exposure categories in cases where a more detailed assessment is required or desired.  
In IBC Section 1609.4.1, clear guidelines are provided for determining the governing  
exposure category whereby two upwind sectors, each enclosing an angle of 45° \(0.79 rad\) from  
the selected wind direction \(Figure 1609-1\), are to be considered separately, and the exposure  
resulting in the highest wind load governs the design for the selected wind direction. This is  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationparticularly helpful in establishing a more objective determination of exposure category for  
buildings located in a transition zone of two types of exposures. Considerable discussion of  
determination of exposure category is provided in ASCE 7 Commentary Section C26.7. Several  
example photos of various exposure categories are given at the end of Chapter 26.  
1609.5 Roof systems. The roof system consists of the roof deck and the roof covering.  
Provisions for each are discussed below.  
1609.5.1 Roof deck. The roof deck is a structural component of the building. Thus, it is required  
to be designed to resist the wind pressures determined by the provisions of ASCE 7.  
1609.5.2 Roof coverings. If the roof deck is relatively impermeable, the wind pressures will act  
through the roof deck to the building framing system. If the roof covering is also relatively  
impermeable and fastened to the roof deck, the two components will be subject to the same wind  
pressures. If the roof covering is air permeable, wind pressures are able to develop on both the  
top of the roof covering and underneath the roof covering. This venting action of the roof negates  
some of the wind pressures on the roof covering.  
1609.5.3 Rigid tile. As explained above, in certain types of installations, the roof covering is not  
subject to the same wind pressures as the roof deck. Such installations include concrete and clay  
tile roof coverings. The gaps occurring at the joints allow some equalization of pressure between  
the inner and outer faces of the tiles, leading to reduced pressures. The equation given in this  
section has been developed by research for the determination of wind loads \(uplift moments\) on  
loose-laid and mechanically fastened roof tiles when laid over sheathing with an underlayment.  
The procedure is based on practical measurements on real tiles to determine the effect of air  
being able to penetrate the roof covering.  
Section 1610 Soil Loads and Hydrostatic Pressure  
1610.1 Lateral pressures. Table 1610-1, in addition to showing soil lateral loads from the IBC  
and the ASCE 7 Standard, also shows soil lateral load values using the calculation procedure that  
formed the basis of the values included in The BOCA National Building Code. The calculated  
soil lateral loads are presented for both moist and saturated conditions. Table 1610-1 shows that  
for gravels and sands, IBC, ASCE 7, and the calculated soil lateral loads for moist conditions  
closely agree. For silts and silt–clay mixtures, the IBC values tend to agree more closely with the  
calculated soil lateral loads for moist conditions, whereas ASCE 7 values are closer to the  
calculated soil lateral loads for saturated conditions. Footnote a to IBC Table 1610.1 as well as  
ASCE 7 Table 3.2-1 states that the design lateral soil loads are given for moist soil conditions,  
which appears to be the case for the IBC soil loads.  
Table 1610-1. Soil Lateral Loads–Calculated versus Code and Standard Values  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAccording to the exception to Section 1610.1, foundation walls \(basement walls\) extending  
not more than 8 feet \(2,438 mm\) below grade and laterally supported at the top by flexible  
diaphragms are permitted to be designed for active pressure. In order to be considered  
“restrained,  
” the flexible diaphragm must brace the top of the foundation wall. There are two  
scenarios that must be verified to ensure the diaphragm is bracing the top of the wall. First, the  
diaphragm itself should be anchored directly to the top of wall. A cripple wall cannot be  
introduced between the diaphragm and the foundation wall or a hinge is created, and the wall is  
not properly braced. Second, when floor framing runs parallel to the foundation wall, appropriate  
blocking and boundary nailing must be provided to stiffen the diaphragm where it connects to  
the top of wall \(see Figure 1610-1\).  
Expansive soils are found in many regions of the United States. Without special design  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconsiderations, expansive soil can cause serious damage to basement walls. Footnote b of Table  
1610.1 prohibits the use of expansive soils as backfill because of the potential for very high  
lateral pressures acting against walls. In this case, it is preferable to excavate expansive soils and  
backfill with suitable nonexpansive material such as sands and gravels.  
1610.2 Uplift loads on floor and foundations. Just as expansive soils should be avoided as  
backfill for foundation walls, they can also cause serious damage to concrete slabs-on-grade. The  
upward movement of expansive soils is often referred to as soil heave. This new section was  
added to the 2021 IBC and requires that concrete slabs-on-grade be designed for uplift pressures  
if they are founded on expansive soils or located in areas that have a shallow water table.  
Section 1611 Rain Loads  
Like many other sections in Chapter 16, Section 1611 is to be used in conjunction with ASCE 7.  
Chapter 8 of ASCE 7 is used to design primary and secondary drainage systems of a flat roof.  
IBC Section 1611 contains Figure 1611.1, to be used as an alternative to ASCE 7’s use of 15-  
minute rainfall rates for secondary drainage systems. Figure 1611.1 provides the 100-year hourly  
rainfall rates used in the absence of other approved local weather data for the purpose of  
determining the design rain loads for secondary drains.  
1611.1 Design rain loads. Each portion of a roof is required to be designed to sustain the load of  
rainwater that will accumulate on it if the primary drainage systems for that portion are blocked,  
plus the uniform load caused by water that rises above the inlet of the secondary drainage system  
at its design flow. The design load is computed using IBC Equation 16-19 \(ASCE 7 Equation  
8.3-1\).  
1611.2 Ponding instability. Ponding instability refers to the potential for structural failure or  
collapse due to progressive deflection from ponding water or full snow loads. A susceptible bay  
is defined as a roof, or portion thereof with either of the following\: \(1\) inadequate slope as  
defined in ASCE 7 or \(2\) where water accumulates if the primary drainage system is blocked but  
the secondary drain system is operational. Only those portions of the roof considered susceptible  
bays must be designed for ponding.  
1611.3 Controlled drainage. When a roof has hardware to slow the rate of water flow in the  
primary drain, the secondary system should be placed at an elevation that limits additional water  
accumulation.

Section 1612 Flood Loads  
1612.1 General. Section 1612.1 simply states that buildings and structures in flood hazard areas  
as established in Section 1612.3 must be designed and constructed to resist the effects of flood  
hazards and flood loads, as prescribed in this section. This section also establishes the  
requirement of complying with the “substantial improvement” and “substantial damage”  
requirements. Specifically, a structure located within a special “flood hazard area” that is not  
currently compliant with the finished floor elevation requirements of the National Flood  
Insurance Program \(NFIP\) must be elevated so as to bring it into compliance with the NFIP as  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfound within ASCE 24.  
The flood provisions referenced by the IBC are found within ASCE 24, Flood Resistant  
Design and Construction. Much of the impetus for flood-resistant design has come from  
initiatives of flood insurance and flood-damage mitigation sponsored by the federal government.  
The NFIP is based on an agreement between the federal government and participating  
communities that have been identified as being flood prone. The Federal Emergency  
Management Agency \(FEMA\), through the Federal Insurance Administration, makes flood  
insurance available to the residents of communities, provided that the community adopts and  
enforces adequate flood-plain management regulations that meet the minimum requirements.  
Included in the NFIP requirements, found under Title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal  
Regulations, are minimum design and construction standards for buildings located in special  
flood hazard areas.  
Special flood hazard areas are those identified by FEMA’s Mitigation Directorate as being  
subject to inundation during the 100-year flood \(flood having a 1-percent chance of being  
equaled or exceeded in any given year\), special flood hazard areas are shown on flood insurance  
rate maps that are produced for flood-prone communities. Special flood hazard areas are  
identified on such maps as A Zones and Coastal A Zones \(A, AE, A1-30, A99, AR, AO, or AH\)  
or V Zones \(V, VE, VO, or V1-30\). In the special flood hazard areas, communities are  
encouraged to adopt and enforce NFIP-compliant, flood-damage-resistant design and  
construction practices.  
The provisions of ASCE 24 meet or exceed the building science provisions of the NFIP and  
present the consensus state-of-the-art approach to flood-resistant construction. ASCE 24 requires  
that the design of structures within flood hazard areas be governed by the loading provisions of  
ASCE 7. That standard requires that the structural systems of buildings be designed, constructed,  
connected, and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and permanent lateral movement due to the  
action of wind loads and loads from flooding associated with the design flood. Wind loads and  
flood loads may act simultaneously at coastlines, particularly during hurricanes and coastal  
storms. This may also be true in some other situations cited in the ASCE 7 Commentary Section  
C5.3.1. Flood loads are the loads or pressures on the surfaces of buildings and structures caused  
by the presence of floodwaters. These loads are of two basic types—hydrostatic and  
hydrodynamic. Wave loads are considered a special type of hydrodynamic load. Additionally,  
impact loads result from objects transported by floodwaters striking against structures. Minimum  
design hydrostatic, loads, hydrodynamic loads, wave loads, and impact loads are specified in  
ASCE 7. Wave loads may be determined by using an analytical procedure outlined by more  
advanced numerical modeling procedures, or by laboratory test procedures or physical modeling.  
ASCE 24 requires that the design and construction of structures located in flood hazard areas  
consider all flood-related hazards, including hydrostatic loads, hydrodynamic loads and wave  
action, debris impacts, alluvial fan flooding, flood-related erosion, ice flows or ice jams, and  
mudslides in accordance with the requirements of that standard if specified or, if not specified in  
that standard, then in accordance with the requirements approved by the authority having  
jurisdiction. Important to the enforcement of these provisions, design documents are required to  
identify, and take into account, flood-related and other concurrent loads that will act on the  
structure. Design documents must also consider, but not be limited to, the applicable conditions  
listed below\:  
1\. Wave action  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. High-velocity floodwaters  
3\. Impacts due to debris in the floodwaters  
4\. Rapid inundation by floodwaters  
5\. Rapid drawdown of floodwaters  
6\. Prolonged inundation by floodwaters  
7\. Wave- and flood-induced erosion and scour  
8\. Deposition and sedimentation by floodwaters.  
1612.2 Design and Construction. This section requires the design and construction of buildings  
and structures located in flood hazard areas, including coastal high-hazard areas and coastal A  
zones, to be in accordance with Chapter 5 of ASCE 7 and ASCE 24.  
1612.3 Establishment of flood hazard areas. Flood hazard areas are established by the local  
jurisdiction through adoption of a flood-hazard map and supporting data. Minimum requirements  
imposed on the jurisdiction are spelled out. Two key pieces of information that are not part of the  
minimum requirement are the design flood elevations and designation of floodways \(floodways  
are areas along riverine bodies that convey the bulk of floodwaters\). A large percentage of areas  
that are mapped as special flood hazard areas by the NFIP do not have flood elevations and do  
not have floodway designations. In such an absence, the building official can require that the  
design flood elevations be either obtained from any pertinent data available from the federal,  
state, or other sources, or determined by a registered design professional in accordance with  
accepted hydrologic and hydraulic engineering practices.  
Development in riverine floodplains can increase flood levels and loads on other properties,  
especially if it occurs in areas known as floodways that must be reserved to convey flood flows.  
The floodway, by definition, is a river, creek, or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas  
that “must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the  
water surface elevation more than a designated height.  
” For the purpose of this section, the  
designated height is 1 foot \(305 mm\).  
1612.4 Flood-hazard documentation. This lists a number of documents that must be furnished  
to the building official. The requirements are different for construction in coastal high-hazard  
areas and coastal A zones compared to other flood hazard areas. The 2021 IBC adds the  
requirement to provide a flood emergency plan for nonresidential buildings and revises  
provisions for breakaway walls in coastal high hazard areas and coastal A zones.  
Section 1613 Earthquake Loads  
Overview. In the IBC, the seismic load provisions are largely adopted through reference to  
ASCE 7. The earthquake provisions of ASCE 7 are mainly derived from the NEHRP Provisions.  
For information regarding the application of the IBC seismic provisions, one should refer to the  
NEHRP Provisions Part 2—Commentary. In addition, the ASCE 7 Commentary provides some  
background on the seismic requirements. One other valuable reference is the 2018 IBC SEAOC  
Structural Seismic Design Manual, Volume 1, Code Application Examples, which is a  
compilation of sample calculations developed by the Structural Engineers Association of  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationCalifornia.  
Using these provisions, restrictions on building height and structural irregularity, choice of  
analysis procedures that form the basis of seismic design, as well as the level of detailing  
required for a particular structure are all governed by a structure’s Seismic Design Category  
\(SDC\), a classification that considers the nature of the occupancy along with the soil-modified  
ground motion at the site of the structure. In other words, when designing for earthquakes under  
the IBC, the required detailing as well as other seismic system limitations are affected by the soil  
characteristics at the site.  
Also see Section 1604.10 discussion on building behavior due to earthquake ground motions.  
1613.1 Scope. Section 1613 incorporates the seismic load provisions of ASCE 7, except for the  
items covered in Chapters 14 and 16. After having stated that every structure and portions  
thereof shall, at a minimum, be designed and constructed to resist the effects of earthquake  
motions and assigned an SDC in accordance with Section 1613 or ASCE 7, the IBC permits a  
number of important exceptions\:  
1\. Detached one- and two-family dwellings in SDC A, B, or C or located where SS is less  
than 0.4g are exempt from seismic design requirements. The last part of this exception  
removes the need to determine the SDC, which in turn requires the determination of site  
class, in low-to-moderate hazard areas.  
2\. The seismic-force-resisting systems of wood-frame buildings that strictly conform to the  
provisions of Section 2308 \(Conventional Light-Frame Construction\) need not be  
analyzed as required by Section 1613.1. However, conventional wood-frame buildings  
must meet all of the limitations imposed by Section 2308.2.  
3\. Agricultural storage structures intended only for incidental human occupancy are exempt  
from all seismic design requirements. This is because of the very low risk to life that is  
involved.  
4\. Certain special structures such as “vehicular bridges, electrical transmission towers,  
hydraulic structures, buried utility lines and their appurtenances, and nuclear reactors” are  
placed outside the scope of Section 1613. These structures require special consideration of  
their response characteristics and environment, and need to be designed in accordance  
with other regulations.  
1613.2 Seismic ground motion values. The procedure for determining the maximum considered  
earthquake design spectral response accelerations \(SDS and SD1\), site class, and SDC are given  
in this section.  
1613.2.1 Mapped acceleration parameters. The mapped maximum considered earthquake  
\(MCE\) spectral response accelerations at short periods \(SS\) and at 1-second period \(S1\) for a  
particular site are to be determined from Figures 1613.2.1\(1\) through 1613.2.1\(10\). Where a site  
is between contours, straight-line interpolation or the value of the higher contour may be used.  
The IBC maps for SS and S1 are based on USGS maps produced by the United States  
Geological Survey \(USGS\). In areas of moderate- to high-seismicity, obtaining ground motions  
from the IBC Figures based on the human eye is often not sufficient. In seismic regions it is  
recommended that the spectral accelerations for a site be determined by accessing one of several  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationonline applications which have access to these same USGS maps. The ATC “Hazards by  
Location” tool described in Section 1608.2 is one of these applications. The free web-based tool  
allows a designer to determine the appropriate design snow, wind, and seismic information for a  
particular site.  
1613.2.2 Site class definitions. The soil site class is a very important parameter when  
determining the ground motions at a particular site. For projects requiring a geotechnical report,  
the soil site class can be found in the report while those not having, or requiring, a report should  
be determined using Table 20.3-1 of ASCE 7 \(see Table 1613-1\). The ground motions provided  
in Figures 1613.2.1\(1\) through 1613.2.1\(10\) assume a soil site class B, which is classified as  
rock in Table 1613-1. The mapped ground motions must then be adjusted based on the site’s soil  
type in order to determine the design ground motions to be used. If there is not sufficient  
information to classify the site soils then Site Class D should be assumed unless the building  
official feels that Site Class E or F soils may be present at the site. Site Class E-F soils consist of  
soft clays, peats, and liquefiable soils.  
Table 1613-1. Soil Site Classification  
1613.2.3 Site coefficients and adjusted maximum considered earthquake spectral response  
acceleration parameters. SMS is obtained by multiplying the mapped MCE spectral response  
acceleration SS \(at short periods\) by Fa, the acceleration-related site coefficient \[see Table  
1613.2.3\(1\)\]. SM1 is similarly obtained by multiplying the mapped MCE spectral response  
acceleration S1 \(at 1-second period\) by Fv, the velocity-related site coefficient \[see Table  
1613.2.3\(2\)\].  
Site coefficients are determined by the closest distance from a site to known seismic sources  
that are capable of generating large-magnitude earthquakes and the types of those seismic  
sources. Section 20.3.1 of ASCE 7 notes that areas having Site Class F soils shall undergo a site-  
specific response analysis rather than using the mapped ground motions provided in the IBC.  
This is further clarified in Tables 1613.2.3\(1\) and 1613.2.3\(2\) as they refer the user to Section  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation11.4.8 of ASCE 7 which notes this same requirement.  
When a geotechnical investigation is not performed, a designer often assumes that a Site Class  
D soil exists. In addition, if the geotechnical engineer does not investigate to a depth of 100 feet  
\(30.48 m\), they often assume a Site Class D soil as well. If Site Class D soils are assumed, as  
allowed by Section 1613.2.2, the short-period site coefficient \(Fa\) must be taken as no less than  
1.2\. In areas of high seismicity, this could be an increase in design ground motions of 20%. The  
ATC “Hazards by Location” tool mentioned previously allows a designer to input calculated Site  
Class D or “assumed” Site Class D. If “assumed” is selected, the correct Fa value will be selected  
by the application. This could greatly affect the design so both the designer and the building  
official should pay special attention to ensure that a correct Fa value is used if the site class is  
assumed.  
IBC Tables 1613.2.3\(1\) and 1613.2.3\(2\) include some additional provisions within their  
footnotes of which a building official should be aware. If a soil Site Class D or E occurs and the  
mapped one-second spectral acceleration exceeds 0.2g, Table 1613.2.3\(2\) requires that a ground  
motion hazard analysis \(GMHA\) be provided as outlined in Section 11.4.8 of ASCE 7. Similarly,  
Table 1613.2.3\(1\) requires a GMHA to be provided when soil Site Class E occurs, and the  
mapped short-period spectral acceleration exceeds 1.0g. The GMHA is an additional analysis  
that must be performed by the geotechnical engineer and obviously requires additional cost to a  
project. In lieu of providing a GMHA, the designer must show the building official how the  
project meets one of the exceptions outlined in Section 11.4.8 of ASCE 7.  
1613.2.4 Design spectral response acceleration parameters. Five-percent damped design  
spectral response accelerations at short periods, SDS, and at 1-second period, SD1, are equal to  
two-thirds SMS \(= FaSs\) and two-thirds SM1 \(= FvS1\), respectively. In other words, the design  
ground motion is two-thirds of the soil-modified maximum considered earthquake ground  
motion. This is in recognition of the inherent margin contained in the NEHRP Provisions that  
would make collapse unlikely under one and one-half times the design level ground motion.  
Figure 1613-2 summarizes the derivation of the design quantities SDS and SD1.  
Figure 1613-2. Design Ground Motion of the IBC.  
1613.2.5 Determination of seismic design category. This section creates six design categories  
that are key to establishing the design requirements for any building based on its occupancy and  
on the level of expected soil-modified seismic ground motion. The IBC uses SDCs to determine  
permissible structural systems, limitations on height and irregularity, the type of lateral force  
analysis that must be performed, the level of detailing for structural members, and joints that are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationpart of the lateral-force-resisting system and for the components that are not. The SDC is a  
function of occupancy and of soil-modified seismic risk at the site of the structure in the form of  
the design spectral response acceleration at short periods, SDS, and the design spectral response  
acceleration at 1-second period, SD1.  
A structure located where S1 ≥ 0.75g is assigned to SDC E if it is in Risk Category I, II, or III  
and to SDC F if it is in Risk Category IV. For structures not assigned to SDC E or F, the SDC  
needs to be determined twice—first as a function of SDS by Table 1613.2.5\(1\) and a second time  
as a function of SD1 by Table 1613.2.5\(2\); the more severe category governs.  
SDC A applies to structures, irrespective of their occupancy, in regions where anticipated  
ground motions are minor, even for very long return periods.  
SDC B includes Risk Category I, II, or III structures in regions where moderately destructive  
ground shaking is anticipated.  
SDC C includes Risk Category IV structures where moderately destructive ground shaking  
may occur as well as Risk Category I through III structures in regions with somewhat more  
severe ground-shaking potential.  
SDC D includes structures of Risk Category IV structures located in regions of severe  
seismicity and above, and Risk Category I through III structures located in regions expected to  
experience destructive ground shaking.  
As noted previously, structures located close to major active faults where the mapped value of  
S1 is greater than or equal to 0.75 are directly assigned to SDC E or F. SDC E includes Risk  
Category I, II, or III structures in regions located close to major active faults, and SDC F  
includes Risk Category IV structures in those locations \(see Figure 1613-3\).  
Figure 1613-3 Areas of the contiguous United States where S1 ≥ 0.75g.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1613.2.5.1 Alternative seismic design category determination. In view of the fact that it is  
unnecessary and wasteful to require that the SDC of a short-period structure be based on long-  
period ground motion, the IBC permits the SDC determination to be based on SDS alone \[Table  
1613.2.5\(1\)\], provided\:  
1\. 1-second mapped spectral response acceleration, S1, is less than 0.75g;  
2 .Ta \< 0.8TS where Ta is the approximate fundamental period of the structure and TS =  
SD1/SDS ;  
3\. Fundamental period of the structure used to calculate story drift is \< TS ;  
4\. Upper-bound design base shear is used in design \[e.g., V = SDSW/\(R/Ie\)\]; and  
5\. The diaphragms are rigid or permitted to be idealized as rigid, or for diaphragms  
permitted to be idealized as flexible, the distance between vertical elements of the  
seismic-force-resisting system does not exceed 40 feet \(12,192 mm\).  
The first criterion means that SDC determination cannot be based on SDS alone for structures  
in the vicinity of known faults that can generate large earthquakes \(so-called near-fault  
structures\).  
The period TS = SD1/SDS is the period at which the short-period or constant-acceleration part  
of the design spectrum transitions into the long-period or velocity-governed part of the spectrum.  
It is the dividing line between short-period and long-period response. By requiring in Item 2 that  
the approximate fundamental period, Ta, be less than 0.8TS rather than TS itself, the intent of the  
code is to minimize the possibility that the actual fundamental period, T, might equal or exceed  
TS, even though Ta is less than TS. However, this requirement appears to become superfluous in  
the presence of the requirement in Item 3. ASCE 7 does not impose an upper limit on the period  
used to calculate story drift, and as a result, it probably is a more realistic representation of the  
actual period of the structure than Ta.  
Item 4 requires that the upper-bound design base shear, as given by the constant-acceleration  
or flat-top part of the design spectrum, be used in the design of a structure utilizing this  
exception. This requirement is intended to impose a design force penalty on a structure for which  
T may equal or exceed TS, while Ta is less than 0.8TS.  
The last criterion makes the relaxation in question inapplicable to structures with flexible  
diaphragms, because a flexible diaphragm may dramatically influence the elastic fundamental  
period of such a structure to the extent that it may exceed the approximate fundamental period,  
Ta. However, when the span of a flexible diaphragm is no more than 40 feet \(12,192 mm\), the  
dynamics of the diaphragms are unlikely to drastically influence the period of the structure, and  
as a result, the provision in Section 1613.2.5.1 can still be used.  
Whether there is any advantage to be gained from the relaxation permitted in this section  
depends strictly on the relationship between SDS and SD1 at the site of a structure. For many  
locations across the United States, there is no advantage to be gained, because the soil-modified  
short- and long-period ground motion parameters yield the same SDC. However, in certain  
situations, the relaxation in question may yield a one- or even two-category reduction in the  
SDC. In other words, while the SDC may be based on SD1, it may be only on the basis of SDS. In  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthat case, only intermediate, rather than special, detailing would be required for the seismic-  
force-resisting system.  
1613.2.5.2 Simplified design procedure. The alternate simplified design procedure of ASCE 7  
Section 12.14 applies to simple bearing wall or building frame systems. The structure being three  
stories or less and classified as Risk Category I or II are just two of the twelve conditions. If the  
building and site meet all conditions of ASCE 7 Section 12.14, the SDC shall be determined in  
accordance with ASCE 7.  
1613.3 Ballasted photovoltaic panel systems. With the increasing use of PV solar panels on  
rooftops, specific seismic code requirements related to these panels is necessary. This section  
includes specific seismic requirements for ballasted, roof-mounted PV solar panels. The systems  
must be designed to resist sliding and uplift resulting from lateral and vertical forces as required  
by applicable load combinations using a coefficient of friction determined by acceptable  
engineering principles of mechanics. When installed on structures in SDC C, D, E, or F,  
ballasted nonpenetrating systems must be designed to accommodate seismic displacement  
determined by nonlinear response-history analysis or shake-table testing, using input motions  
consistent with the nonstructural component requirements of ASCE 7.  
Section 1614 Atmospheric Ice Loads  
This section provides charging text in the IBC, which references the technical provisions of  
ASCE 7 for atmospheric ice loads. This section relies on the determination of which structures  
are ice sensitive in order to decide the need to comply with the applicable provisions of ASCE 7.  
An “ice-sensitive structure” is defined in Section 202 and provides the technical basis for  
determining which structures are ice sensitive.  
Section 1615 Tsunami Loads  
1615.1 General. Many coastal areas in the western United States including Alaska, Washington,  
Oregon, California, and Hawaii are subject to potentially destructive tsunamis. These  
communities, which need tsunami-resistant design of critical infrastructure and essential  
facilities, require a standard for designated tsunami vertical evacuation refuge structures as an  
alternative to nonexistent high ground. This section requires that critical infrastructure and  
essential facilities designated as Risk Category III or IV be designed in accordance with Chapter  
6 of ASCE 7.  
Section 1616 Structural Integrity  
This section applies specifically to high-rise buildings that are classified as Risk Category III or  
IV. The code defines a high-rise building as one that has an occupied floor located more than 75  
feet \(22,860 mm\) above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access. Detailing  
requirements are provided for concrete- and steel-frame structures, whereas minimum  
requirements for vertical, longitudinal, transverse, and perimeter ties are provided for bearing-  
wall structures.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe purpose of this section is to provide a minimum level of structural integrity by  
establishing requirements for tying together primary structural elements. These provisions have  
been developed by a broad coalition of industry members involved in steel, concrete, masonry,  
and wood structures, and apply as appropriate to structures of all materials. Although the  
structural integrity requirements already included in ACI 318, coupled with common design and  
construction practices adopted in the United States, are generally adequate to provide a  
satisfactory level of structural integrity to most concrete structures, this section expands on those  
provisions in order to include other building materials as well.  
KEY POINTS  
• This chapter prescribes minimum structural loading requirements for the design of  
buildings and other structures regulated by the IBC.  
• In addition to the general requirements for construction documents given in Section  
107, Section 1603 contains specific requirements for construction documents pertaining  
to structural loads.  
• The American Society of Civil Engineer’s Minimum Design Loads and Associated  
Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures \(ASCE/SEI 7-16\) is the referenced  
standard for structural loads.  
• General construction requirements are provided in Section 1604 for strength,  
serviceability, risk category, load tests, anchorage, and wind or seismic detailing.  
• How various structural loads are required to be combined is prescribed in Section 1605.  
• Buildings and other structures must resist all prescribed loads and be stable against  
overturning and sliding.  
• In addition to dead and live loads, buildings and other structures must resist the effects  
of environmental loads such as snow, wind, earthquake, soil, rain, flood, tsunami, and  
ice loads as required by this chapter and ASCE 7.  
• High-rise buildings assigned to Risk Category III or IV must also meet minimum  
structural integrity requirements of Section 1616 based on whether they are frame  
structures \(gravity loads supported by columns\) or bearing-wall structures \(gravity  
loads supported by walls\) as defined in Section 202.

Key Points  
The primary goal of Chapter 17 of the International Building Code® \(IBC®\) is to improve the  
quality and workmanship of certain structural systems by requiring structural testing, special  
inspection, and structural observation. Many of the requirements are specifically intended to  
improve the quality of the lateral-force-resisting system when buildings are subjected to the  
design wind or seismic event. Special inspections are also specified for many nonstructural  
components within the building to ensure the life safety of the occupants. To accomplish these  
goals, the chapter sets forth provisions for quality of materials, workmanship, testing, and  
labeling of materials incorporated into the construction of buildings or structures regulated by  
the code. Generally, all components and materials used in new buildings must conform to the  
requirements in the code, or the applicable standards referenced by the code. Specific tests and  
standards are referenced in other parts of the code. Chapter 35 contains a complete  
alphabetical list of all the testing and material standards referenced in the IBC.  
This chapter provides the requirements for special inspection and verification of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconstruction at various stages, special inspection for wind and seismic resistance, special  
testing and qualification for seismic resistance, structural observation by the registered design  
professional, and alternative methods to establish test procedures for products that do not have  
applicable standards.  
All of the administrative requirements related to special inspection, the statement of special  
inspections, contractor responsibility, and structural observations, are contained in Section  
1704\. All of the verifications required for various systems, elements, and materials, including  
special inspection requirements for wind and seismic, are now contained in Section 1705.  
Section 1701 General  
This section sets forth the scope for Chapter 17 and the general requirements for both new and  
used construction materials. Because Chapter 17 deals with construction documents and  
submittals, some discussion of the subject is warranted. The term construction documents is  
defined in Section 202 as “written, graphic and pictorial documents prepared or assembled for  
describing the design, location and physical characteristics of the elements of a project necessary  
for obtaining a building permit.  
” Construction documents are a part of the submittal documents  
required by Section 107. It should be noted that there are also specific requirements for  
construction documents in Section 1603 for structural loads, as well as in the structural material  
chapters, such as Section 1901.5 for concrete structures. There are also requirements for specific  
types of submittals, which are considered as a part of the construction documents. For example,  
Section 1803.6 for geotechnical reports, Section 2207.4 for steel joist drawings, Section  
2211.1.3.1 for cold-formed steel truss drawings, and Section 2303.4.1.1 for wood truss drawings.  
APPROVED AGENCY. The definition of this term is needed in order to affect the  
requirements of Section 1703.1. The word approved means “acceptable to the building official”  
or authority having jurisdiction \(see the definition of approved in IBC Section 202\). The basis  
for approval of an agency for a particular activity by the building official includes the  
competence or technical capability to perform the work in accordance with Section 1703.  
APPROVED FABRICATOR. An approved fabricator is a qualified person, firm, or  
corporation that is approved by the building official to perform specified work without special  
inspection because they have approved quality-control procedures and are subject to periodic  
auditing of fabrication practices by an approved special inspection agency. Approved fabricators  
issue certificates of compliance for their work product. See discussion of Section 1704.2.5.  
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE. An approved fabricator is required to submit a  
Certificate of Compliance for work performed without special inspection. See Section 1704.2.5  
for more detailed discussion of fabricator approval. Figure 1703-3 shows an example of an AITC  
certificate of compliance for a glued-laminated timber.  
DESIGNATED SEISMIC SYSTEM. The designated seismic system consists of those  
architectural, electrical, and mechanical systems and their components that require design in  
accordance with Chapter 13 of ASCE 7 for which the component importance factor, Ip, is greater  
than 1.0, as prescribed in Section 13.1.3 of ASCE 7. Section 13.1.3 of ASCE 7 lists four  
components that have an importance factor of 1.5, which include components required to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfunction after an earthquake including fire sprinkler systems and egress stairways that are not an  
integral part of the building structure; components containing hazardous, toxic, or explosive  
materials; and components in Risk Category IV structures that are necessary for continued  
operation of the facility. All other components are assigned a component importance factor of  
1.0\. Risk Category IV structures are described in detail in IBC Table 1604.5. Note that Section  
13.1.4 of ASCE 7 lists those nonstructural components that are exempt from the seismic design  
requirements of Chapter 13 and are therefore not considered to be part of the designated seismic  
system.  
FABRICATED ITEM. Fabricated items are materials assembled prior to installation in a  
building and are referred to in Section 1704.2.5. The definition is provided to clarify the intent of  
the code, as the term fabricated items could easily be interpreted to mean items for which special  
inspection is not intended by the code. An example of a fabricated item for which special  
inspection is required is roof trusses not manufactured in accordance with the in-plant quality  
control requirements of the TPI 1 standard. The section also describes elements that are not  
considered fabricated items, such as rolled structural steel, reinforcing bars, masonry units, and  
wood structural panels that are fabricated under specific quality control standards. Because  
special inspections are analogous to the quality control \(QC\) programs required by some  
standards referenced in the code, items produced in accordance with standards listed in Chapter  
35 that have quality control by a third-party quality-control agency are not considered “fabricated  
items.  
” This provision makes it clear that the code does not intend to impose a redundant special  
inspection requirement for such items.  
MAIN WIND-FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEM. The main wind-force-resisting system  
\(MWFRS\) is one of the structural systems that must be designed to resist wind loads. The other  
system that is designed to resist wind loads is components and cladding. The MWFRS comprises  
those structural elements that provide lateral support and stability for the overall structure. In  
general, these are out-of-plane walls, diaphragms, chords, collectors, vertical lateral-force-  
resisting elements such as shear walls, braced frames, and foundations. In general, the MWFRS  
receives wind loading from more than one surface. In contrast, components and cladding are  
generally on the exterior envelope of the building and receive loading directly from the wind,  
such as roof and wall covering.  
SEISMIC FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEM. The seismic force-resisting system \(SFRS\) is that  
part of the structural system that has been considered in the design to provide the required  
resistance to the prescribed seismic forces. This definition provides for the correct application of  
special inspections of seismic force-resisting systems. Unless classified as Seismic Design  
Category \(SDC\) A, the type of SFRS must be selected to conform to Section 12.2 of ASCE 7.  
Providing a level of detailing that is appropriate for the selected system is critical to complying  
with the code’s earthquake provisions.  
SPECIAL INSPECTION. That category of field inspection for which special knowledge,  
special attention, or both are required. For example, inspection of complete penetration welds  
requires both special knowledge and special attention to ensure that the requirements of the  
codes and standards are met. Note that the special inspector does not have the same authority as  
that of the jurisdiction inspector. The role of the special inspector is to report discrepancies  
between the construction in the field and the approved construction documents to the contractor.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIf uncorrected, discrepancies should be reported to the design professional in responsible charge  
and to the building official.  
SPECIAL INSPECTION, CONTINUOUS. Continuous full-time inspection is required where  
compliance of the work or product cannot be determined after incorporation into the building or  
structure. For example, one cannot determine whether a multipass fillet weld is in compliance  
with the code requirements unless each pass of the weld is inspected during the welding process.  
Whether a particular special inspection is continuous or periodic is specified in the various  
inspection and verification tables in Section 1705.  
SPECIAL INSPECTION, PERIODIC. Intermittent or part-time inspection, which may be  
allowed when the compliance of the work or product can be determined after being incorporated  
into the structure. For example, compliance with the design nailing requirements of a wood shear  
wall can be determined after construction of the wall \(but before closure\); hence, verification by  
periodic special inspection is adequate in this case. Another good example is placement of  
reinforcing bars. The special inspector need not be continuously present during placement.  
Whether a particular special inspection is periodic or continuous is specified in the various  
inspection and verification tables in Section 1705.  
STRUCTURAL OBSERVATION. Structural observation is intended to ensure general  
conformance with the design intent, and not necessarily specific conformance with the code. For  
example, in a building under construction in a high seismic area, the registered design  
professional acting as the structural observer may focus on crucial elements of the seismic-force-  
resisting system. Like the special inspector, the structural observer does not have the same  
authority as that of the jurisdiction inspector. The role of the structural observer is to report  
discrepancies between the construction in the field and the approved design documents to the  
contractor. If unresolved, discrepancies should be reported to the building official. Note that  
structural observation by the registered design professional does not replace or substitute for any  
of the requisite special inspections required by Section 1705 or the jurisdiction inspections  
required by Section 110.  
Section 1702 New Materials  
Testing is required for all materials that are not specifically provided for in the code or  
referenced standard. For example, a composite wood material that is not listed in Chapter 23  
would be required to follow the procedures set forth in this chapter. A similar provision for  
acceptance of alternative materials, systems, or methods for which the standards are not adopted  
in the code is set forth in Section 104.11. This section restates that alternative or new materials  
and methods may be used if it can be established by tests or other means that the performance of  
the new material or method will equal that required by the code for the replaced product. As  
noted, International Code Council \(ICC\) Evaluation Service Reports are often used by building  
officials as the basis for approving items that are not specifically addressed by the code or  
referenced standards.  
Used materials. Materials may be reused, provided they meet all the code requirements for new  
materials. Note, however, that Section 104.9.1 specifically restricts the use of used equipment  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand devices unless approved by the building official. One should always exercise caution in  
approving reuse of materials. The applicable material or design standards should be consulted to  
determine if reuse of materials is allowed or prohibited. For example, reuse of high-strength  
A490 structural bolts is prohibited by the Research Council on Structural Connections  
Specification for Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts \(2014\). Even a piece of used  
structural steel should be carefully checked for conformance to the design specifications,  
applicable standards, and code requirements.  
Section 1703 Approvals  
1703.1 Approved agency. The word approved means “acceptable to the building official” or the  
authority having jurisdiction \(see the definition of “Approved” in IBC Section 202\). The basis  
for approval of an agency for a particular activity by the code or building official may include the  
capacity or technical capability and expertise necessary to perform the work in accordance with  
Section 1703. Special inspection agencies, testing laboratories, and the inspection agencies that  
provide quality assurance of concrete and steel fabricators should be accredited by a recognized  
Accreditation Body. For example, testing laboratories should be accredited to ISO/IEC 17025  
General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories.  
Accreditation through the International Accreditation Service \(IAS\), a subsidiary of the ICC,  
is the most straightforward method for the building official to assure that an agency provides  
quality services and meets all of the requirements of the building code. Quality standards for  
agency approvals through IAS are defined by the following standards\:  
• Special inspection agencies should be accredited to IAS AC291.  
• Fabricators of reinforced and precast/prestressed concrete should be inspected by an  
approved special inspection agency, or by an inspection agency, which is accredited to  
IAS AC157.  
• Fabricators of structural steel should be inspected by an approved special inspection  
agency, or by an inspection agency, which is accredited to IAS AC172.  
• Fabricators of metal building systems should be inspected by an agency, which is  
accredited to IAS AC472.  
• Fabricators of cold-formed steel structural and nonstructural components not requiring  
welding should be inspected by an agency, which is accredited to IAS AC473.  
Other accreditation programs are also available that may be approved by the building official,  
such as the AISC Certification Program for Structural Steel Fabricators, the Plant Certification  
Program for steel joists by the Steel Joist Institute, or the Plant Certification Program for precast  
concrete products by the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute.  
Accreditation helps to ensure that the agency has the necessary equipment and employs  
qualified persons. For example, if an agency wishes to be approved for the special inspection of  
structural welds, the agency should submit evidence that its welding inspector is certified in  
accordance with applicable ICC, American Welding Society \(AWS\), or American Society of  
Nondestructive Testing \(ASNT\) requirements.  
1703.1.1 Independence. The agency should have objectivity as well as competence. Objectivity  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcan be measured by the agency’s financial and fiduciary independence. The agency should be  
independent of the contractor responsible for the work and have no financial ties to the  
organization it inspects. For example, a testing laboratory checking concrete strength should  
have no financial ties to the contractor, its subcontractors, or the concrete supplier.  
1703.1.2 Equipment. If any agency is not accredited as described above, the building official  
should evaluate the agency to confirm the compliance with the requirements of applicable  
standards and that it has the appropriate equipment to perform required tests or inspections.  
1703.1.3 Personnel. If the agency is not accredited, the building official should evaluate both the  
experience and qualifications of personnel. An agency may have personnel with the appropriate  
certifications but not the necessary experience. Supervisory and inspection personnel should  
have the appropriate certifications as well as the requisite experience and/or education.  
If the services being provided by an inspection or testing agency come under the purview of  
the professional registration laws of the state or jurisdiction, the building official should request  
evidence that personnel are qualified to perform the work in accordance with the requisite  
professional registration.  
1703.2 Written approval. A written approval by the building official is required for all material,  
appliances, equipment, or systems incorporated into the work in order to have a documented  
record of approval and the basis for approval.  
1703.3 Record of approval. Records must be kept for all approvals, including conditions and  
limitations of approval. The approvals must be kept on file and available for public inspection.  
The records must demonstrate compliance with the applicable code requirements of any material,  
appliance, equipment, or system incorporated into the structure.  
1703.4 Performance. When conformance with the code is predicated on the performance and  
quality of materials or products, the building official must require the submission of test reports  
from an approved agency establishing this conformance. In the absence of such reports, the  
building official should require specific data that show compliance with the intent of the  
applicable code requirements in accordance with Chapter 16 \(see IBC Sections 1604.6 and  
1604.7\). For example, core tests of in situ concrete could be used to determine compliance with  
design strength if the sample cylinders required by ACI 318 were destroyed.  
Materials and products must be subjected to various levels of quality control and  
identification in order to determine that the material complies with the requirements of the code.  
The degree of quality control and identification to which a material must be subjected is based on  
its relative importance to the structure’s performance and function. See Section 202 for  
definitions of the terms mark, certificate of compliance, manufacturer’s designation, and label.  
By use of these terms, the code establishes quality control and identification as follows\:  
Level 1\: Manufacturer identifies the material or product with the name of the material or  
product, the manufacturer’s name, and the intended usage \(see Mark\).  
Alternatively, the manufacturer provides a certificate stating that materials and  
products meet specified standards or that work was done in compliance with  
approved construction documents \(see Certificate of compliance\).  
Level 2\: Manufacturer identifies the material or product as in Level 1 and also self- certifies  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcompliance with a given standard or set of rules \(see Manufacturer’s designation\).  
Level 3\: Manufacturer identifies the material or product as in Level 1. An approved quality  
control agency performs periodic audits of the manufacturer’s facilities and  
QA/QC procedures \(see Label\).  
The term mark is an identification applied on a product by the manufacturer indicating the  
name of the manufacturer and the function of a product or material. A certificate of compliance  
might be used instead of a mark if appearance is important for the product in its intended use  
\(Figures 1703-1 and 1704-1\).  
Figure 1703-1 Certificate of compliance might accompany a welded steel railing.  
The term manufacturer’s designation refers to an identification applied on a product by the  
manufacturer indicating that a product or material complies with a specified standard or set of  
rules. An example of a manufacturer’s designation would be the designation on ASTM A706  
reinforcing bars where the “W” indicates the bars conform to the ASTM A706 standard for  
weldable rebar. See Figure 1703-2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1703-2 Required marking for ASTM A706 \(weldable\) reinforcing bars.  
The term Label refers to an identification applied to a product by an approved agency  
containing the name of the manufacturer, the function, and the performance characteristics, and  
indicates that the product or material has been inspected and evaluated by an approved agency.  
Examples of a labels are shown in Figure 1703-3.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1703-3 Examples of lumber, panel, and engineered wood product labels.  
1703.4.1 Research and investigation. This section is intended to implement the requirements of  
Section 104.11 for use of innovative or alternative materials, design, and methods of  
construction. For example, an innovative prestressed concrete system that does not emulate the  
performance of cast-in-place concrete could be evaluated in accordance with this section. Note  
that the section requires that the costs of collecting data and preparing reports are to be borne by  
the applicant.  
1703.4.2 Research reports. This section is identical to Section 104.11.1 regarding the use of  
innovative or alternative materials, design, and methods of construction. Evaluation reports  
prepared by approved agencies, such as those published by the organizations affiliated with the  
model code groups, may be accepted as part of the data needed by the building official to form  
the basis of approval of a material or product not specifically covered by the code. ICC  
Evaluation Service Reports are considered by many building officials to be the most  
straightforward method for the building official to review products and systems that are not  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationspecifically covered by the code. Such reports supplement the resources of the building official  
and eliminate the need for the official to conduct detailed analysis on every new product that is  
not covered by the code or a referenced standard. Because evaluation reports issued by the model  
code-affiliated organizations are advisory in nature, the building official is not mandated to  
accept or approve them. Technically, such products and reports are approved under the  
alternative materials and methods of construction provisions of Section 104.11.  
1703.5 Labeling. When materials or assemblies are required to be labeled by the code, such as  
wood structural panels, rated sheathing, lumber, and fire doors, the labeling must be in  
accordance with the procedures outlined in this section and its subsections. Labeling of materials  
or assemblies is an indication that the materials or assemblies have been subjected to testing,  
inspection, and/or other operations by the labeling agency. The presence of a label does not  
necessarily indicate compliance with code requirements. For example, use of plywood siding,  
although labeled, would not comply with the code if Structural I sheathing was specified to resist  
the design lateral forces. The installation of labeled products must comply with the specific  
requirements and limitations of the label. For example, the actual span in the field for wood  
structural panel roof sheathing must meet the panel span rating shown on the label \(stamp\). See  
Figure 1703-3 for examples of typical lumber, panel and engineered wood product labels.  
Another example is a fire-rated door that is labeled with the hardware requirements specified on  
the label. The building inspector must ensure that the hardware used in the installation of the  
door meets the labeling requirements to ensure that the door complies with the code.  
See Section 202 for the definition of the terms label and labeled.  
1703.5.1 Testing. For a material or product to be labeled, the labeling agency is required to  
perform specific testing on representative samples of the material or product in accordance with  
the applicable standards referenced by the code. For example, quality-control testing for strength  
and stiffness of machine stress-rated lumber to ensure that the products meet structural  
requirements in accordance with the American Lumber Standard system. Another example is  
factory-built fireplace assemblies that must be tested in accordance with the requirements of UL  
127 \(see Chapter 35\).  
1703.5.2 Inspection and identification. The approved agency whose label is applied to a  
material or product must perform periodic inspections of the manufacture of the material or  
product to determine that the manufacturer is indeed producing the same material or product as  
tested and labeled. For example, if the labeling agency had tested ½-inch \(12.7 mm\) C-C  
plywood sheathing made with five plies but the manufacturer was now making the plywood with  
only three plies, the agency would need to withdraw the use of its label and listing.  
1703.5.3 Label information. This section specifies the minimum information necessary on a  
label for the building inspector to determine that the installed material conforms to the approved  
plans. See Figure 1703-3 for examples of typical lumber, panel, and engineered wood product  
labels. The manufacturer \(mill number\), the performance characteristics \(grade or category\),  
standards or evaluation reports, and approved agency are shown.  
1703.5.4 Method of labeling. This section specifies that labels that are required to be permanent  
must be of a nature that once applied, their removal would cause the label to be destroyed.  
Examples of labels that are required to be permanent are fire-resistive glazing and opening  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprotectives.  
1703.6 Evaluation and follow-up inspections. This provision applies where a structural  
component cannot be inspected after completion of a prefabricated assembly. An example might  
be a prefabricated shear wall consisting of wood structural panel sheathing over a welded steel  
frame; the welding must be inspected prior to the installation of the sheathing and the entire  
assembly must be inspected after it is fabricated. The testing and inspection should follow the  
provisions described in Section 1703.6.  
Section 1704 Special Inspections and Tests, Contractor  
# Responsibility, and Structural Observations  
This section provides administrative requirements for special inspections and tests \(1704.2\),  
preparation and submittal of the statement of special inspections \(1704.3\), the contractor’s  
statement of responsibility \(1704.4\), submittals to the building official \(1704.5\), and structural  
observation by the registered design professional \(1704.6\).  
One of the oldest mechanisms for providing quality assurance in construction is the process  
known as special inspection. The purpose of special inspection is to ensure proper fabrication,  
installation, and placement of components or materials that require special knowledge or  
expertise, such as welding of structural steel or placement of grouted masonry. The knowledge  
and duties of a special inspector differ from that of the jurisdiction building inspector in that the  
special inspector’s expertise is narrower in scope, such as that of a structural steel welding or  
prestressed concrete special inspector. Another difference is the special inspector is required to  
be present during certain field operations, whereas the jurisdiction inspector may not be present.  
The special inspection requirements in the IBC address three areas\:  
1\. Adequacy or quality of materials, such as concrete strength.  
2\. Adequacy of fabrication, such as verification of manufacturer’s certified test reports.  
3\. Adequacy of construction techniques, such as proper placement of reinforcing.  
Special inspection is that category of inspection requiring special knowledge, special  
attention, or both. The knowledge required is generally more specialized than that required by a  
general building inspector. An individual with a high degree of specialized knowledge is  
generally required; hence, the term special inspection.  
Most building departments do not have the staff necessary to do detailed inspections on large  
or complex structures, nor do the permit fees allow the level of inspection necessary for the types  
of construction where extra care in quality control must be exercised to ensure compliance with  
the code. In some cases, the special inspection must be continuous during a particular operation,  
such as pretensioning high-strength bolts or making complete penetration groove welds. Hence,  
there is a need for a special inspector with specialized expertise who can be there continuously  
during a particular operation.  
ICC offers a publication titled Special Inspection Manual that provides the building official  
with guidance on the administration and implementation of the special inspection requirements  
of the IBC. The guidance is based on recommended practices and the consensus of building  
officials and design professionals, as well as inspection and testing agencies. The duties and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationresponsibilities of the building official, special inspector, project owner, engineer or architect of  
record, contractor, and building official are covered in the guide. Suggested forms are also  
included that can be easily adapted to the specific needs of the jurisdiction. Examples of  
checklist documents for special inspection are also included.  
Note that in addition to the general special inspection requirements in Section 1705, there are  
additional special inspection requirements in Section 1705.11 that specifically apply to wind  
resistance, and in Section 1705.12 that specifically apply to seismic resistance.  
1704.1 General. This section outlines the general requirements for special inspections, the  
statement of special inspections, contractor’s statement of responsibility, submittals to the  
building official, and structural observations. The actual inspections and verifications required  
are contained in Section 1705.  
1704.2 Special inspections and tests. The owner is responsible for the employment of special  
inspectors meeting the approval of the building official and all costs associated with the  
employment of special inspectors. Note that the special inspectors must be employed by the  
owner, or the responsible registered design professional acting as the owner’s agent, not by the  
contractor or builder. This ensures independence of the special inspector and avoids any potential  
conflict of interest that could occur if the special inspector were employed by the contractor or  
builder. Note that the special inspections required by Chapter 17 are in addition to, not in lieu of,  
the jurisdiction inspections required by Section 110.  
There are exceptions to the requirement for special inspections for minor work or work not  
required to be designed or sealed by a registered design professional such as Group U  
occupancies accessory to a residence, and prescriptive cold-formed steel or wood light frame  
construction. Engineered seismic-force-resisting systems are very common in residential  
structures in Seismic Design Categories D, E, and F. Group R-3 occupancies often have  
components that require special inspection such as high-load diaphragms, high-strength concrete,  
structural steel frames, high-strength bolting, complete penetration groove welds, engineered  
masonry, and deep \(pile\) foundation systems. The exemption for Group U occupancies accessory  
to a residential occupancy is for those structures that are typically not required to be designed by  
a registered design professional or those designed and constructed in accordance with the  
International Residential Code® \(IRC®\). Exception 1 does not necessarily mean that inspections  
are not required, only that they are not required to be made by a special inspector. However, the  
above comments regarding structural systems used in the R-3 occupancies could also apply to U  
occupancies. It is not inconceivable that a large private garage could have structural components  
that would require special inspection.  
Exception 1 refers to “conditions in the jurisdiction” as a possible exception. The primary  
conditions envisioned by the code in this case refer either to the jurisdiction having the resources  
and skill level necessary to perform the requisite special inspection tasks, thus obviating the need  
for a special inspector hired by the owner, or the work is of a minor nature in the opinion of the  
building official. Note that this exception for special inspection cannot be invoked by the owner.  
One purpose of the exception is to allow jurisdictions to perform special inspections if the  
jurisdiction so desires. Exception 3 waives special inspection for prescriptive light-frame  
construction of cold-formed steel or conventional wood structures. Section 2211.7 applies to  
prescriptively framed detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses less than or equal  
to three stories constructed of cold-formed steel in accordance with AISI S230. Exception 4  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationacknowledges that a contractor is allowed to hire the special inspector when the contractor is also  
the owner of the structure.  
1704.2.1 Special inspector qualifications. Special inspectors are required to be qualified and  
demonstrate competence to the satisfaction of the building official. The registered design  
professional acting as an approved agency may provide special inspection for work designed by  
them, provided they demonstrate to the building official that they are qualified to perform the  
special inspections involved.  
1704.2.2 Access for special inspection. This section requiring access to the construction  
specifically applies to special inspection.  
1704.2.3 Statement of special inspections. The permit applicant must submit a detailed  
statement outlining the required special inspections and designate those who will perform the  
special inspections. In general, the responsible registered design professional is required to  
prepare the statement of special inspections, because the special inspections relate directly to the  
design and construction documents required by Sections 107.1 and 1603. The statement of  
special inspections must conform to the detailed requirements described in Section 1704.3. The  
exception in Section 1704.2.3 allows the statement of special inspections to be waived for  
prescriptive light-frame construction of cold-formed steel or conventional wood structures. The  
exception in Section 1704.3 allows the statement of special inspections to be prepared by a  
qualified person instead of a registered design professional where approved by the building  
official for construction that is not designed by or required to be designed by a registered design  
professional.  
Although a statement of special inspections is not required for cold-formed steel structures  
constructed in accordance with the provisions of Section 2211.7 or conventional wood frame  
structures constructed in accordance with the prescriptive provisions of Section 2308, it should  
be noted that Sections 2308.1.1 and 2308.4 permit portions and elements of an otherwise  
conventional building to be designed in accordance with the engineering provisions of the code;  
therefore, these engineered elements and portions could require special inspection. For example,  
an otherwise conventional wood frame residence that uses a steel moment frame to resist lateral  
forces at the clear story entrance foyer. Such an element is outside of the conventional  
construction provisions, requires engineering under Section 2308.4, and could require special  
inspection under Section 1705.2.  
1704.2.4 Report requirement. Records of each inspection must be kept and submitted to the  
building official so as to document compliance with the code. The records must include all  
inspections made and compliance with the code requirements, as well as all discrepancies or  
violations. A final report must show that all required special inspections have been made and that  
discrepancies have been resolved before a certificate of occupancy can be issued by the building  
official. It is the responsibility of the special inspector to document and submit inspection  
records to the building official and to the registered design professional in responsible charge.  
The final special inspection report documenting resolution of discrepancies must be submitted at  
a time agreed upon by the permit applicant and the building official prior to the commencement  
of work.  
1704.2.5 Special inspection of fabricated items. Unless structural items are fabricated by an  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationapproved fabricator as described in the exceptions, special inspection is required during the  
fabrication process. See Section 1704.2.5.1 regarding fabricator approval requirements.  
1704.2.5.1 Fabricator approval. Special inspection at a fabrication plant is not required where a  
fabricator has been specifically approved by the building official. This approval may be based on  
available third-party accreditations, previously listed \(“approved agency”\), or by the building  
official’s own review of the fabricator’s written procedures and quality assurance/quality control  
program. The fabricator should be periodically audited by an independent, approved special  
inspection agency. This section is intended to apply to fabricators accredited by organizations  
such as IAS, the AISC Certification Program for Structural Steel Fabricators, the Plant  
Certification Program for steel joists by the Steel Joist Institute, or the Plant Certification  
Program for precast concrete products by the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute. Some  
premanufactured low-rise metal building manufacturers meet both the AISC Certification  
Program for Structural Steel Fabricators and the IAS Fabricator Inspection Program and are  
recognized by most building officials as having the appropriate personnel, organization,  
experience, knowledge, and equipment to produce the quality required for structural steel  
buildings.  
This section states that these items “provide a basis for control of materials and  
workmanship.  
” Having these procedures in place in addition to having periodic third-party audits  
provides assurance to the building department that the quality of materials and workmanship  
meet the intent of Chapter 17, therefore allowing approved fabricators to be exempt from the  
special inspection provisions.  
An important item that is often overlooked in relation to approved fabricators is the certificate  
of compliance. Upon completion of fabrication, the fabricator is to provide the building official  
with a certificate noting that the item has been fabricated in accordance with the approved plans.  
Figure 1704-1 is a sample certificate of compliance that is used by the City of San Diego. This  
certificate provides the building official and the owner with a level of assurance that the item was  
constructed correctly, similar to the final special inspection report for a project.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1704-1 Fabricator certificate of compliance.  
1704.3 Statement of special inspections. When special inspections are required by Section  
1705, the registered design professional is required to prepare a detailed statement of special  
inspections. There are many areas where it has been simply assumed that this is the engineer of  
record for the project. Chapter 17 now requires special inspections for several nonstructural  
components. As such, this statement of special inspection should actually be developed by the  
entire design team, with input from the architect, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, and  
the structural engineer.  
After the statement has been developed, it is the responsibility of the permit applicant to  
provide the statement to the building official as a condition of the permit issuance \(see Section  
1704.2.3\). In some regions this statement is included on the construction plans while in others it  
is provided to the building department as a separate document, similar to project specifications.  
1704.3.1 Content of statement of special inspections. The statement of special inspections  
must identify the work requiring special inspection or testing. It should include the type and  
extent of each special inspection or test and indicate whether the inspections are to be continuous  
or periodic. Where required, the statement also includes the additional special inspection or  
testing requirements for wind or seismic resistance as prescribed by Sections 1705.11, 1705.12,  
and 1705.13. A sample project-specific statement of special inspections is provided as an  
example at the end of this chapter.  
1704.3.2 Seismic requirements in the statement of special inspections. The statement of  
special inspections must include elements of the SFRS, the designated seismic system and  
additional systems, components listed in Section 1705.12, and the seismic testing and  
qualifications required by Section 1705.13. The terms “seismic-force-resisting system” and  
“designated seismic system” are defined in Section 202.  
1704.3.3 Wind requirements in the statement of special inspections. The statement of special  
inspections must identify the elements of the MWFRS and components and cladding \(that are  
subject to special inspection\) where the allowable stress design wind speed, Vasd , meets the  
criteria specified in Section 1705.11. See discussion under Section 1609 for descriptions of the  
allowable stress design wind speed and Exposure Categories.  
1704.4 Contractor responsibility. The intent of the section is to require the contractor  
responsible for construction of the MWFRS, the seismic-force-resisting system, the designated  
seismic system, and those wind-resisting components listed in the statement of special  
inspections to submit a statement of responsibility to the owner and building official. The  
statement of responsibility is to be submitted prior to commencement of work on a particular  
structural system or component, and must acknowledge awareness of special requirements  
contained in the statement of special inspections. This statement of responsibility is considered  
as a central part of a long-standing national effort to improve construction quality for seismic and  
wind resistance by stressing the contractor’s role in providing adequate quality control during the  
construction process. The intent of the statement of responsibility is to ensure that the contractor  
acknowledges awareness of special requirements contained in the statement of special  
inspections related to the lateral-force-resisting systems for wind and seismic loads.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1704.5 Submittals to the building official. This section itemizes all the reports and  
certifications that must be submitted to the building official. Having all these reports and  
certifications listed in one section helps clarify the requirements.  
1704.6 Structural observations. The purpose of structural observation is to ensure that critical  
elements of the lateral-force-resisting system are constructed in general conformance with the  
design as shown in the approved structural drawings and specifications. Because the registered  
design professional is most familiar with the design and the details of the lateral-force-resisting  
system, he or she is the most appropriate person to execute the requisite observations.  
Structural observation consists of visual observation of specific structural systems by the  
registered design professional for general conformance with the approved construction  
documents at significant construction stages and at the completion of the structural system. The  
structural observer is expected to “visually” observe systems, details, and load paths. Structural  
observation is separate and distinct from special inspections. Special inspections are very  
detailed inspections of components and materials within structural systems.  
Structural observations are broad, general, visual overviews of a bigger picture. Broad  
knowledge of structural design issues and specific knowledge of their application to the project  
are necessary. An observation answers the question,  
“Is the structural frame of the building being  
built as directed within the construction documents?” Structural observation does not include or  
waive inspections performed by the jurisdiction as required by Section 110 or special inspections  
required by Section 1705. See the definition of “Structural observation” in Section 202.  
1704.6.1 Structural observations for structures. Structural observations are required for all  
Risk Category III or IV structures, for high-rise buildings, when specifically required by the  
design professional, and when specifically required by the building official. If the project is  
located within Seismic Design Category E and is greater than two stories above the grade plane,  
structural observations are required regardless of the Risk Category of the building.  
Risk Category III and IV Occupancies are defined in Table 1604.5, which also provides  
several examples of essential facilities and buildings or other structures that represent a  
substantial hazard to human life in the event of failure. Given the relative risk and hazard, it is  
appropriate to require that a structural engineer conduct site visits to verify general conformance  
to the design intent for these types of structures. Observations for seismic- or wind-resisting  
systems and load paths are performed by the same registered design professional that observes  
gravity systems and load paths. Lateral force–resisting systems and load paths are integrated with  
gravity force–resisting systems, components, and cladding so there is no differentiation of “wind  
or seismic resistance observations” from “Structural Observations.  
”  
Prior to performing structural observations, the observer is required to notify the building  
official in writing of the frequency and extent of structural observations. At the conclusion of  
work, the structural observer is required to submit a written statement that the site visits have  
been made and identify any unresolved deficiencies that may exist.  
Section 1705 Required Special Inspections and Tests  
All general administrative requirements related to special inspections, the statement of special  
inspections, contractor responsibility, and structural observations are contained in Section 1704.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1705.1.1 Special cases. Special inspection is required for proposed work that is unique or  
unusual in nature and products or systems that are not specifically addressed in the code or in  
standards referenced by the code. This section is used to apply special inspection requirements to  
items that are not specifically covered in the code but are approved under the alternate design  
and methods of construction provisions in Section 104.11. Many ICC Evaluation Service Reports  
\(ESR\) for structural products require special inspection in accordance with this section. For  
example, ESR 2302 for the Hilti Kwik Bolt 3 requires periodic special inspection during  
installation.  
1705.2 Steel construction. This section sets forth the special inspection requirements for the  
fabrication and erection of steel structures. Special inspection requirements for structural steel  
are in accordance with the quality assurance and inspection requirements in ANSI/AISC 360  
Specification for Structural Steel Buildings. The special inspection requirements in the code  
pertain to steel structures other than structural steel, such as cold-formed steel, sheet steel, and  
reinforcing.  
The exception eliminates the need for special inspection of steel structures in certain cases.  
Special inspection is not required if the fabricator does not alter the properties of the parent  
material by welding, thermal cutting, or heating operations. For example, if the members being  
fabricated were cut by mechanical means, such as a band saw, and punched or drilled for bolt  
holes, with no application of heat, special inspection would not be required. But if the same  
members were cut with an oxy-acetylene torch, special inspection would be required. Even if  
special inspection is not required, the fabricator must provide evidence that tracking procedures  
are adequate to verify that the material used to fabricate any member meets the required  
specification, is of the proper grade, and has an associated mill certificate of compliance. Testing  
may be required if the mill certificate is separated from the materials or is otherwise missing \(see  
Figure 1705-1\).  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1705-1 Bend test on No. 18 rebar per ASTM A370.  
1705.2.1 Structural steel. As noted above, the section references the quality assurance  
provisions of AISC 360 for special inspection of structural steel. AISC 360 Chapter N includes  
comprehensive quality control and quality assurance requirements for structural steel  
construction, including requirements pertaining to the structural steel fabricator and erector, as  
well as quality assurance requirements pertaining to the owner’s inspecting and/or testing  
agencies. The requirements in AISC 360 are similar to those that were incorporated into AISC  
341 Appendix Q. AISC 360 Chapter N provides the foundation for the quality control and  
quality assurance requirements for general structural steel construction, along with AISC 341  
Chapter J, thereby extending specific requirements to high-seismic applications. The inspection  
requirements in AISC 360 of the quality assurance inspector are generally equivalent to those  
specified for the special inspector in IBC Chapter 17.  
1705.2.2 Cold-formed steel deck. A Standard for Quality Control and Quality Assurance for  
Installation of Steel Deck \(SDI QA/QC\) is referenced for inspection of steel floor and roof decks.  
The SDI QA/QC standard contains provisions for quality assurance inspection of steel floor and  
roof deck, which are coordinated with the requirements of AISC 360. The standard clarifies the  
scope of required inspections and responsibilities of both the installer’s quality control personnel  
and quality assurance inspector, and contains tables of inspection tasks that specifically list  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationinspection requirements for material verification, deck installation, welding, and mechanical  
fastening. This standard references AWS D1.3 for weld quality and requiring material  
verification.  
1705.2.3 Open-web steel joists and joist girders. The structural design and installation of open-  
web steel joist and joist girder systems warrants special inspection by personnel with sufficient  
expertise and approval by the building official having the necessary competence to inspect the  
installation of steel joist systems. Examples of important items that require special inspection are  
bearing seat attachments, field splices, and bridging attachments. Where steel joist systems are  
used in roof and floor diaphragms, chords and collectors are important critical elements of the  
lateral-force-resisting system. Although the standard specifications for open-web steel joists and  
joist girders \(SJI 100\) and composite steel joists \(SJI 200\) by the Steel Joist Institute \(SJI\)  
contain provisions for inspections, they are limited to quality control inspections by the  
manufacturer before shipment to verify compliance and workmanship with the specifications.  
Quality control and assurance are discussed in Section 2207.1 as shown in the table. Although  
sections of the SJI standards noted above are also referenced in Section 4 of the Code of  
Standard Practice for Steel Joists and Joist Girders \(SJI-COSP\) and the Code of Standard  
Practice for Composite Steel Joists \(SJI-CJCOSP\), these SJI codes of standard practice are not  
directly referenced in the IBC.  
Table 1705.2.3 Required Special Inspections of Open-web Steel Joists and Joist Girders.  
This table specifies what items require special inspection, whether continuous or periodic, and  
gives a reference to the applicable standard listed in Section 2207.1. Note that the inspections are  
periodic meaning that the special inspector can do the inspection after installation and need not  
necessarily be present during the operation.  
1705.2.4 Cold-formed steel trusses spanning 60 feet or greater. This section requires special  
inspection for cold-formed steel trusses spanning more than 60 feet \(18,288 mm\). Because long-  
span trusses have significant loads and support reactions, proper installation and bracing is of  
critical importance. The special inspector must verify that the temporary and permanent truss  
bracings are installed in accordance with the approved truss engineering and submittal package.  
A similar requirement exists for metal-plate-connected wood trusses in Section 1705.5.2.  
1705.3 Concrete construction. This section provides the special inspection and verification  
requirements for concrete construction such as buildings, foundations, and other elements.  
Detailed requirements are covered in Table 1705.3, which provides the specific verification and  
inspection requirements, whether the frequency of inspection is to be continuous or periodic, the  
applicable referenced standard, and/or the IBC code section where appropriate. Exceptions for  
special inspection are isolated spread footings for buildings three stories or less in height, lightly  
loaded elements such as slabs on grade and concrete foundations such as conventional  
foundations for light-frame construction and nonstructural concrete flatwork such as sidewalks,  
patios, and driveways. Where certain criteria are met, Exceptions 1 and 2 exempt conventional  
foundations, either spread \(pad\) footings or continuous footings, for buildings three stores or less  
in height. Under Exception 2, Item 2.3 exempts continuous concrete footings from special  
inspection where the structural design of the footing is based on a concrete strength of 2,500 psi  
\(17.2 MPa\), even if a higher compressive strength is specified in the construction documents for  
other reasons such as durability. This allows engineers to specify a higher concrete strength as a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmatter of preference even if a 2,500-psi \(17.2 MPa\) design strength is used for sizing footings.  
Note that Section 1808.8.1 requires a specified concrete strength of 3,000 psi \(20.7 MPa\) for  
foundations in Seismic Design Category D, E, or F. This means that foundation concrete in  
Seismic Design Category D or higher must be designed for a specified concrete strength of 3,000  
psi \(20.7 MPa\) concrete, and therefore special inspection is required. However, Table 1808.8.1  
allows a specified concrete strength of 2,500 psi \(17.2 MPa\) for Group R or U of light-frame  
construction two stories or less in height for foundations in Seismic Design Category D, E, or F.  
Therefore, 2,500 psi \(17.2 MPa\) concrete is permitted for these structures, and special inspection  
would not be required.  
Concrete basement or foundation walls constructed in accordance with the prescriptive  
provisions in Section 1807.1.6.2 are not required to be engineered and are also exempt from  
special inspection.  
1705.3.1 Welding of Reinforcing Bars. This section clarifies special inspection requirements  
for welds of reinforcing bars. While the majority of the special inspection requirements for  
concrete derive from ACI 318, all items related to the welding of reinforcing steel are outlined in  
AWS D1.4. This includes not only the actual special inspections that are to be performed, but  
also the qualifications for the special inspectors.  
1705.3.2 Material tests. Constituent materials for concrete such as aggregate, cement,  
admixtures, and water must conform to the requirements set forth in Section 1903 and the  
standards of Chapter 3 of ACI 318. When sufficient documentation is not available to verify that  
constituent materials conform to these requirements, the building official should require testing  
of the materials.  
Table 1705.3 Required Special Inspections and Tests of Concrete Construction. Table  
1705.3 presents the requirements for special inspection of concrete structures in a concise format  
along with the inspection frequency, applicable referenced standard, and/or code section. The  
table summarizes the required inspections and test samples necessary to verify that the in-place  
concrete meets code requirements. Refer to ACI 318 and the applicable ASTM standards for  
more details on constituent material tests, sampling of fresh concrete, testing of slump or air  
content, casting of test specimens, and other test requirements.  
Item 1—Reinforcement. Inspections of reinforcing should verify that tendons and  
reinforcement are of the correct size and grade, as required by the approved drawings and  
specifications, and is properly placed prior to placement of concrete. Proper placement of  
reinforcement has a significant impact on the integrity and strength of reinforced concrete. The  
reinforcement should be placed within the tolerances set forth in ACI 318 and ACI 117,  
Standard Tolerances for Concrete Construction and Materials. Additional requirements of ACI  
318, such as surface conditions of reinforcement, spacing limitations, and concrete protection for  
reinforcement or cover, must also be checked.  
Item 2—Welding reinforcement. Item 2, inspection of reinforcing steel welding, refers to AWS  
D1.4 and ACI 318, for requirements pertaining to welding reinforcing steel.  
Item 3—Cast-in-place anchors. Item 3 comes into effect when anchor bolts are cast in  
concrete. Proper placement and embedment of anchor bolts is of extreme importance. If an  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationanchor bolt is set too low for proper thread engagement, there are few satisfactory methods to  
remedy the situation. The common practice of placing a puddle weld in the nut is of questionable  
value, as neither the bolt nor the nut may actually be weldable material. The chemistry of nuts is  
not controlled by the ASTM requirements, and the chemistry allowed for an ordinary A307 bolt  
is such that it may or may not be weldable. In either case, the weld is not a prequalified weld in  
accordance with AWS D1.1 Structural Welding Code—Steel, and a Procedure Qualification  
Record should be developed to qualify the welding procedure. Note also that if the anchor bolt is  
a high-strength bolt such as an ASTM A325 or ASTM A449, the bolt is quenched and tempered,  
and application of heat by welding may alter the strength of the bolt and make the bolt brittle.  
Item 4—Post-installed anchors. Item 4 requires special inspection for all anchors post-installed  
in hardened concrete. Continuous special inspection for post-installed adhesive anchors in  
hardened concrete where the anchors are installed in horizontally or upwardly inclined  
orientations and are designed to resist sustained tension loads. All other adhesive and mechanical  
anchors require periodic special inspection. Footnote b accounts for post-installed anchors  
approved through the alternate methods of construction provisions of Section 104.11, such as  
anchors installed in accordance with ICC Evaluation Service Reports. It is also intended to  
distinguish between the requirements for special inspection of anchors designed to comply with  
the IBC alone versus those qualified by approved research reports in accordance with ACI 355.2,  
Qualification of Post-Installed Mechanical Anchors in Concrete. Typically, items requiring  
special inspection that are approved under Section 104.11 are covered by Section 1705.1.1,  
Special Cases. Where special inspection requirements are not provided in a research report, the  
special inspection requirements must be specified by the registered design professional, who  
would indicate whether inspections are continuous or periodic, and be approved by the building  
official prior to commencement of the work.  
Item 5—Design mix. Item 5 is a particularly important verification on larger projects that may  
have many required mix designs with differing strength requirements and aggregate sizes.  
Item 6—Concrete testing. Sampling of fresh concrete for making specimens for strength tests is  
extremely important for proper quality control. Properly sampled and prepared specimens are  
necessary to determine that the concrete will meet or exceed the design strength. The frequency  
of sampling should be in accordance with ACI 318 Section 26.12.2—one set of specimens for  
each class of concrete not less than once per day, once per 150 cubic yards \(115 m3\), or once per  
5,000 square feet \(465 m2\) of slab or wall. Sampling should be done in accordance with ASTM C  
172 to ensure representative samples for determining compressive strength. The tests specified in  
Item 6 may be supplemented by other tests such as unit weight or air content.  
Item 7—Concrete placement. Observation of the actual placement is important to determine  
that the fresh concrete is properly handled so that it does not segregate during placement and that  
the concrete is properly consolidated by vibration. The mixing, conveying, and depositing  
requirements \(see ACI 318 Section 26.5\) should be strictly enforced to ensure proper placement  
with adequate consolidation and without segregation. Concrete voids or rock pockets can  
adversely affect design strength and are unattractive.  
Item 8—Curing. Maintenance of proper cure is essential to obtaining quality concrete that will  
reach the design strength. Concrete that is not properly cured often will be below design strength  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand may suffer degradation at the surface from use or from environmental effects much earlier  
than properly cured concrete.  
Item 9—Prestressed concrete. The inspections required by Item 9 are of extreme importance as  
the strength of a prestressed member is highly dependent on proper prestressing. When checking  
the application of prestressing force, both the force applied to the tendon and the tendon  
elongation should be checked simultaneously to ensure that the tendon has not been hung up in  
the tendon sheath. See ACI 318 Section 26.10.  
Item 10—Precast concrete. Criteria for the erection procedures of precast concrete must be  
provided on the design drawing by the design engineer. The drawings should identify each panel  
to be cast and should specify\: dimensions and thickness of panels, reinforcement grade, size and  
location, location of inserts, and minimum concrete strength at lifting and in-service. The special  
inspector should ensure that the erection process complies with the approved procedures. See  
ACI 318 Section 26.9.  
Item 11—Precast Concrete Diaphragm Connections and Reinforcement. ACI 318 has  
provisions for design of precast concrete diaphragms in Section 18.12.11. Such diaphragms are  
required to comply with the requirements of ACI 550.5. ACI 318 Section 26.13.1.3 and ACI  
550.5 have continuous special inspection requirements for precast concrete diaphragm  
connections or reinforcement at joints classified as medium or high deformability elements  
\(MDE or HDE\), installation of embedded parts, completion of the continuity of reinforcement  
across joints, and completion of connections in the field in structures assigned to SDC C, D, E  
and F.  
Item 12—Precast Concrete Diaphragm Connection Installation Tolerances. ACI 318  
Section 26.13.1.3 requires that installation tolerances of precast concrete diaphragm connections  
be periodically inspected for compliance with ACI 550.5.  
Item 13—Concrete strength. Concrete strength must be verified prior to stressing tendons used  
in post-tensioned concrete. Form supports for prestressed concrete should not be removed until  
sufficient prestressing has been applied. Forms and shoring for conventionally reinforced  
concrete members such as beams and structural slabs should not be removed until adequate  
concrete strength is achieved. See ACI 318 Section 26.11.2 for requirements related to removal  
of formwork.  
Item 14—Formwork. Inspection of concrete forms for proper shape, dimensions, and location  
is essential for adequate performance on concrete members such as beams, columns, walls, and  
structural slabs. See ACI 318 Section 26.11 for general requirements related to formwork.  
1705.4 Masonry construction. The Masonry Society is responsible for developing the structural  
masonry standards referenced in the IBC. The two main referenced standards developed by TMS  
are the Building Code Requirements for Masonry Structures \(TMS 402\) and the Specifications  
for Masonry Structures \(TMS 602\). These documents are often referred to as the MSJC Code  
and MSJC Specification. The level of quality assurance required by Section 3.1 of the TMS 402  
is driven by the type of masonry used and the risk category of the structure. Table 1705-1 reflects  
the level of quality assurance required based on the type of masonry and risk category of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstructure.  
Table 1705-1. Level of Quality Assurance Required by MSJC Code Section 3.1  
There are three exemptions from special inspection for masonry structures. Empirically  
designed masonry, glass unit masonry, or masonry veneer in Risk Category I, II, or III structures  
are exempt from special inspection when constructed in accordance with Sections 2109, 2110, or  
Chapter 14. Note that the TMS 402 requires Level 1 quality assurance for these structures, which  
requires no specific testing and only consists of verification of certificates of compliance for  
masonry materials in accordance with TMS 602 Article 1.5. The other two exceptions are for  
masonry foundation walls constructed in accordance with the prescriptive tables of Section  
1807.1.6, which do not require engineering, and masonry fireplaces, chimneys, and heaters  
constructed in accordance with Section 2111, 2112, or 2113.  
1705.4.1 Glass unit masonry and masonry veneer in Risk Category IV. Special inspection for  
glass unit masonry and masonry veneer in Risk Category IV structures must comply with TMS  
602 Level 2 Quality Assurance requirements. See Table 4 of the TMS 602 for specific details. As  
noted, Table 1705-1 shows the level of quality assurance required based on the type of masonry  
and risk category of the structure. TMS 402, Section A.1.2.4 \(empirical design of masonry\)  
specifically prohibits the use of empirical design in structures assigned to Risk Category IV.  
Glass unit masonry and masonry veneer are allowed in buildings such as fire houses, emergency  
operation centers and hospitals and installation of this type of masonry requires special  
inspections.  
1705.4.2 Vertical masonry foundation elements. The intent of this section is that the special  
inspection requirements for vertical masonry foundation elements are as noted in Section 1705.4  
and its subsections. In other words, vertical masonry foundation elements may be required to  
comply with quality assurance and inspection provisions of TMS 602, they may be required to  
only comply with the Level 2 Quality Assurance requirements prescribed in Section 1705.4.1, or  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthey may be exempt from special inspection in accordance with one of the exceptions. Section  
1808.9 references the TMS 402 for design requirements for vertical masonry foundation  
elements.  
1705.5 Wood construction. This section requires special inspection for certain types of wood  
construction. The requirement is for inspection of prefabricated elements such as wood trusses  
and refers to Section 1704.2.5 regarding special inspection of fabricators. For portions of wood  
structures designated as the SFRS, see also the special inspection requirements for wind and  
seismic resistance discussed in the analysis of Sections 1705.11 and 1705.12. Special inspection  
is required for site-built assemblies, high-load diaphragms, and wood trusses having a depth of  
more than 60 inches or a span of greater than 60 feet \(18,288 mm\). See Table 1705-1.  
Table 1705-1. Wood Construction Special Inspections  
1705.5.1 High-load diaphragms. When lateral loads become significant, designers often use  
high-load diaphragms, which have multiple rows of fasteners. Proper construction of high-load  
diaphragms is critical so this section requires periodic special inspection. Design values for high-  
load diaphragms fastened with nails are in Table 4.2B of the Special Design Provisions for Wind  
and Seismic \(SDPWS\), and high-load diaphragms fastened with staples are in Table 2306.2\(2\).  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe special inspector is required to inspect the diaphragm for proper sheathing grade and  
thickness; proper size, species, and grade of framing members; and proper fastener type, size,  
spacing, and edge distance from sheathing and framing members.  
1705.5.2 Metal-plate-connected wood trusses spanning 60 feet or greater. Any trusses having  
spans of 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) or more require periodic special inspections. Special inspections  
are required to ensure that temporary and permanent truss member bracing is installed in  
accordance with the approved truss package.  
1705.5.3 Mass timber construction. These provisions address special inspection provisions for  
mass timber elements in Types IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C construction. This unique type of  
construction requires a level of inspection consistent with other large buildings and applications.  
These special inspections are similar to what is required for other prefabricated systems such as  
precast concrete and structural steel. These provisions are not applicable to heavy timber \(IV-  
HT\) construction.  
Specific elements requiring periodic special inspection for construction Types IV-A, IV-B,  
and IV-C include\:  
1\. Connection of mass timber elements to timber deep foundation elements. These  
connections are critical to transfer loads from the mass timber elements to the piles,  
particularly for lateral loading. Connections to concrete foundations are addressed in  
IBC Table 1705.3, Item \#3.  
2\. Erection of mass timber elements. Similar to pre-cast concrete \(IBC Table 1705.3, Item  
\#10\), tall wood buildings utilizing prefabricated elements need to have verification that  
the correct elements are placed in the right location in accordance with the design  
drawings.  
3\. Specialized connections between mass timber products that utilize threaded, bolted, or  
concealed connections are considered periodic in a similar manner that concrete special  
inspections are required in Table 1705.3. The strength of many connection designs is  
predicated on specific screw lengths and installation angles. Bolted connections require  
specific diameters, and for lag screws, specific lengths. Concealed connectors, many of  
which are proprietary, must be installed correctly for structural performance.  
Adhesive anchorage installed in horizontal or upwardly inclined positions resisting tension  
loads shall be continuously inspected, similar to Table 1705.3, Item 4a. This is required because  
of issues with creep of adhesives under long-term tension loading. However, consistent with  
requirements for precast concrete, all other adhesive anchors need only be inspected periodically  
\(ref. Table 1705.3, Item 4b\).  
If there are other unusual items not covered in IBC Table 1705.5.3, the existing text in Section  
1705.1.1 gives the building official authority to require special inspections for those unusual  
items. The same section also says the building official can require special inspections where  
manufacturers’ installation instructions prescribe requirements not contained in the code. For  
example, field-glued mass timber beam or panel splices, while currently rare in North America,  
may become more prevalent in the future. This is not an item that is covered in IBC Table  
1705.5.3\. Section 1705.1.1 would allow the building official to require special inspections for  
either proprietary or non-proprietary field-glued splices. Note that many design engineers will  
also specify the need for special inspections for unusual conditions in their structural notes in the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconstruction documents, or in the statement of special inspections \(see Sections 1704.2.3 and  
1704.3\).  
1705.6 Soils. The table for verification and inspection of soils clarifies specific inspection tasks  
that are required for soils. This section covers special inspection requirements for soils such as  
site preparation, engineered fills, and materials supporting load-bearing foundations. The load-  
bearing capacity of the site soil and any fill has a significant impact on the structural integrity of  
a building supported by fill. For example, settlements in improperly compacted fill can cause  
significant structural distress. Differential settlements of ¼ inch \(6.35 mm\) in a 20-foot \(6,096  
mm\) grade beam can induce stresses that exceed the yield limits. Hence, fills should be  
engineered and compaction carefully controlled. The special inspection tasks outlined in Table  
1705.6 must be performed to verify compliance with the approved construction documents and  
the geotechnical report required by Section 1803.2. What is required to be included in  
geotechnical reports is covered in Section 1803.6.  
The special inspector is required to \(1\) verify that materials below footings are adequate to  
achieve the design bearing capacity; \(2\) verify that excavations are extended to the proper depth  
and have reached proper bearing material; \(3\) perform classification and testing of controlled fill  
materials; \(4\) verify use of proper materials, densities, and lift thicknesses during placement and  
compaction of controlled fill material; and \(5\) verify that the site and subgrade have been  
properly prepared prior to placement of controlled fill. The exception requires that the special  
inspector verify a minimum of 90-percent compaction.  
1705.7 Driven deep foundations. Special inspection is required for installation and testing of  
driven deep \(pile\) foundations. The special inspection tasks outlined in Table 1705.7 are required  
to verify compliance with the approved construction documents and the geotechnical report  
required by Section 1803.2. What is required to be included in geotechnical reports is covered in  
Section 1803.6. Table 1705.7 requires continuous special inspection to \(1\) verify that pile  
materials, sizes, and lengths comply with the requirements; \(2\) determine capacities of test piles  
and conduct additional load tests; \(3\) observe driving operations and maintain complete and  
accurate records for each pile; and \(4\) verify placement locations and plumbness, confirm type  
and size of hammer, record the number of blows per foot of penetration, determine required  
penetrations to achieve design capacity, record tip and butt elevations, and document any pile  
damage.  
For specialty piles, the special inspector must perform additional inspections in accordance  
with the registered design professional’s recommendations. It should also be noted that when a  
deep foundation system is required, the geotechnical engineer should specify the actual testing  
that is required in accordance with Section 1803.5.5.  
1705.8 Cast-in-place deep foundations. Table 1705.8 are required to verify compliance with  
the approved foundation and geotechnical report required by Section 1803.2. The table requires  
the special inspector to observe drilling operations and maintain complete and accurate records  
for each pile, and verify placement locations and plumbness, and confirm pile diameters, bell  
diameters \(if applicable\), lengths, embedment into bedrock \(if applicable\), and adequate end-  
bearing strata capacity. The volume of concrete or grout placed is often the first indicator of  
potentially significant problems during construction. Item 2 requires the special inspector to  
record the volumes of concrete or grout placed as a critical diagnostic tool. For concrete cast-in-  
place deep foundations, Item 3 of the table refers to Table 1705.3 for special inspection tasks  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrelated to concrete construction.  
Augered piles are drilled and then grouted in place. For each drilled pile, data should include  
a drilling log showing the types of soils encountered for each foot and the material stratum at the  
required tip elevation. The inspector should verify that the soil at the required tip elevation is the  
correct soil. The drilling log should also give information on the duration and cause of any  
delays, data on the rebar cage and concreting procedures, casing or other procedures necessary to  
prevent intrusion of ground water, and results of any concrete strength tests.  
1705.9 Helical pile foundations. Helical piles are deep foundation systems used for new  
construction, for foundation repair to mitigate structure settlement, or for tiebacks in shoring  
applications. Helical piles can be installed with a column of high-strength grout that encases the  
helical shaft to provide additional compressive and lateral load capacity. The section requires  
continuous special inspection during installation of helical pile systems. The installation  
procedure must be in accordance with the recommendations of the registered design professional  
and the approved geotechnical report.  
1705.10 Structural Integrity of Deep Foundation Elements. Significant defects affect the  
structural strength of deep foundation elements and need to be detected and corrected prior to  
further construction to prevent foundation failures. When the integrity of a deep foundation  
element is in doubt \(e.g., due to installation records or difficult soil conditions\), the deep  
foundation element should be tested during installation to assure no material defects. Sections  
1705.7, 1705.8, and 1705.9 address visual inspections. The ASTM tests specified in this section  
provide a means to assess portions of deep foundation elements that cannot be visually inspected.  
Most foundation failures are caused by inadequate geotechnical capacity. This section addresses  
other possible failure modes—namely lack of structural integrity.  
1705.11 Fabricated items. This section references Section 1704.2.5 for specific requirements  
pertaining to special inspection of fabricated items. See further discussion of fabricator approval  
under Section 1704.2.5.  
1705.12 Special inspection for wind resistance. Unless specifically exempted in the general  
requirements provided in Section 1704.2, special inspection for wind resistance is required for  
buildings sited in Exposure B where the allowable stress design wind speed \(V\) is 150 mph \(67  
m/sec\) or more, and Exposure C or D where the allowable stress design wind speed \(V\) is 140  
mph \(62.6 m/sec\) or more. The specific requirements apply to structural wood, cold-formed  
light-frame steel structures, and exterior cladding. The inspections are continuous or periodic  
depending on the type of structural elements involved. Table 1705-2 summarizes the  
requirements in Sections 1705.12.1 \(wood\), 1705.12.2 \(cold-formed steel\), and 1705.12.3  
\(cladding\). Damage to buildings due to high-wind forces often begins with the failure of the  
cladding system, which often exposes the MWFRS to damage from wind-driven rain and other  
forces that the wind-force-resisting system is typically not designed to resist.  
Table 1705-2. Special Inspection for Wind Resistance  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1705.12.1 Structural wood. Continuous special inspection is required for any field gluing of the  
MWFRS \(see Section 202 for definition of main wind force resisting system\). Periodic special  
inspection is required for fastening \(nailing, bolting, anchoring\) of elements of the MWFRS such  
as shear walls, diaphragms, chords, collectors \(drag struts\), braces, and hold-downs. The  
exception applies where the fastener spacing of the sheathing is more than 4 inches on center.  
1705.12.2 Cold-formed steel light-frame construction. Periodic special inspection is required  
for any welding of the MWFRS. Periodic special inspection is required for fastening \(screw  
attachment, bolting, anchoring\) of elements of the MWFRS such as shear walls, braces,  
diaphragms, chords, collectors \(drag struts\), and hold-downs. The first exception applies when  
the sheathing is gypsum board or fiberboard because of their relatively low load capacity.  
Similar to wood framing, the second exception applies where the fastener spacing of the  
sheathing is more than 4 inches \(102 mm\) on center.  
1705.12.3 Wind-resisting components. Damage to buildings in high-wind events often begins  
with failure of the cladding system. Thus, periodic special inspection is required for roof  
covering, the roof deck, and roof framing connections. Exterior wall covering and connections to  
the roof or floor diaphragms and framing also require periodic special inspection.  
1705.13 Special inspection for seismic resistance. Unless specifically exempted in the general  
requirements in Section 1704.2, special inspection for seismic resistance is required in addition  
to the general special inspection requirements covered in Section 1704. The requirements are  
triggered by the seismic design category of the building. Continuous special inspection is  
required for the SFRS for steel systems and elements, field gluing operations for structural wood  
elements, and cold-formed steel light-frame construction. Other items such as storage racks, base  
isolation systems, CFS special bolted moment frames, fastening of wood lateral-resisting  
systems, designated seismic systems, and architectural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical  
components require periodic special inspection. See a summary of special inspection  
requirements for seismic resistance in Table 1705-4.  
The SFRS consists of those structural elements and systems that provide lateral stability of the  
structure and are specifically designed to provide resistance to the anticipated seismic forces. The  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdesignated seismic system consists of those architectural, electrical, and mechanical systems and  
components that require design in accordance with Chapter 13 of ASCE 7 for which the  
component importance factor, Ip, is greater than 1.0, as prescribed in Section 13.1.3 of ASCE 7  
\(see Section 202\). Section 13.1.3 of ASCE 7 lists four classes of components that have a  
component importance factor of 1.5. These are components required to function after an  
earthquake including fire-sprinkler systems and egress stairways that are not an integral part of  
the building structure, components containing or conveying toxic materials, components in Risk  
Category IV structures that are deemed to be necessary for continued operation of the facility,  
and components containing or conveying hazardous materials. Refer to Section 13.1.3 of ASCE  
7 for complete descriptions of these systems.  
In addition to the general exceptions in Section 1704.2, there are three specific exceptions  
where special inspection for seismic resistance is not required\: Light-frame structures not over 35  
feet \(10,668 mm\) in height and in which SDS does not exceed 0.5; buildings with reinforced  
masonry or reinforced concrete seismic-force-resisting systems not over 25 feet \(7,620 mm\) and  
in which SDS does not exceed 0.5; and detached one- or two-family dwellings not exceeding two  
stories that do not have the horizontal or vertical structural irregularities.  
1705.13.1 Structural steel. For special inspection requirements for structural steel in seismic  
force-resisting systems, IBC Section 1705.13.1.1 references the quality assurance requirements  
of AISC 341. The first exception exempts special inspection of structural steel seismic-force-  
resisting systems that have not been specifically detailed for seismic resistance as allowed in  
Table 12.2-1 of ASCE 7. This exception does not however apply to cantilever column systems.  
The second exception does not require specific special inspections of the structural steel seismic-  
force-resisting systems in SDC D, E or F if the design and detailing is only required to comply  
with AISC 360, as specified in Table 15.4-1 of ASCE 7. This second exception only applies to  
nonbuilding structures. IBC Section 1705.13.1.2 includes similar requirements for other  
structural steel elements, such as struts, collectors, chords and foundation elements not covered  
in Section 1705.13.1.1. The exceptions are intended to mirror those of Section 1705.13.1.1.  
1705.13.2 Structural wood. The seismic special inspections required for wood structures are  
primarily to ensure continuity of load path within the seismic lateral-force-resisting system. The  
walls must transfer their inertial loads to the diaphragms, which in turn transmit the inertial loads  
through the lateral-force-resisting system to the foundation. Periodic inspection is allowed except  
in the case of field gluing operations, which are to be continuous. The section requires periodic  
special inspection for fastening such as nailing, bolting, and anchoring components of the SFRS,  
which includes chords, collectors \(struts\), braces, and hold-downs. Particular care should be  
given to the nailing of diaphragms and shear walls. Common nails are often specified in the  
design, but smaller-diameter sinkers or power-driven \(gun\) nails are often substituted in the field  
because the smaller-diameter nails have a lower lateral resistance. For example, when connecting  
two nominal 2-inch-thick \(51 mm\) members, the lateral resistance of a 0.131-inch-diameter \(3.33  
mm\) power-driven nail used as a replacement for a 10d common nail in Douglas Fir-Larch is  
only 97 pounds \(see ESR 1539\), whereas the value for the 10d common nail is 118 pounds \(see  
NDS\). Of additional importance is the connection of collectors to shear walls and the proper  
installation and tightening of hold-down bolts in shear walls. The exemption from special  
inspection applies where diaphragm and shear wall construction has a fastener spacing of more  
than 4 inches \(102 mm\) on center. The 4-inch \(102 mm\) spacing for wood construction roughly  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationtranslates to a minimum capacity of 350 plf \(5.11 kN/m\) \(ASD\) for 7/16-inch \(11.1 mm\) wood  
structural panel sheathing \(see SDPWS\). Where the fastener spacing is greater than 4 inches \(102  
mm\), there is lower demand and less potential for splitting, and special inspection is not required.  
Table 1705-4. Special Inspection for Seismic Resistance  
1705.13.3 Cold-formed steel light-frame construction. Similar to wood framing, the seismic  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationspecial inspections for cold-formed steel structures are to ensure continuity of load path within  
the seismic lateral-force-resisting system; that is, the walls must transfer their inertial loads to the  
diaphragms, which in turn transmit the inertial loads through the lateral-force-resisting system to  
the foundation. The section requires periodic special inspection of welding and fastening such as  
screw attachment, bolting, and anchoring components of the seismic-force-resisting system  
including chords, collectors \(struts\), braces, and hold-downs. Particular care should be given to  
connections of braces and hold-downs. Wood and cold-formed steel light-frame constructions  
have similar requirements for their lateral-force-resisting systems. Therefore, the exception for  
structural wood also applies, with the appropriate adaptation, to cold-formed steel light-frame  
construction. Thus, where fastener spacing for wood structural panel sheathing or steel sheets is  
greater than 4 inches \(102 mm\), there is lower demand and special inspection is not required.  
The exception for gypsum board and fiberboard shear walls is based on the fact that the capacity  
of these materials is below the demand threshold.  
1705.13.4 Designated seismic systems. As noted above, the designated seismic system consists  
of those architectural, electrical, and mechanical systems and components that require design in  
accordance with Chapter 13 of ASCE 7 for which the component importance factor, Ip, is greater  
than 1.0, as prescribed in Section 13.1.3 of ASCE 7 \(see Section 202\). Section 13.1.3 of ASCE 7  
lists four classes of components that have a component importance factor of 1.5. Refer to Section  
13.1.3 of ASCE 7 for complete descriptions of these systems. The special inspector must verify  
that elements of the designated seismic system that require certification according to Section  
1705.14.3 are properly labeled and anchored or mounted in accordance with the certificate of  
compliance. See discussion of Section 1705.14.3.  
1705.13.5 Architectural components. Exterior cladding and veneers can be a serious safety  
hazard if they become detached from the structure during seismic ground motion as well as  
potentially blocking required exit paths. The code requires periodic special inspection for  
exterior cladding, nonbearing walls and partitions, and veneer in Seismic Design Category D, E,  
or F. The exemption from special inspection applies to these elements when they are relatively  
low or lightweight. Thus, special inspection is not required when these elements are 30 feet  
\(9,144 mm\) or less above grade or the walking surface, are light-weight cladding and veneer  
weighing 5 psf \(0.24 kN/m2\) or less, or light-weight partitions weighing 15 psf \(0.72 kN/m2\) or  
less.  
1705.13.5.1 Access floors. Access floors consist of a system of panels and supports that create a  
raised floor above the actual structural floor system. The space between the raised floor and the  
structural floor contains components like wiring for power, voice, and data. The space may also  
be used for HVAC distribution either as a plenum or with ductwork. Because failure of the floor  
system can pose a threat to the occupants in high seismic areas, periodic special inspection is  
required for anchorages of access floors in structures in Seismic Design Category D, E, or F.  
1705.13.6 Plumbing, mechanical, and electrical components. Inspection is necessary for  
components that must function in post-earthquake conditions, such as emergency electrical  
systems, or for anchorage of mechanical equipment, piping, and ducting using or carrying  
flammable or hazardous materials. Periodic special inspection is required for the following items  
in structures in Seismic Design Category C, D, E, or F\: \(1\) during the anchorage of electrical  
equipment for emergency or standby power systems; \(2\) during installation of piping systems  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationintended to carry hazardous contents and their associated mechanical units; \(3\) during the  
installation of HVAC ductwork that contains hazardous materials; \(4\) during installation of  
vibration isolation systems in structures where the design requires ¼ inch \(6.35 mm\) or less  
between the equipment support frame and restraint; and \(5\) to ensure that adequate clearance is  
provided between mechanical and electrical equipment and automatic fire sprinkler systems.  
This last item was added in the 2018 IBC after experience from earthquakes has shown that  
pounding between sprinkler piping and other nonstructural components has led to connection  
failures and accidental activations. For structures in Seismic Design Category E or F, periodic  
special inspection is required for the installation of anchorage systems of all other electrical  
equipment.  
1705.13.7 Storage racks. Tall storage racks such as those typically found in large “big box”  
building supply stores can pose a threat to the public in high seismic areas \(Figure 1705-2\).  
Periodic special inspection is required for storage racks 8 feet \(2,438 mm\) or greater in height in  
Seismic Design Category D, E, or F. Design and installation of storage rack components is based  
on minimum material thicknesses, yield strengths, anchorage, etc., and compliance with these  
requirements is imperative during component fabrication and storage rack installation. Storage  
rack systems can be complex, and installation must comply with permitted drawings on file with  
the local building department.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1705-2 Steel storage racks.  
1705.13.8 Seismic isolation systems. The performance of seismic isolators is critical to the  
performance of isolation systems and energy dissipation devices. Periodic special inspection is  
required during fabrication and installation of these devices. See Section 1705.13.4, which refers  
to Section 17.8 of ASCE 7 for testing of seismic isolation systems.  
1705.13.9 Cold-formed steel special bolted moment frames. This section requires periodic  
special inspection for cold-formed steel special bolted moment frames \(CFS-SBMF\) in structures  
assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E, or F. The CFS-SBMF is a type of cold-formed steel  
moment frame SFRS designed to withstand anticipated seismic forces by dissipation of energy  
through controlled inelastic deformation. The system is listed in Table 12.2-1 of ASCE 7 \(see  
Item C.12; R = 3.5, Ωo  
= 3.0, Cd = 3.5\). Examples of items that warrant special inspection are  
critical elements of the system such as installation of the beam-to-column connections and the  
anchorage to the foundation. The North American Standard for Seismic Design of Cold-Formed  
Steel Structural Systems \(AISI S400\) contains provisions for inspections and quality control by  
the fabricator. The AISI S400 standard is used in conjunction with AISI S100, North American  
Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members.  
1705.14.1 Structural steel. Nondestructive testing of structural steel elements in seismic-force-  
resisting systems, including struts, collectors, chords, and foundation elements of buildings  
assigned to Seismic Design Category B through F is required in accordance with the quality  
assurance requirements of AISC 341. Similar to Section 1705.13.1, there are two separate  
exceptions in each subsection. The first exception for SDC B or C, exempts from nondestructive  
testing structural steel seismic force–resisting systems and elements that have not been  
specifically detailed for seismic resistance as allowed in Table 12.2-1 of ASCE 7, although this  
does not apply to cantilever column systems. The second exception does not require specific  
nondestructive testing of the steel systems or elements in seismic force–resisting systems in SDC  
D, E, or F if the design and detailing is only required to comply with AISC 360, as specified in  
Table 15.4-1 of ASCE 7. This second exception only applies to nonbuilding structures.  
1705.14.2 Nonstructural components. For structures assigned to Seismic Design Category B  
through F, nonstructural components, supports, and attachments must meet the seismic  
qualification requirements of Item 2 of Section 13.2.1 of ASCE 7. Item 2 requires submittal of  
the manufacturer’s certification that the component is qualified by at least one of the following\:  
\(a\) analysis, \(b\) testing in accordance with the alternative found in Section 13.2.5, or \(c\)  
experience data in accordance with the alternative prescribed in Section 13.2.6. The registered  
design professional is required to indicate on the construction documents the requirements for  
seismic qualification and certificates of compliance documenting that qualification requirements  
are met and must be submitted to the building official as required by Section 1704.5.  
1705.14.3 Designated seismic systems. Structures assigned to Seismic Design Categories C  
through F with designated seismic systems that are subject to the requirements of Section 13.2.2  
of ASCE 7 require certification as follows\: \(1\) Active mechanical and electrical equipment that  
must remain operable following the design earthquake ground motion is to be certified by the  
manufacturer as operable. Active parts or energized components must be certified on the basis of  
approved shake table testing in accordance with Section 13.2.5 or experience data in accordance  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwith Section 13.2.6 unless it can be shown that the component is “inherently rugged” by  
comparison with similar seismically qualified components. \(2\) Components assigned a  
component importance factor of 1.5 with hazardous substances must be certified by the  
manufacturer that they maintain containment following the design earthquake ground motion by  
\(a\) analysis, \(b\) approved shake table testing in accordance with Section 13.2.5 \(see example in  
Figure 1705-3\), or \(c\) experience data in accordance with Section 13.2.6. As noted above for the  
SFRS, the registered design professional is required to indicate on the construction documents  
the requirements for seismic qualification and certificates of compliance documenting that the  
qualification requirements are met and must be submitted to the building official as specified in  
Section 1704.5.

formed steel diaphragms.  
1705.14.4 Seismic isolation systems. Seismic isolation systems in seismically isolated structures  
assigned to Seismic Design Category B through F must be tested in accordance with Section 17.8  
of ASCE 7. ASCE 7 Section 17.8 requires the deformation characteristics and damping values of  
the isolation system used in the design and analysis be based on tests of a selected sample of the  
components prior to construction. The isolation system components to be tested are required to  
include wind-restraint systems where these systems are used in the design.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1705.15 Sprayed fire-resistant materials. This section provides requirements for special  
inspection of spray applied fire-resistant materials \(SFRM\) for floor, roof, and wall assemblies,  
and structural members. For an SFRM to perform as intended, its application must be within the  
proper range for certain parameters as determined by the system manufacturer. Requirements are  
provided for physical and visual testing to demonstrate compliance with the required fire-  
resistance rating and applicable listing, with specific requirements given for structural member  
surface conditions, proper application, thickness, density, and bond strength. These parameters  
must be checked prior to and during installation of the SFRM.  
1705.16 Mastic and intumescent fire-resistant coatings. Where fire-resistant coatings are used  
on structural members and decks, the special inspector must verify that they are applied in  
accordance with the Association of the Wall and Ceiling Industry Technical Manual 12-B  
\(AWCI 12-B\), Standard Practice for the Testing and Inspection of Field Applied Thin Film  
Intumescent Fire-Resistive Materials, based on the required fire resistance as shown in the  
approved construction documents.  
1705.17 Exterior insulation and finish systems \(EIFS\). Special inspection is required for EIFS  
based on the approved research report and manufacturer’s installation instructions. Critical areas  
necessary for adequate EIFS performance are proper installation of the waterproofing membrane  
and installation of flashings at windows, doors, joints, eaves, corners, and penetrations. The  
Association of the Wall and Ceiling Industry \(AWCI\) offers training and certification programs  
for performing proper special inspection of EIFS. The exceptions from requiring special  
inspection are for EIFS installed over a water-resistive barrier, or concrete or masonry walls.  
1705.17.1 Water-resistant barrier coating. Where a water-resistive barrier coating is applied  
between the EIFS and the sheathing, special inspection is required for the barrier coating. The  
coating must be properly applied to provide additional protection to the building from incidental  
moisture intrusion that may occur through the building envelope.  
1705.18 Fire-resistant penetrations and joints. This section requires special inspection of fire-  
resistant penetrations and joints in high-rise buildings, buildings in Risk Category III or IV, or  
fire areas containing Group R occupancies with an occupant load greater than 250. Through-  
penetration and membrane-penetration firestop systems, as well as fire-resistant joint systems  
and perimeter fire barrier systems, are critical to maintaining the fire-resistive integrity of fire-  
resistance-rated construction elements, including fire walls, fire barriers, fire partitions, smoke  
barriers, and horizontal assemblies. The proper selection and installation of such systems must be  
in compliance with the code and/or appropriate listing. Where these systems are used in  
categories of buildings considered “high risk,  
” they must be included in the special inspection  
program.  
Although the proper application of firestop and joint system requirements is very important in  
all types and sizes of buildings, the requirement for special inspection is limited to specific  
building types that represent a substantial hazard to human life in the event of a system failure or  
that are considered to be essential facilities. Inspection conforming to ASTM E2174 for  
penetration firestop systems and ASTM E2393 for fire-resistant joint systems increases the level  
of quality assurance.  
1705.18.1 Penetration firestops. A primary method of addressing a penetration of a fire-  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationresistance-rated wall assembly is through the use of an approved firestop system installed in  
accordance with ASTM E814 or UL 1479. The system must have an F rating that is not less than  
the fire-resistance rating of the wall being penetrated. It is critical that the firestop system be  
appropriate for the penetration being protected. The choice of firestop systems varies based on  
the size and material of the penetrating item, as well as the construction materials and fire-  
resistance rating of the wall being penetrated. Special inspection of the firestop system is  
intended to verify that the appropriate system has been specified and the installation is in  
conformance with its listing.  
1705.18.2 Fire-resistant joint systems. A joint is defined as a “linear opening in or between  
adjacent fire-resistance-rated assemblies that is designed to allow independent movement of the  
building in any plane caused by thermal, seismic, wind or any other loading.  
” The joint creates  
an interruption of the fire-resistant integrity of the wall or floor system, requiring the use of an  
appropriate fire-resistant joint system. The code mandates general installation criteria for such  
systems and requires them to be tested in accordance with ASTM E1966 or UL 2079. Much like  
the inspection of penetration firestop systems, the proper choice and installation of fire-resistant  
joint systems can be verified through a comprehensive special inspection process. Although  
regulated under the provisions for fire-resistant joint systems, a second type of system is  
technically not a joint, but rather an extension of protection afforded by a horizontal assembly.  
The void created at the intersection of an exterior curtain wall assembly and a fire-resistance-  
rated floor or floor-ceiling assembly must be filled in a manner that maintains the integrity of the  
horizontal assembly. The system utilized to fill the void must be in compliance with ASTM  
E2307 and able to resist the passage of flame for a time period equal to that of the floor  
assembly. Special inspection is necessary to ensure that the appropriate joint system is chosen  
and properly installed.  
1705.19 Testing for smoke control. This section, although related to mechanical systems rather  
than structural or architectural systems, is required by the code because the mechanical ductwork  
and signaling devices are likely to be concealed during the building construction, and the  
ductwork needs to be leakage tested prior to concealment.  
1705.19.1 Testing scope. The special inspection applies to leakage testing of the ductwork prior  
to concealment and overall system performance of the completed system prior to occupancy.  
1705.19.2 Qualifications. The special inspection agencies that perform the testing are required  
to have specific expertise in fire protection or mechanical engineering and air balancing. The  
Associated Air Balance Council \(AABC\) is the certifying association for air balance testing.  
AABC has certifications for technicians and equipment commissioning.  
1705.20 Sealing of Mass Timber. Periodic special inspections of sealants or adhesives are  
required where sealant or adhesive required by IBC 703.7 is applied to mass timber building  
elements as designated in the approved construction documents.  
Some mass timber panels are manufactured under proprietary processes to ensure there are no  
voids at abutting edges and intersections. Where this proprietary process is incorporated and  
tested, there is no requirement for sealant or adhesive and an exception is provided for this  
instance. Where sealant is not required and is not specifically excluded it is still considered good  
practice covered by this section.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSpecial inspection of mass timber sealing requirements does not apply to “joints” as defined  
in IBC 202 since joints have their own requirements for the placement and inspection of fire-  
resistant joint systems in IBC Section 1705.18. Joints are defined as having an opening that is  
designed to accommodate building tolerances or to allow independent movement. Panels and  
members that are connected do not meet the definition of a joint since they are rigidly connected  
and do not have an opening.  
No provisions address fabrication of mass timber structural elements. Mass timber structural  
elements manufactured in a fabricator shop are addressed by IBC 1704.2.5 and 1704.2.5.1  
regarding fabrication.  
Section 1706 Design Strengths of Materials  
This section requires the strength of structural materials to conform to the applicable design  
standards, or in the absence of such standards, must conform to accepted engineering practice.  
1706.2 New materials. Materials not explicitly covered by the code are allowed, subject to  
testing that demonstrates adequate performance. Section 1707 provides alternative test  
procedures, and Section 104.11 provides administrative means of accepting alternative methods  
of design and construction.  
Section 1707 Alternate Test Procedures  
Test reports from approved agencies may be used as the basis for approval of materials not  
specifically covered by the code or approved standards. New materials not covered in the code  
are also mentioned in Section 1701.2. This section references Section 104.11 in regard to the use  
of new, innovative, or alternative materials. The building official has the authority to accept such  
materials based on reports from an approved agency that is independent from the material  
supplier. ICC Evaluation Service Reports are the most straightforward method used by building  
officials to review products and systems that are not specifically covered by the code. The cost  
associated with performing testing and issuing research reports is to be borne by the applicant  
which is the owner or the owner’s agent.  
Section 1708 In Situ Load Tests  
This section covers structural analysis or load testing for existing structures or portions thereof  
where the load-bearing capacity or stability is in doubt.  
1708.1 General. When there is doubt as to the structural integrity, load-carrying capacity, or  
stability of an existing structure or portion thereof, the building official has the option of  
requiring a structural analysis or a load test, or both. If an engineering analysis is required, it  
should be based on the as-built conditions and actual material properties. If the structural  
analysis shows that the structure is not capable of safely carrying the code-design loads, the  
structure must be load tested. If the structure is found to be inadequate or unstable, the structural  
system must be modified to provide adequate structural integrity.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1708.2 In situ load tests. In situ tests fall into two categories\: procedures specified and  
procedures not specified. Load testing must simulate the loading required by Chapter 16 and be  
performed under the supervision of the registered design professional.  
1708.2.1 Load test procedure specified. When the applicable standard has a test procedure and  
acceptance criteria specified, the requirements of the standard should be applied.  
1708.2.2 Load test procedures not specified. When there is no applicable load test procedure in  
a referenced standard, the structure or portion thereof should be tested with a loading protocol  
that simulates the actual loads and deformations, both lateral and vertical, that the structure is  
expected to receive. For the gravity system, the vertical loads should be equal to the factored  
design loads. Dead loads should include expected partition loads.  
This section clarifies static load test requirements and specifies how to test components that  
carry dynamic loads. The code language also considers differences influenced by load duration  
effects when testing wood elements.  
Section 1709 Preconstruction Load Tests  
This section applies to materials or methods of construction that are not capable of being  
designed by conventional engineering analysis or do not comply with referenced standards.  
1709.1 General. When the load-carrying capacity and the physical properties of materials or  
methods of construction are not amenable to analysis by accepted engineering methods, or the  
material or method does not comply with applicable standards, the structural load capacity and  
physical properties must be determined by tests specified in this section. Where tests meet the  
requirements of the code and approved procedures, the building official is required to accept  
certified reports of tests conducted by an approved testing agency. This section is applicable to  
components, assemblies, and elements of structures, for example, windows. This section is not  
applicable to load testing of existing structures \(see discussion of Section 1708\).  
1709.2 Load test procedures specified. When an applicable standard has a test procedure and  
acceptance criteria, the standard should be applied.  
1709.3 Load test procedures not specified. When there is no applicable load test procedure in a  
referenced standard, the structure or portion thereof should be tested with a loading protocol that  
simulates the applicable loading conditions and deformations, both lateral and vertical, that the  
structure is expected to sustain. For components, assemblies, and elements that are not part of the  
SFRS, the loading and acceptance criteria are set forth in Section 1709.3.1.  
1709.3.1 Test procedure. The loading procedure and acceptance criteria use commonly  
accepted engineering practices to test the adequacy of the component or assembly to resist  
structural failure at the design loads. The test load is 2 times the design load for 24 hours, and  
must recover at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection within 24 hours after the test. The  
test assembly is then reloaded until failure occurs or 2½ times the load corresponding to the  
maximum allowable deflection is reached \(see Section 1604.3\) or 2½ times the design load is  
reached. This procedure should be used only for loads for which the upper bounds can be  
established with a reasonable degree of accuracy such as dead and live loads. This procedure  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationshould not be used for earthquake loads and should be used with care for wind loads.  
1709.3.2 Deflection. Deflection under design load is limited to the allowable limits set forth in  
Section 1604.3.  
1709.4 Wall and partition assemblies. Walls and partitions must be tested for simultaneous  
vertical and lateral loads, both with and without door and window framing.  
1709.5 Exterior window and door assemblies. Door and window assemblies are generally  
qualified by tests specified in Section 1709.5.1, which requires testing and labeling in accordance  
with the American Architectural Manufacturers Association/Window and Door Manufacturers  
Association/Canadian Standards Association \(AAMA/WDMA/CSA\) standard, or testing in  
accordance with Section 1709.5.2 and the referenced ASTM and Door & Access Systems  
Manufacturers Association \(DASMA\) standards. The exception permits allowable wind  
pressures for differently-sized units made of identical components, including glass thickness, to  
have different design values than the tested assembly as determined by engineering analysis or  
an additional test, provided that the additional test is done on the assembly with the alternative  
allowable design pressure. Where engineering analysis is used, an AAMA analysis procedure is  
required.  
1709.5.1 Exterior windows and doors. Exterior windows and sliding doors must be tested and  
labeled as conforming to the AAMA/WDMA/CSA101/I.S.2/A440 standard. Side-hinged exterior  
doors can comply with the standard or meet the requirements of Section 1709.5.2, as discussed  
below. The products tested and labeled in accordance with the AAMA/WDMA/CSA standard  
need not comply with the analysis and testing requirements of Section 2403.2 and the deflection  
limitations specified in Section 2403.3.  
1709.5.2 Exterior windows and door assemblies not provided for in Section 1709.5.1.  
Exterior window and door assemblies not covered by Section 1709.5.1 must be tested in  
accordance with ASTM E330. The test load is equal to 1.5 times the design pressure, as  
determined per Chapter 16, applied for 10 seconds. Exterior window and door assemblies  
covered by this section and containing glass are required to conform to the requirements of  
Section 2403.  
1709.5.2.1 Garage doors and rolling doors. Requirements for structural performance of garage  
doors are found in ASTM E330 and ANSI/DASMA 108 for sectional garage doors and rolling  
doors. This section further requires that garage doors have a permanent label that provides a way  
for building owners, homeowners, and others to be able to determine their performance  
characteristics after the building has been occupied.  
1709.5.3 Windborne debris protection. In windborne debris regions, glazing in buildings shall  
be impact resistant or protected with an impact-resistant covering meeting the requirements of an  
approved impact-resistant standard.  
1709.5.3.1 Impact protective systems testing and labeling. Impact protective systems in  
windborne debris regions require testing by an approved independent laboratory per ASTM  
E1886 and ASTM E1996 and design wind pressure per ASTM E330. This section further  
requires that impact protective systems have a permanent label that provides a way for building  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationowners, homeowners, and others to be able to determine their performance characteristics after  
the building has been occupied.  
1709.6 Skylights and sloped glass. A tubular daylighting device \(TDD\) is typically field-  
assembled from a manufactured kit, unlike a unit skylight, which is typically shipped as a  
factory-assembled unit. The dome of a TDD is not necessarily constructed out of a single panel  
of glazing material. Thus, a separate definition of a TDD is included in Chapter 2 based on the  
definition in AAMA/WDMA A440, and TDD’s are included in Section 2405.5. The section  
refers to Chapter 24 for sloped unit skylight and TDD requirements.  
1709.7 Test specimens. Test specimens should be representative of what is actually used in  
practice. Tests must be conducted or witnessed by an independent approved agency.  
Example 17-1 Sample Statement of Special Inspections  
The following “Statement of Special Inspections” \(SSI\) should address the special inspection  
and structural testing items required by IBC Chapter 17 Per IBC 1704.3 the SSI should list all

Key Points  
Satisfactory performance of the building structural system is critical in the overall  
performance of any building during its life cycle. The IBC® structural provisions in Chapters  
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 work together to provide for the overall performance and  
safety of the structural system. Section 1604.4, Analysis, requires that all structural systems  
have a continuous load path from the point of origin to the resisting element. The resisting  
element for buildings and other structures is the foundation that ultimately transfers the loads  
to the supporting soil. Therefore, the satisfactory performance of the foundation system is  
critical to the satisfactory performance of the overall structure. Most building structures are  
designed assuming a fixed unyielding base that is not subjected to large total or differential  
settlements or displacements. Shallow foundations on firm soils will generally perform  
satisfactorily if the requirements of these provisions are followed.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFoundation design, however, becomes a significant factor for large structures, embedded  
structures such as a tall building constructed over a multilevel basement garage, structures on  
soft soils, structures supporting rotating or reciprocating equipment, and structures sensitive to  
differential displacements. It is important to have a good knowledge of the behavior of the  
various foundation types, including their limitations. In addition, for structures subject to high-  
wind forces or seismic ground motion, special consideration must be given to the lateral load  
path, and, in the case of deep foundation-supported structures, the ability of the deep  
foundation to survive the displacements and curvatures imposed on the pile by seismic ground  
motion.  
Sufficient understanding of the behavior and limitations of the various deep and shallow  
foundation systems is necessary to determine that the foundation and its supported structure  
will provide the intended serviceability. It is important to determine whether the estimated  
total and differential foundation settlements are compatible with the selected structure type.  
For example, a stiff bearing-wall structure with openings may be more sensitive to differential  
settlements than a more flexible light-frame structure. When considering seismic ground  
motion, sufficient knowledge of ground-shaking effects on the foundation is important,  
particularly in soft soils  
Section 1801 General  
1801.1 Scope. The requirements of this chapter apply to all building and foundation systems of  
any type and any location. For example, buildings located in beach-front properties that would be  
subject to wave run up and inundation during hurricanes can still be designed using applicable  
loads from ASCE 7 Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other  
Structures and ASCE 24 Flood Resistant Design and Construction with proper geotechnical  
investigation and engineering analysis. ASCE 7 Chapter 5 and ASCE 24 are referenced in  
Section 1612.2 for the design and construction of buildings and structures in flood hazard areas,  
including coastal high-hazard areas and coastal A zones.  
Section 1802 Design Basis  
Bearing pressures, stresses, and lateral pressures used in this chapter are allowable pressures or  
stresses, not strength level values. These allowable foundation pressures are to be used with the  
allowable stress design load combinations set forth in Section 2.4 of ASCE 7 unless noted  
otherwise. Material requirements are outlined in Chapters 19, 21, 22, and 23. Site excavations  
and grading are covered in Section 1804.  
Section 1803 Geotechnical Investigations  
1803.1 General. A geotechnical investigation must be conducted when required by the building  
official. In general, the investigation should be required unless the foundation is designed and  
constructed in accordance with the presumptive allowable foundation pressures and lateral-  
bearing pressures set forth in Section 1806. Some minimal knowledge of soil classification at the  
bearing elevation of the foundation is required by Section 1806. A registered design professional  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationshould be used as required by the professional practice laws of the state in which the jurisdiction  
is located. The practice of geotechnical or soils engineering is a branch of civil engineering and  
is generally regulated by the various states.  
1803.2 Investigation required. A foundation and soils investigation is required for any of the  
adverse subsurface conditions listed in Sections 1803.5.2 through 1803.5.12.  
In certain cases, an exception allows the building official some flexibility in requiring a  
foundation and soils investigation when the soil conditions of the site are already known from  
other soils reports. For example, if the site is located in an area where there are reasonably  
uniform and horizontal soil strata and a soils report is available for the adjacent parcels, then a  
new soils report should not be necessary. This exception does not apply to some very specific  
conditions such as analysis of lateral pressure, liquefaction potential, and ground stabilization  
techniques in Seismic Design Categories \(SDCs\) D, E, and F. Other conditions where the  
exception does not apply and a geotechnical investigation is mandated are excavation near  
existing foundations, compacted fill materials, and controlled low-strength materials \(CLSMs\).  
1803.3 Basis of investigation. The investigation cannot be solely based on theoretical analysis  
and research; rather, analysis and observation through tests of materials by borings, test pits, or  
other subsurface explorations in appropriate locations is needed. The number and types of tests,  
equipment used, type of site inspections, and other issues relevant to the scope of the  
investigation are the responsibility of and must be under the supervision of a registered design  
professional experienced in soils exploration. Some states and local municipalities have set  
criteria on the minimum number of investigations required. Additional studies shall also be made  
as necessary for conditions such as slope stability, soil strength, position and adequacy of load-  
bearing soils, the effect of moisture variation on soil-bearing capacity, compressibility,  
liquefaction, and expansiveness.  
1803.4 Qualified representative. Whenever the allowable bearing capacity is in doubt or a  
geotechnical investigation is necessary, exploratory borings are necessary to determine the soil  
characteristics and the load-bearing capacity. The investigation procedures must be outlined and  
identified by the registered design professional in accordance with the accepted engineering  
practice and acceptable standards. The apparatus and equipment used in the investigation must  
be calibrated and perform as expected for accurate results. Special inspection requirements for  
soil-related activities are provided in Chapter 17 of the IBC. Qualified representatives must be  
present on site during the boring or sampling operations. Qualifications of investigative or  
inspection agencies and individuals are typically established by their experience, certification,  
and accreditation through an approved accreditation body such as the International Accreditation  
Service \(IAS\).  
1803.5 Investigated conditions. Those cases where geotechnical investigations are required  
have been provided in Sections 1803.5.2 through 1803.5.12. It should be emphasized that the  
exception discussed in Section 1803.2 that allows the building official to waive the investigation  
can be used in most of these conditions except those that are critical or are site specific and  
cannot be determined based on existing geotechnical investigations of surrounding areas \(lateral  
pressure, liquefaction potential, and ground stabilization techniques in SDCs D, E, and F,  
excavation near foundations, compacted fill materials, and CLSMs\). Soil materials are required  
to be classified in accordance with the Unified Soil Classification System found in ASTM D2487  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation\(Practice for Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes\) \(Unified Soil Classification  
System\). IBC Table 1610.1 provides the Unified Soil Classification for some backfill materials.  
This table establishes the minimum soil lateral loads for the design of foundation walls and  
retaining walls.  
1803.5.2 Questionable soil. Where the classification, strength, or compressibility is uncertain, or  
where bearing capacity of soil in excess of the presumptive value is claimed, the code allows the  
building official to obtain a geotechnical report. In this section, two cases trigger a foundation  
soils investigation and report\:  
1\. Where the design load-bearing value is greater than the presumptive allowable  
foundation pressures and lateral-bearing pressures set forth in Section 1806.  
2\. Where the type of soil, the bearing capacity, or the stiffness of the soil is questionable,  
such as in areas subject to liquefaction from strong ground shaking, in areas containing  
soft or sensitive clays such as bay muds, or in areas with unconsolidated or improperly  
consolidated fills.  
1803.5.3 Expansive soil. Expansive soils are those that shrink and swell appreciably because of  
changes in soil moisture content. Reference should be made to Section 1808.6 for mitigation  
methods and design for expansive soils. Frost heave is not considered in this section. Expansive  
soils are present or prevalent in all 50 states of the United States and in many other countries  
around the globe. Soils must meet all four of the criteria to be classified as expansive, not just a  
high Plasticity or Expansion Index.  
The section allows two different ways to identify expansive soils. The first option involves  
meeting four criteria\: \(1\) Plasticity Index \(PI\) of 15 or greater determined by ASTM D4318; \(2\)  
more than 10 percent of the soil particles pass a No. 200 sieve determined by ASTM D422; \(3\)  
more than 10 percent of the soil particles are less than 5 micrometers in size as determined by  
ASTM D422; and \(4\) an Expansion Index greater than 20 according to ASTM D4829. The  
second option is to determine if the Expansion Index \(according to ASTM D4829\) is greater than  
20\. If the Expansion Index is determined, the first three tests need not be conducted. In other  
words, Expansion Index \> 20 is both a necessary and sufficient condition by itself.  
1803.5.4 Ground-water table. This section may cause significant changes to the conventional  
approach to foundation design and construction for light-frame buildings with subsurface floors,  
either a basement or a hillside building with a floor cut into the hillside. A foundation and soils  
investigation is required to show that the ground-water table is at least 5 feet \(1,524 mm\) below  
the elevation of the lowest floor level unless waterproofing is provided in accordance with  
Section 1805.  
1803.5.5 Deep foundations. Section 1803.6 lists the general items that must be included in a  
geotechnical report. This includes items such as a plot of the locations of soil investigations, soil  
profiles, the elevation of the water table, and shallow foundation recommendations. When deep  
foundations are required on a project, the geotechnical report should also list the specific items  
noted in Section 1803.5.5. This includes the recommended types of deep foundations and their  
capacities and suitability for the environment, the maximum center-to-center spacing, the driving  
criteria, installation procedures, special inspection and reporting requirements, load test  
requirements, the required bearing level of foundation elements, and reductions for group  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationactions.  
The initial geotechnical recommendations for a project typically consider shallow  
foundations, but after reviewing the recommendations the design team or owner may decide to  
switch to a deep foundation system. It could be that a significant amount of over-excavation and  
replacement of structural fill is required prior to installation of shallow foundations. After pricing  
this option, deep foundations become more feasible. Regardless of when the decision to use deep  
foundations occurs, it is important to obtain the specific recommendations for the deep  
foundations from the geotechnical engineer as outlined in Section 1803.5.5.  
Two items worth highlighting in this section are the types of deep foundations and the load  
test requirements. There are many types of deep foundation elements and not all are ideal for  
each site. As an example, helical piers would not be ideal in areas where a significant amount of  
cobbles exist in the subsurface soils. Likewise, some cast-in-place \(CIP\) systems would not be  
ideal where caving soils exist. Many deep foundations require test piles or piers to be installed  
and load tests to be conducted prior to installing the systems throughout the site. Load test  
criteria are discussed in detail in Section 1810.3.3 but this information should be specified by the  
geotechnical engineer as specified in Section 1803.5.5.  
1803.5.6 Rock strata. If a rock stratum is being used for bearing, the characteristics of the layer  
must be known in sufficient detail to classify the rock per Section 1803.5.1.  
1803.5.7 Excavation near foundations. The intent of this section is clear in that lateral and  
subjacent support of any foundation must not be removed unless an investigation is conducted to  
identify the potential problems that might be created and how to provide the needed lateral  
support. For example, the area shown in Figure 1803-1 should not be excavated without  
conducting an investigation to address support for the foundation.  
Figure 1803-1 Lateral support.  
1803.5.8 Compacted fill material. When compacted fill of more than 12 inches \(305 mm\) in  
depth is used for shallow foundation support, the geotechnical investigation required in Section  
1803 must also contain the seven items listed in this section.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1803.5.9 Controlled low-strength material \(CLSM\). CLSM is a self-compacted, cementitious  
material used as backfill instead of compacted backfill. It has also been referred to as “flowable  
fill” and “lean mix backfill.  
” CLSM has a compressive strength of 1200 psi \(8,274 kPa\) or less.  
Most CLSM applications require unconfined compressive strengths of 200 psi \(1,379 kPa\) or  
less to allow for future excavation of CLSM. CLSM is composed of water, portland cement,  
aggregate, and fly ash. It is a fluid material with typical slumps of 10 inches \(254 mm\) or more  
and has a consistency similar to a milk shake.  
1803.5.10 Alternate setback and clearance. This alternate procedure allows the building  
official to approve alternate setbacks and clearances from slopes, provided that the intent of  
Section 1808.7 is met. This section gives the building official the authority to require a  
geotechnical investigation by a qualified geotechnical engineer to establish that the intent of  
Section 1808.7 is met and specifies the minimum parameters to be investigated.  
1803.5.11 Seismic design categories C through F. For all structures in SDCs C through F, a  
geotechnical investigation is required to evaluate liquefaction, slope stability, total and  
differential settlement, and surface displacement caused by faulting or lateral spreading.  
Significant ground motion can occur even in areas with moderate seismic risk. Liquefaction  
typically occurs at sites with loose sands and high water tables. Surface rupture generally occurs  
with large-magnitude earthquake events. Lateral spreading often happens adjacent to waterways  
where a saturated soil has a free edge.  
1803.5.12 Seismic design categories D through F. In addition to the investigation required for  
SDCs C through F by Section 1803.5.11, the investigation must evaluate the additional lateral  
pressures on basement or retaining walls from ground shaking, the detrimental effects and  
consequences of liquefaction or soil strength loss, and mitigation measures. The potential for  
liquefaction and soil strength loss must be evaluated using the peak acceleration based on a site-  
specific study and including the effects of soil amplification.  
Liquefaction causes loss of bearing capacity with resulting large differential or total  
settlements. Structures with high height-to-width ratios that have liquefaction occur under a  
portion of the structure are subject to overturning.  
Mitigation measures for liquefaction include\:  
1\. In situ densification of the loose sands subject to liquefaction.  
2\. Use of pile foundations penetrating through the liquefying layers. The pile capacity  
must be developed through bearing or skin friction in the soils below the liquefying  
layers.  
3\. Use of rigid raft foundations that can minimize the effects of settlement caused by loss  
of bearing capacity.  
Soil strength loss is associated with “sensitive” or “quick” clays that are sensitive to  
remolding effects. These soft clays typically occur in marine \(or former marine\) environments  
and are often called “bay muds.  
” The clays lose significant strength when remolded. Remolding  
and subsequent strength loss occurs when a pile foundation through these clays is subjected to  
strong ground shaking. As a consequence, lateral support for the pile is lost.  
Mitigation measures for soils susceptible to strength loss such as “sensitive” or “quick” clays  
include\:  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1\. 2. 3. Replacement of the soft clay.  
In situ consolidation of the soft clays by preloading or water removal.  
Use of pile foundations penetrating through the soft clay layers. The pile capacity must  
be developed through bearing or skin friction in the soils below the soft clay layers.  
Foundation or retaining walls that support 6-feet \(1,829 mm\) of backfill must consider  
seismic earth pressure. Shorter walls are not required to consider this additional earth pressure  
load in the wall design. If such walls exist on a project the site-specific geotechnical report must  
list the seismic earth pressures that should be considered in the design. These pressures can  
significantly alter the required design of the walls in question. Other design pressures that need  
to be considered include static earth pressures, surcharge loads, hydrostatic loads, sloped  
backfill, and more.  
1803.6 Reporting. The objective of a geotechnical investigation is to produce all the necessary  
information for design and construction of a structure’s foundation. To ensure that the report of  
the foundation and soils investigation meets this objective and provides enough data to ensure  
compliance with the code and a safe foundation, the report must contain at a minimum the items  
enumerated in this section. See also report requirements for deep foundations in Section  
1803.5.5, compacted fill in Section 1803.5.8, and for CLSM in Section 1803.5.9. Other data such  
as results of consolidation tests, compaction curves, sieve analyses, Atterberg Limits tests, and  
Plasticity and Expansion Index tests should be included in the report where available.  
Section 1804 Excavation, Grading, and Fill  
1804.1 Excavations near foundations. Excavations should not reduce the lateral support  
provided by any foundation without first protecting the foundation against detrimental  
movements. See discussion under Section 1803.5.7.  
1804.2 Underpinning. This section requires that underpinning activities comply with both  
Chapter 18 and Chapter 33 on safeguards during construction. Excavations within existing  
buildings, or near adjacent buildings, can cause significant damage. This section makes it clear  
that should any excavations be performed near existing foundations specific protocols will need  
to be followed. It also indicates that the plans should note the “sequence” at which such  
excavations will occur.  
1804.3 Placement of backfill. Backfill should be performed in accordance with an approved  
soils report. If no soils report is needed, the backfill should be placed in maximum 6-inch \(152-  
mm\) layers free from any rocks or cobbles larger than 4 inches and compacted to a minimum 90-  
percent relative density \(Modified Proctor per ASTM D1557\) using the appropriate compaction  
equipment. CLSM is an acceptable backfill material that needs not be compacted. See further  
discussion under Section 1803.5.9.  
1804.4 Site grading. The general requirement is that surface water must drain away from  
foundations. Minimum slope is 5 percent for a distance of 10 feet \(3,048 mm\). An alternate  
method is permitted if physical obstructions or lot lines prohibit the 5-percent slope for a  
minimum of 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) horizontally. In this case, swales or impervious surfaces must  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationhave a minimum 2-percent slope where located within 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) of the building  
foundation. An exception is provided that allows impervious surfaces to be sloped less than 2  
percent where the surface serves a door landing or ramp required for egress purposes in  
accordance with Section 1010.1.4, 1012.3, or 1012.6.1.  
1804.5 Grading and fill in flood hazard areas. In general, grading is not permitted in  
designated flood hazard areas. Changes in the configuration or shape of floodways by grading or  
fill can divert erosive flows and increase wave energies that could increase forces and adversely  
affect adjacent buildings and structures. The restrictions in the code are consistent with  
provisions related to fill in ASCE 24, Flood Resistant Design and Construction. The exceptions  
permit grading in flood hazard areas, provided an engineering analysis demonstrates that the  
proposed grading will not increase flood levels or otherwise adversely affect the design flow.  
The last exception allows grading in flood hazard areas that are not designated floodways,  
provided the overall effect of the encroachment does not increase the design flood elevation by  
more than 1 foot \(305 mm\) at any point.  
1804.6 Compacted fill material. See discussion under Section 1803.5.8 for geotechnical report  
requirements. The exception to the geotechnical report requires compacted fill to be no more  
than 12 inches \(305 mm\) deep, have specific density requirements, and undergo special  
inspection in accordance with Section 1705.6.  
1804.7 Controlled low-strength material \(CLSM\). See discussion under Section 1803.5.9.  
Section 1805 Dampproofing and Waterproofing  
This section covers the requirements for waterproofing and dampproofing those parts of  
substructure construction that need to be provided with moisture protection. Sections 1805.1  
through 1805.3 identify the locations where moisture barriers are required and specify the  
materials to be used and the methods of application. The provisions also deal with subsurface  
water conditions, drainage systems, and other protection requirements.  
Dampproofing requirements are outlined in Section 1805.2, and waterproofing requirements  
are covered in Section 1805.3. Although both terms are intended to apply to the installation and  
the use of moisture barriers, dampproofing does not furnish the same degree of moisture  
protection as does waterproofing.  
Dampproofing generally refers to the application of one or more coatings of a compound or  
other materials that are impervious to water, which are used to prevent the passage of water  
vapor through walls or other building components, and which restrict the flow of water under  
slight hydrostatic pressure. Waterproofing, on the other hand, refers to the application of coatings  
and sealing materials to walls or other building components to prevent moisture from penetrating  
in either a vapor or liquid form, even under conditions of significant hydrostatic pressure.  
Hydrostatic pressure is created by the presence of water under pressure. This pressure can occur  
when the ground-water table rises above the bottom of the foundation wall, or the soil next to the  
foundation wall becomes saturated with water caused by uncontrolled storm water runoff.  
1805.1 General. This section is an overall requirement specifying that waterproofing and damp -  
proofing applications are to be made to horizontal and vertical surfaces of those below-ground  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationspaces where the occupancy would normally be adversely affected by the intrusion of water or  
moisture. Moisture or water in a floor below grade can cause damage to structural members such  
as columns, posts, or load-bearing walls, as well as pose a health hazard by promoting growth of  
bacteria or fungi. Moisture can adversely affect any mechanical and electrical appliances that  
may be located at that level. It can also cause a great deal of damage to goods that may be  
located or stored in that lower level. These vertical and horizontal surfaces include foundation  
walls, retaining walls, underfloor spaces, and floor slabs. Waterproofing and dampproofing are  
not required in locations other than residential and institutional occupancies where the omission  
of moisture barriers would not adversely affect the use of the spaces. An example of a location  
where waterproofing or dampproofing would not be required is in an open parking structure,  
provided the structural components are individually protected against the effects of water.  
Waterproofing and dampproofing are not permitted to be omitted from residential and  
institutional occupancies where people may be sleeping or services are provided on the floor  
below grade. A person waking in a flooded basement may find themselves in a very hazardous  
situation particularly if the possibility exists of an electrical charge in the water caused by  
electrical service at that level.  
Section 1805.1.1 addresses the type of problem faced when a portion of a story is above  
grade, whereas Section 1805.1.2 limits any infiltration of water into crawl spaces so as to protect  
this area from potential water damage and prevent ponding of water in the crawl space. These  
sections reference other applicable sections of Chapter 18. Section 1805.1.3 deals with ground-  
water control systems.  
1805.1.1 Story above grade plane. The provisions of this section require that where a basement  
is deemed to be a story above grade plane, the section of the basement floor that occurs below  
the exterior ground level and the walls that bound that part of the floor are to be dampproofed in  
accordance with the requirements of Section 1805.2.  
The use of dampproofing, rather than waterproofing, is permitted here because high  
hydrostatic pressure will not tend to develop against the walls if the basement is a story above  
grade plane and the ground level adjacent to the basement wall is below the basement floor  
elevation for not less than 25 percent of the basement perimeter.  
Any water pressure that may occur against the walls below ground or under the basement  
floor would be relieved by the water drainage system required in this section. The drainage  
system would be installed at the base of the wall construction in accordance with Section  
1805.4.2 for a minimum distance along those portions of the wall perimeter where the basement  
floor is below ground level.  
Because of the relationship of grade to the basement floor and the inclusion of foundation  
drains, the potential for hydrostatic pressure buildup is not significant. Therefore, a ground-water  
table investigation, waterproofing, and a basement floor gravel base course are not required.  
The objective of this section is to prevent moisture migration in basement spaces. In story-  
above-grade plane construction that meets the requirements of this section, the basement floor  
would be only partly below ground level \(sometimes a small part\) and the need for section-  
required moisture protection is unnecessary. Dampproofing of the floor slab would be required,  
however, in accordance with Section 1805.2.1.  
1805.1.2 Under-floor space. Essentially, the requirements of this section are designed to prevent  
any ponding of water in under-floor areas such as crawl spaces. Crawl spaces are particularly  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsusceptible to ponding of water as they are usually uninhabitable spaces that are infrequently  
observed. Water can build up in these spaces and remain for an extended period of time without  
being noticed by the building occupants. This is also to prevent water from ponding under the  
structure if it is flooded. Under-floor spaces of Group R-3 buildings located in flood hazard areas  
that meet the requirements of FEMA-TB-11 need not comply with the requirements in this  
section.  
Stagnant water collected under a building can result in a serious health concern. Water  
buildup in a crawl space can also damage the structural integrity of the building. Untreated wood  
exposed to water can deteriorate and rot, and concrete and masonry exposed to water can  
deteriorate with a loss of strength.  
Steel exposed to water or high humidity can eventually rust to the extent that effective  
structural capability is jeopardized. Water buildup in a crawl space can also damage mechanical  
or electrical appliances located in the space by causing corrosion of electrical parts or metal skins  
and deterioration of insulation used to protect heating elements.  
Where it is known that the water table can rise to within 6 inches \(152 mm\) of the outside  
ground level, or where there is evidence that surface water cannot readily drain from the site,  
then the finished ground surface in under-floor spaces is to be set at an elevation equal to the  
outside ground level around the building perimeter unless an approved drainage system is  
provided. For the drainage system to be approved, it must be demonstrated that the system will  
be adequate to prevent water infiltration into the under-floor space. This is done by determining  
the maximum possible water flow near the foundation wall and footing, and designing the  
drainage system to remove that flow of water as it occurs, thereby preventing water buildup at  
the foundation wall.  
To prevent water ponding in the under-floor space from a rise in the ground-water table, or  
from storm water runoff, the finished ground level of an under-floor space is not to be located  
below the bottom of the foundation footings.  
Dampproofing, waterproofing, or providing subsoil drainage is not necessary if the ground  
level of the under-floor space is as high as the ground level at the outside of the building  
perimeter, as the foundation walls do not enclose an interior space below grade.  
Compliance with Sections 1805.2, 1805.3, and 1805.4 would be required where the finished  
ground surface of the under-floor space is below the outside ground level.  
1805.1.3 Ground-water control. After completion of building construction, it is necessary to  
maintain the water table at a level that is at least 6 inches \(152 mm\) below the bottom of the  
lower floor to prevent the flow or seepage of water into the basement. Where the site consists of  
well-draining soil and the highest point of the water table occurs naturally at or lower than the  
required level, there is no need to provide any kind of a site drainage system specifically  
designated to control the ground-water level. Where the soil characteristics and the site  
topography are such that the water table can rise to a level that will produce a hydrostatic  
pressure against the basement structure, a site drainage system may be installed to reduce the  
water level. When ground-water control in accordance with this section is provided,  
waterproofing in accordance with Section 1805.3 is not required.  
There are many types of site drainage systems that can be employed to control ground-water  
levels. The most commonly used systems may involve the installation of drainage ditches or  
trenches filled with pervious materials, sump pits and discharge pumps, well point systems,  
drainage wells with deep-well pumps, sand-drain installations, and so on. This section requires  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthat all such systems be designed and constructed using accepted engineering principles and  
practices based on considerations that include soil permeability, amount and rate at which water  
enters the system, pump capacity, disposal area capacity, and other such factors that are  
necessary for the complete design of an effective drainage system.  
1805.2 Dampproofing. Where a ground-water table investigation has established that the high  
water table will occur at such a level that the building substructure will not be subjected to  
significant hydrostatic pressure, then dampproofing in accordance with this section and a subsoil  
drain in accordance with Section 1805.4 are considered sufficient to control moisture in the floor  
below grade.  
Wood foundation systems specified in Section 1807.1.4 are to be dampproofed as required by  
the American Wood Council Permanent Wood Foundation \(AWC PWF\) standard.  
1805.2.1 Floors. Floors requiring dampproofing in accordance with Section 1805.2 are to  
employ materials specified in Section 1805.2.1. The dampproofing materials must be placed  
between the floor construction and the supporting gravel or stone base, as shown in Figure 1805-  
1\. Even if a floor base is not required, dampproofing should be placed under the slab.  
Figure 1805-1 A foundation drainage system.  
The installation is intended to provide a moisture barrier against water vapor passage or  
seepage into below-ground spaces.  
The dampproofing material most commonly used for underslab installations consists of a  
polyethylene film not less than 6 mil in thickness, which is applied over the gravel or stone base  
required in Section 1805.4.1. Care must be taken in the installation of the material over the rough  
surface of the base and during the concreting operation so as not to puncture the polyethylene.  
Joints must be lapped at least 6 inches \(152 mm\).  
Dampproofing materials can also be applied on top of the base concrete slab if a separate  
floor is provided above the base slab, because the dampproofing is provided to prevent moisture  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationinfiltration of the interior space, and not the concrete slab.  
1805.2.2 Walls. Walls requiring dampproofing in accordance with Section 1805.2 are first to be  
prepared as required in Section 1805.2.2.1, then coated with bituminous materials or by other  
approved materials and methods of application. Approved materials are those that will prevent  
moisture from penetrating the foundation wall.  
Coatings are applied to cover prepared exterior wall surfaces extending from the top of the  
wall footings to slightly above ground level so that the entire wall that contacts the ground is  
protected. Surfaces are usually primed to provide a bond coat and then dampproofed with a  
protection coat of asphalt or tar pitch.  
Dampproofing materials for walls may be any of the materials specified in Section 1805.3.2  
for waterproofing. Surface-bonding mortar complying with ASTM C887 may be utilized. This  
specification covers the materials, properties, and packaging of dry, combined materials for use  
as surface-bonding mortar with concrete masonry units that have not been prefaced, coated, or  
painted. Because this specification does not address design or application, the manufacturer’s  
recommendations should be followed. This standard covers proportioning, physical  
requirements, sampling, and testing. The minimum thickness of the coating is ⅛ inch \(3.2 mm\).  
Acrylic-modified cement coatings may be utilized at the rate of 3 pounds per square yard \(16  
N/m2\). These types of materials have been used successfully as dampproofing materials for  
foundation walls. Surface-bonding mortar and acrylic-modified cement are limited in use to  
dampproofing. The ability of these two types of products to bridge nonstructural cracks, as  
required in Section 1805.3.2 for waterproofing materials, is not known. Therefore, their use is  
limited to dampproofing and they are not permitted to be used as waterproofing. Dampproofing  
may also include other materials and methods of installation acceptable to the building official.  
1805.2.2.1 Surface preparation of walls. Before applying dampproofing materials, the concrete  
must be free of any holes or recesses that could affect the proper sealing of the wall surfaces. Air  
trapped beneath the dampproofing coating or membranes can cause blistering. Rocks and other  
sharp objects can puncture membranes. Irregular surfaces can also create uneven layering of  
coatings, which can result in vulnerable areas of dampproofing. Surface irregularities commonly  
associated with concrete wall construction can be sealed with bituminous materials or filled with  
portland cement grout or other approved materials.  
Unit masonry walls are usually parged \(plastered\) with a ½-inch-thick \(12.7 mm\) layer of  
portland cement and sand mix \(1\:2½ by volume\) or with a Type M mortar proportioned in  
accordance with the requirements of ASTM C 270 and applied in two ¼-inch-thick \(6.35 mm\)  
layers. In no case is parging to result in a final thickness of less than ⅜ inch \(9.5 mm\). The  
parging is to be coved at the joint formed by the base of the wall and the top of the wall footing  
to prevent water accumulation at that location.  
The moisture protection of unit masonry walls provided by the parging method may not be  
required where approved dampproofing materials such as grout coatings, cement-based paints, or  
bituminous coatings can be applied directly to the masonry surfaces.  
1805.3 Waterproofing. Waterproofing installations are intended to provide moisture barriers  
against water seepage that may be forced into below-ground spaces by hydrostatic pressure.  
Where a ground-water table investigation has established that the high water table will occur  
at such a level that the building substructure will be subjected to hydrostatic pressure, and where  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe water table is not lowered by a water control system, as described in the discussion of Section  
1805.4.2, all floors and walls below ground level are to be waterproofed in accordance with  
Sections 1805.3.1 and 1805.3.2.  
1805.3.1 Floors. Because floors required to be waterproofed are subjected to hydrostatic uplift  
pressures, such floors must, for all practical purposes, be made of concrete and designed and  
constructed to resist the maximum hydrostatic pressures possible. It is particularly important that  
the floor slab be properly designed, as severe cracking or movement of the concrete would allow  
water seepage into below-ground spaces. The ability of the waterproofing materials to bridge  
cracks is limited. Concrete floor construction is to comply with the applicable provisions of  
Chapter 19.  
Materials used for waterproofing below-ground floors are to conform to the requirements of  
Section 1805.3.1. Below-ground floors subjected to hydrostatic uplift pressures are to be  
waterproofed with membrane materials placed as underslab or split-slab installations, including  
such materials as rubberized asphalt, butyl rubber, and neoprene, or with polyvinyl chloride or  
polybutylene films not less than 6 mil in thickness, lapped at least 6 inches \(152 mm\). All  
membrane joints are to be lapped and sealed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions  
to form a continuous, impermeable waterproof barrier. There are many proprietary membrane  
products available that are specifically made for waterproofing floors and walls \(i.e.,  
polyethylene sheets sandwiched between layers of asphalt\), which may be used when approved  
by the building official. Products that have an ICC-ES evaluation report are acceptable in most  
jurisdictions if the requirements of the evaluation report are followed. ICC-ES reports are  
intended to address the technical aspects and requirements of new and innovative products that  
are approved by the building official under the alternative materials and methods of construction  
provisions of Section 104.11. All ICC-ES evaluation reports are posted online at www.icc-  
es.org.  
1805.3.2 Walls. Walls that are required to be waterproofed in accordance with Section 1805.3  
must first be prepared as required in this section and then waterproofed with the required  
membrane-type installations.  
The walls must be designed to resist the hydrostatic pressure anticipated at the site, as well as  
any other lateral loads to which the wall will be subjected, such as soil pressures or seismic  
loads. As with the floors required to be waterproofed, it is particularly important that the walls  
required to be waterproofed be properly designed to resist all anticipated loads, as cracking and  
other damages would allow water seepage into below-ground spaces. Concrete or masonry  
construction must comply with the applicable provisions of Chapters 19 and 21, respectively.  
Waterproofing installations are to extend from the bottom of the wall to a height not less than  
12 inches \(305 mm\) above the maximum elevation of the ground-water table. The remainder of  
the wall below ground level \(if the height is small\) may be either waterproofed as a continuation  
of the installation or must be dampproofed in accordance with the requirements of Section  
1805.2.  
This section requires that waterproofing consist of two-ply hot-mopped felts. Waterproofing  
industry practice is to select the number of plies of membrane material based on the hydrostatic  
head \(height of water pressure against the wall\). As a general practice, if the head of water is  
between 1 and 3 feet \(305 and 914 mm\), two plies of felt or fabric membrane are used; between  
4 and 10 feet \(1,219 and 3,048 mm\), three-ply construction is needed; and between 11 and 25  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfeet \(3,353 and 7,620 mm\), four-ply construction is necessary.  
Waterproofing installations may also use polyvinyl chloride materials of not less than 6-mil  
thick, 40-mil polymer-modified asphalt, or 6-mil polyethylene. These materials have been widely  
recognized for their effectiveness in bridging nonstructural cracks. Other approved materials and  
methods may be used, provided that the same performance standards are met. All membrane  
joints must be lapped and sealed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.  
1805.3.2.1 Surface preparation of walls. Before applying waterproofing materials to concrete  
or masonry walls, the wall surfaces must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
Section 1805.2.2.1, which requires the sealing of all holes and recesses. Surfaces to be  
waterproofed must also be free of any projections that might puncture or tear membrane  
materials that are applied over the surfaces.  
1805.3.3 Joints and penetrations. This section requires that all joints occurring in floors and  
walls and at locations where floors and walls meet, as well as all penetrations in floors and walls,  
be made watertight by approved methods. Sealing the joints and penetrations in the  
waterproofing is of primary importance to ensure waterproofing effectiveness. If the joints or  
penetrations are not sealed properly, they can develop leaks, which become a passageway for  
water to enter the building. Because the remainder of the foundation is wrapped in  
waterproofing, moisture can actually become trapped in the foundation walls or floor slab, and  
serious damage to these structural components can occur.  
Methods may involve the use of construction keys between the base of the wall and the top of  
the footing, or, if there is a hydrostatic pressure, floor and wall joints may require the use of  
manufactured waterstops made of metal, rubber, plastic, or mastic materials. Floor edges along  
the walls and floor expansion joints may employ any of a number of preformed expansion joint  
materials, such as asphalt, polyurethane, sponge rubber, self-expanding cork, and cellular fibers  
bonded with bituminous materials, which all comply with applicable ASTM standards or other  
approved specifications. A variety of sealants may be used together with the preformed joint  
materials. Gaskets made of neoprene and other materials are also available for use in concrete  
and masonry joints. The National Roofing Contractors Association \(NRCA\) roofing and  
waterproofing manuals provide details for the reinforcement of membrane terminations, corners,  
intersections of slabs and walls, through-wall and slab penetrations, and other locations.  
Penetrations in walls and floors may be made watertight with grout or manufactured fill  
materials and sealants made for the purpose.  
1805.4 Subsoil drainage system. Subsoil drainage systems are required to drain the area  
adjacent to basement walls to eliminate hydrostatic loads. This section covers subsoil drainage  
systems in conjunction with dampproofing \(see Section 1805.2\) to protect below-ground spaces  
from water seepage. Such systems are not used where basements or other below-ground spaces  
are subject to hydrostatic pressure, because they would not be effective in disposing of the  
amount of water anticipated if hydrostatic pressure conditions exist. Ground-water tables may be  
reduced to acceptable levels by methods described in the discussion of Section 1805.1.3. The  
details of subsoil drainage systems are covered in the requirements of Sections 1805.4.1 through  
1805.4.3.  
1805.4.1 Floor base course. This section requires that floors of basements, except for story-  
above-grade-plane construction, must be placed on a gravel or stone base not less than 4 inches  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation\(102 mm\) thick. Not more than 10 percent of the material is to pass a No. 4 \(4.75 mm\) sieve to  
provide a porous installation and provide a capillary break. Material that passes a No. 4 \(4.75  
mm\) sieve would be silt or clay that does not permit the free movement of water through the  
floor base, but allows for upward migration by capillary action.  
This requirement serves three purposes. The first is to provide an adjustment to the  
irregularities of a compacted subgrade so as to produce a level surface upon which to cast a  
concrete slab. The second purpose is to provide a capillary break so that moisture from the soil  
below will not rise to the underside of the floor. Finally, where required, the porous base can act  
as a drainage system to expel underslab water by means of gravity, or the use of a sump pump or  
other approved method.  
The exception allows for the omission of the floor base when the natural soils beneath the  
floor slab consist of well-draining granular materials such as sand, stone, or mixtures of these  
materials. Some caution, however, is justified in the use of this exception. If the granular soils  
contain an excessive percentage of fine materials, the porosity and the ability of the soil to  
provide a capillary break may be considerably diminished. The exception should be applied only  
if the natural base is equivalent to the floor base otherwise required by this section.  
1805.4.2 Foundation drain. This section describes in considerable detail the materials and  
features of construction required for the installation of foundation drain systems.  
This type of drain system is suitable where the water table occurs at such elevation that there  
is minimal hydrostatic pressure exerted against the basement floor and walls and where the  
amount of seepage from the surrounding soil is so small that the water can be readily discharged  
by gravity or by mechanical means into sewers or ditches. The objective is to combine the  
protection afforded by the dampproofing of walls and floors \(see Section 1805.2\) and that given  
by the perimeter drains to maintain below-ground spaces in a dry condition.  
A foundation drain system usually consists of the installation of drain tiles made of clay or  
concrete or of drain pipes of corrugated metal or nonmetallic pipes surrounded by crushed stone  
or gravel and a filter membrane material \(filter fabric\). The foundation drain is set adjacent to the  
wall footing and extends around the perimeter of the building. Drain tiles are placed end to end  
with open joints to permit water to enter the system. Metallic and nonmetallic drains are made  
with perforations at the invert \(bottom\) section of the pipe and are installed with connected ends.  
Where drain tile or perforated drain pipe is used, the invert must not be set higher than the  
basement floor line so that water conveyed by the drain does not seep into the filter material and  
then create a hydrostatic pressure condition against the foundation wall and footing. The inverts  
should not be placed below the bottom of the adjacent wall footings to avoid carrying away fine  
soil particles whose loss, in time, could possibly undermine the footing and cause settlement of  
the foundation walls.  
Tile joints or pipe perforations should be covered with an approved filter membrane material  
to prevent them from becoming clogged and to prevent fine particles that may be contained in  
the surrounding soil from entering the system and being carried away by water.  
The gravel or crushed stone fill material around the drain tiles or pipes should contain not  
more than 10 percent of material that passes a No. 4 \(4.75 mm\) sieve. The crushed stone or  
gravel should be selected to prevent the movement of particles from the protected soil  
surrounding the drain installation into the drain. Crushed stone or gravel fill material is to be  
placed in the excavation so that it will extend out from the edge of the wall footing a distance of  
at least 12 inches \(305 mm\), with the bottom of the fill being no higher than the bottom of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbase under the floor \(see Section 1805.4.1\) and not less than 6 inches \(152 mm\) above the top of  
the footing.  
Requiring the bottom of the foundation drain to be no higher than the bottom of the floor base  
is necessary so that if the water table rises into the floor base, it will also be able to rise  
unobstructed into the foundation drain. The foundation drain will then drain the water away from  
the building, as required by Section 1805.4.3. The top of the fill material must be covered with  
an approved filter membrane to allow water to pass through to the perimeter drain tile or pipes  
without allowing fine soil materials to enter the drainage system.  
Drain tiles or pipes are to be installed on at least 2 inches \(51 mm\) of crushed stone or gravel  
material and covered with at least 6 inches \(152 mm\) of the same material to maintain good  
water flow into the drain tile or pipe.  
1805.4.3 Drainage discharge. This section references the International Plumbing Code® \(IPC®\)  
for piping system installation requirements for disposal of water from the floor base and the  
foundation drains. Chapter 11 of the IPC considers the piping materials, applicable standards,  
and methods of installation of subsurface storm drains to facilitate water discharge either by  
gravity or by mechanical means.  
Where the soil at the site consists of well-drained granular materials such as gravel or sand-  
gravel mixtures to prevent the occurrence of hydrostatic pressure against the foundation walls  
and under the floor slab, the use of a dedicated drainage system as prescribed in the IPC is not  
required, because the site soils would permit natural drainage.  
Section 1806 Presumptive Load-Bearing Values of Soils  
1806.1 Load combinations. The presumptive bearing values in the code are allowable stress  
values, not strength level values. The allowable foundation pressures are permitted to be  
increased by one-third with the alternative ASD load combinations of Section 1605.3.2 for  
combinations including wind or earthquake even though the one-third stress increase has been  
removed for structural materials \(see discussion of Section 1605.2 for more information\).  
1806.2 Presumptive load-bearing values. The presumptive allowable bearing and lateral  
pressures must be used unless a geotechnical investigation substantiates higher values. The term  
“unprepared fill” refers to fill that was not placed and compacted in accordance with an approved  
soils report.  
The classifications in Table 1806.2 are from the Unified Soil Classification System. Most  
foundation-bearing strata can be classified into one of the classifications in the table. The  
allowable bearing pressures and lateral-bearing values are based on long-term experience with  
the behavior of these materials. However, the presumptive value for CL and CH may not be  
conservative for “soft” clays, depending on the degree of consolidation of the clay. The selection  
of an allowable bearing pressure should take into account the strength of weaker underlying soil  
strata so that the pressure in any weaker stratum does not exceed the allowable pressure,  
particularly in clay soils. Because of this, it is important to know the soil profile and  
classifications of the different strata.  
1806.3 Lateral load resistance. Sections 1806.3.1 through 1806.3.4 deal with lateral load  
calculations when using the presumptive load-bearing values of Table 1806.2. The limitation on  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfrictional resistance for silts and clays is intended to provide structural stability and improve  
serviceability.  
Table 1806-1. Presumptive Load-Bearing Values  
The formulae for lateral bearings employing posts and poles \(found in IBC Section 1807.3,  
embedded posts and poles\) were originally for outdoor advertising structures. For these  
structures, deflections of ½ inch \(12.7 mm\) at the surface do not affect serviceability. Thus, the  
allowance of two times the tabular value for these structures is permitted.  
Section 1807 Foundation Walls, Retaining Walls, and  
# Embedded Posts and Poles  
1807.1 Foundation walls. Foundation walls of materials such as concrete and masonry, rubble  
stone, or wood are addressed in Section 1807. Per Section 1807.1.1, lateral soil loads that must  
be considered in foundation wall design are covered in Section 1610. If a drainage system is not  
placed behind the wall to drain ground water away from the wall, hydrostatic pressures, which  
can easily exceed the lateral pressures from the retained soil, will occur. For example, the active  
lateral pressure from a well-graded granular soil may be in the range of 30 to 35 pounds per  
square foot \(1.44 to 1.68 kPa\), whereas the hydrostatic pressure is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot  
\(999.6 kg/m3\). Hence, the equivalent fluid pressures on a wall that was designed as drained, but  
constructed without an effective drainage system, could be subjected to pressures approximately  
three times the design pressure.  
Unbalanced backfill height and its method of measurement are presented in Section 1807.1.2  
and rubble stone foundation walls in Section 1807.1.3. Because rubble masonry uses rough  
stones of irregular shape and size, a larger thickness, as compared to hollow unit masonry or  
concrete, is required for adequate bonding of the stone and mortar. Rubble stone foundation  
walls are not permitted in SDC C, D, E, or F.  
1807.1.4 Permanent wood foundation systems. The requirements set forth in AWC PWF must  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbe followed. The wood foundation system is an assembly similar to a fire assembly—no  
substitution of materials or methods is allowed. All lumber and plywood must be treated in  
accordance with AWPA U1 \(Commodity Specification A, Special Requirement 4.2\) and must be  
identified and labeled in accordance with Section 2303.1.9.1.  
All hardware and fasteners must be corrosion resistant. Metals in contact with the preservative  
salts will corrode at a much faster rate than normal because of the influence of the salts. Hence,  
only corrosion-resistant fasteners made of silicon bronze, copper, or Type 304 or 316 stainless  
steel may be used, except that hot-dipped galvanized nails may be used when installed under the  
specific conditions set forth in the technical report for surface treatment of the nails and moisture  
protection of the foundation.  
1807.1.5 Concrete and masonry foundation walls. Foundation walls must be designed within  
the applicable provisions of IBC Chapters 19 and 21. However, if the foundation wall is laterally  
supported at the top and bottom, such as a basement wall laterally supported by a floor  
diaphragm at the top and a basement floor slab at the base, the wall may be constructed in  
accordance with the prescriptive provisions of Section 1807.1.6 and its associated tables. These  
tables allow the use of unreinforced and plain \(lightly reinforced\) concrete or masonry walls that  
have been used in low or very low seismic risk areas.  
Additionally, if the prescriptive provisions are used, sufficient soil investigation should be  
done to properly classify the retained soils as indicated in the tables in accordance with the  
Unified Soil Classification Method \(see IBC Section 1803.5.1\).  
1807.1.6 Prescriptive design of concrete and masonry foundation walls. The requirements  
and provisions of Sections 1807.1.6.1 through 1807.1.6.3.2 are applicable to the prescriptive  
design of concrete and masonry foundation walls that are laterally supported at the top and  
bottom. The minimum wall thicknesses are specified in the appropriate sections, based on the  
thickness of the supported wall, soil loads, unbalanced backfill height, and overall height of the  
wall. These minimum thickness provisions are to facilitate support of the wall above. These  
thickness provisions are empirical and have been used successfully in low or very low seismic  
risk areas. Additional seismic requirements for concrete and masonry foundation walls are  
covered in Sections 1807.1.6.2.1 \(concrete\) and 1807.1.6.3.2 \(masonry\), based on the SDC of the  
building.  
1807.1.6.2 Concrete foundation walls. This section specifies the material requirements for  
walls constructed in accordance with the prescriptive tables. Note the effective depth,  
“d,  
” in  
Section 1807.1.6.2\(3\). Placement of reinforcing at the prescribed “d” is critical to develop  
adequate flexural strength necessary to resist the combined vertical and lateral loads.  
The concrete section contains seven specific requirements to prescriptively select a foundation  
wall. Concern has been expressed that the prescriptive foundation wall provisions do not impose  
a limitation on the maximum axial loads that the walls should support. To resolve this concern, a  
conservative maximum unfactored axial load of 1.2t for concrete and 1.2t for masonry are  
included in the requirements. The maximum unfactored axial load is based on a compressive  
stress on the outside face of the wall that is due to the axial load and bending moment induced by  
the backfill that is well below that permitted by ACI 318 or TMS 402. Although this axial load  
limitation has merit, it requires a calculation to determine actual maximum axial load acting on a  
given wall. Table 1807-1 shows the maximum unfactored allowable axial load for the typical  
concrete foundation wall.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTable 1807-1. Maximum Permissible Axial Load for Concrete Walls Based on 1.2tf′  
c in  
Pounds per Foot of Wall  
1807.1.6.2.1 Seismic requirements. Seismic requirements for concrete foundation walls  
constructed in accordance with Table 1807.1.6.2 are as follows\:  
1\. 2. SDCs A and B—One \#5 bar is required at a minimum around window and door  
openings, which must extend beyond the corners of the openings or be anchored so as to  
develop fy in tension at the corner of openings.  
SDCs C, D, E, and F—The prescriptive tables are not allowed to be used except as  
permitted for plain concrete members in accordance with Section 1905.1.7, which  
modifies ACI 318, Section 14.1.4. The modification states that structural plain concrete  
members are not permitted in SDC C, D, E, or F except for structural plain concrete  
basement, foundation, or other walls below the base in detached one- and two-family  
dwellings three stories or less in height constructed with stud-bearing walls. Additional  
restrictions apply to dwellings in SDC D or E, where the walls cannot exceed 8 feet  
\(2,438 mm\) in height, cannot be less than 7.5 inches \(190 mm\) thick, and can retain no  
more than 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) of unbalanced fill. A final requirement states that the walls  
must be reinforced in accordance with ACI Section 14.6.1.  
1807.1.6.3 Masonry foundation walls. This section contains requirements for masonry  
foundation walls, both plain and with reinforcement. Masonry is required to be solid in order to  
distribute the concentrated force, or hollow units must be solidly grouted as noted in Footnote c  
of the plain masonry foundation wall Table 1807.1.6.3\(1\). The masonry section contains 10  
specific requirements for prescriptive selection of a masonry foundation wall.  
Table 1807-2 shows the maximum unfactored allowable axial load for the typical masonry  
foundation wall. Also see the discussion under Section 1807.1.6.2, Concrete foundation walls.  
Table 1807-2. Maximum Permissible Axial Load for Masonry Walls Based on 1.2tf′  
m in  
Pounds per Foot of Wall  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1807.1.6.3.1 Alternative foundation wall reinforcement. The code permits equivalent cross  
section of reinforcing, provided the spacing does not exceed 72 inches \(1,829 mm\) and the bar  
size does not exceed \#11 \(M \#36\). If alternative reinforcement is used, it is preferable to reduce  
bar size and spacing rather than increase bar size and spacing. In development of the reinforcing,  
the bar size must be small enough that the reinforcing, and any splices, can be adequately  
developed. Development refers to the embedment of the reinforcing to adequately develop the  
bond between the reinforcing and the grout. A good rule of thumb to prevent splitting of concrete  
masonry is that the bar size number should not exceed t − 1, where t is the nominal thickness of  
the wall in inches.  
1807.1.6.3.2 Seismic requirements \(masonry\). Table 1807-3 summarizes requirements for  
masonry foundation walls based on SDC and gives applicable sections of the TMS Code.  
Table 1807-3. Seismic Requirements for Masonry Foundation Walls  
Seismic requirements for masonry foundation walls constructed in accordance with Tables  
1807.1.6.3\(1\) through 1807.1.6.3\(4\) are as follows\:  
1\. 2. SDCs A and B—No additional requirements apply.  
SDC C—Additional requirements cover discontinuous members that are part of the  
lateral-force-resisting system, such as columns, pilasters, and beams that support  
reactions from walls or frames, but no specific requirements for foundation walls. Refer  
to Section 7.4.3 of TMS 402 for other requirements.  
3\. SDC D—Must conform to the requirements of SDC C, as well as Section 7.4.4 of TMS  
402.  
4\. SDCs E and F—Must conform to the requirements of SDCs C and D, as well as Section  
7.4.5 of TMS 402.  
1807.2 Retaining walls. The IBC requires retaining walls to be designed to resist overturning,  
sliding, excessive foundation pressure, and water uplift. The design of walls retaining more than  
6 feet of soil and located within SDC D or above are also required to be checked for seismic  
earth pressure.  
The design is required to meet a minimum safety factor of 1.5 in relation to sliding and  
overturning. If the design includes the seismic earth pressure, the safety factor for sliding and  
overturning can be reduced to 1.1. Figure 1807-1 shows typical loads that are considered in  
retaining wall design. Dry-cast concrete units used in the construction of segmental retaining  
walls shall comply with ASTM C1372.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1807-1 Forces affecting a retaining wall.  
1807.3 Embedded posts and poles. The criteria, originally developed for design of outdoor  
advertising structures, relate to lateral bearing and apply to a vertical pole considered a column  
embedded in either earth or in a concrete footing in the earth and used to resist lateral loads. The  
IBC employs allowable lateral-bearing stresses in IBC Table 1806.2, which are considerably  
lower than those developed for this section. Consequently, Section 1806.3.4 permits a doubling  
of the lateral-bearing values for isolated poles and poles supporting structures that can safely  
tolerate the ½-inch \(12.7 mm\) movement at the ground surface.  
1807.3.1 Limitations. The limitations imposed by this section are intended for both structural  
stability and serviceability. The limitations on the types of construction that use the lateral  
support of poles are based on the brittle nature of the materials. To prevent excessive distortions  
that would cause the cracking of these brittle materials, the code limits the use of the poles unless  
some type of rigid cross-bracing is provided to limit the deflections to those that can be tolerated  
by the materials.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationWood poles must be treated in accordance with AWPA U1. Sawn timber posts are  
Commodity Specification A, Use Category 4B, and round timber posts are Commodity  
Specification B, Use Category 4B.  
1807.3.2 Design criteria. See IBC Section 1806.3 for allowable values of lateral bearing. Note  
that the two-times increase allowed per Section 1806.3.4 may only be used for structures where  
deflection of ½ inch \(12.7 mm\) at the surface is tolerable, for example, signs, flagpoles, and light  
poles.  
1807.3.2.1 Nonconstrained. This formula should be used only for minor foundations of  
moderate size, which will fit within the constraints of the data from which the formula was  
developed. For large-sized piers, that is, more than 2 feet \(610 mm\) in diameter, a more  
appropriate method should be used.  
1807.3.2.2 Constrained. The term pavement means a rigid pavement such as reinforced concrete  
that will form a fulcrum for the column. Columns in flexible pavements such as asphalt concrete  
must use the formula in Section 1807.3.2.1 for unconstrained conditions.  
1807.3.2.3 Vertical load. There is no requirement to consider a combined lateral and vertical  
load.  
1807.3.3 Backfill. In order for the pole to meet the conditions of research that resulted in the  
code formula, the code requires that the backfill in the annular space around a column that is not  
embedded in a concrete footing be either of 2,000 psi \(13.8 MPa\) concrete, CLSM, or of clean  
sand thoroughly compacted by tamping in layers not more than 8 inches \(203 mm\) in depth.  
Backfill in the space around columns not embedded in poured footings shall be concrete, clean  
sand or CLSM.  
Section 1808 Foundations  
1808.1 General. The provisions of Section 1808 apply to all foundations. The two general types  
of foundations are shallow foundations and deep foundations. Specific requirements for shallow  
foundations and deep foundations are located in Sections 1809 and 1810, respectively. Section  
202 defines a shallow foundation as an individual or strip footing, a mat foundation, a slab-on-  
grade foundation, or a similar foundation element. A deep foundation is defined as a foundation  
that does not meet the definition of a shallow foundation.  
1808.2 Design for capacity and settlement. Footings should be designed for approximately  
equal settlements to minimize differential settlements. For footings on sands, this may require  
unequal footing pressures to affect equal settlements. Expansive soils are addressed in Section  
1808.6.  
1808.3 Design loads. Footings are to be designed using full dead load \(including overlying fill  
materials\), floor and roof live loads, snow load, wind or seismic forces, and any other loads  
required by Section 1605 that will produce the most severe loading. Live loads acting at the  
foundation may be reduced based on the reduced probability of simultaneous occurrence of  
maximum live loads. This section specifically permits live load reduction as specified in Sections  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1607.12 and 1607.14 for the foundation design.  
1808.3.1 Seismic overturning. When strength design loads are used to proportion the  
foundations, the seismic overturning effects are permitted to be reduced in accordance with  
ASCE 7 Section 12.13.4. This maximum recognizes that the seismic forces determined in  
accordance with the ASCE 7 standard are based on strength design, not allowable stress design  
\(ASD\). Foundations proportioned in accordance with ASD procedures have historically  
performed satisfactorily. Because of expected deviation from the results from the equivalent  
lateral force method, which assumes a fixed base of the building, overturning effects at the  
foundation are permitted to be reduced 25 percent for structures other than inverted pendulum or  
cantilever column systems when designed by the equivalent lateral force procedure. Overturning  
effects at the foundation are permitted to be reduced 10 percent for structures designed by the  
modal analysis method because of the higher degree of accuracy of the procedure. Note that  
these reductions cannot be used with the alternative basic ASD load combinations of Section  
1605.2.  
1808.3.2 Surcharge. This section describes how surcharge loads could affect an adjacent  
structure. Fill or other surcharge loads are not permitted to be placed adjacent to a building or  
structure unless it is capable of withstanding the additional loads caused by the surcharge load.  
Existing footings or foundations that could be affected by an excavation must be protected from  
detrimental lateral or vertical movement and settlement. The exception allows minor grading for  
landscaping with limited grading heights using walk-behind equipment which does not induce  
high forces against an adjacent foundation or wall when approved by the building official.  
1808.4 Vibratory loads. Footings supporting equipment should be designed to minimize the  
transmission of vibratory loads to the soils. The dynamic interaction of the footing, equipment,  
and soil mass should be analyzed, and the footing “tuned” to minimize the transmission. As a  
rough rule of thumb, footings for rotating or reciprocating equipment should have a mass that is  
at least four times the mass of the equipment.  
Vibratory loads from equipment foundations that are transmitted to the soil can cause  
significant and damaging settlements. The transmitted vibration will cause densification of  
granular materials, particularly loose or medium dense sands. The reduction in volume can cause  
large settlements depending on the initial density of the sands. In saturated granular materials,  
such as loose or medium dense sands with a high water table, the transmitted vibrations can  
cause a buildup of pore pressure and liquefaction of the sands, with resulting loss of bearing  
capacity and settlements. In saturated clays, the vibrations can enhance the drainage of water  
from the pores and increase long-term settlements.  
1808.5 Shifting or moving soils. An example of shifting or moving soils would be loose sands  
or expansive clay. This section of the IBC clarifies that footings should not be placed on shifting  
soils but rather placed on suitable soils. There are many means of meeting this requirement such  
as using deep foundation systems that extend through the shifting soils down to suitable  
materials or removing the poor soils and replacing with structural fill. Loose soils may also be  
improved by methods such as deep dynamic compaction, pressure grouting, and stone columns.  
If foundations will be placed in areas where shifting soils or moving soils exist, a geotechnical  
report should be provided per Section 1803 recommending what mitigation measures should be  
followed for the placement of foundations in these areas.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1808.6 Design for expansive soils. The requirements to mitigate the effects of expansive soils  
are set forth in this section. In addition to mitigation by foundation design, the effects of  
expansive soils may also be mitigated by removal of the expansive soils or stabilization by  
chemical means, pre-saturation, or dewatering. Expansive soils are cohesive soils, typically high  
plasticity clays, with a high Plasticity Index and a high Swell Index.  
1808.6.1 Foundations. The large volume changes in expansive soils caused by changes in the  
soils’ water content can cause significant differential deflections in a building if not uniform. In a  
typical building on expansive soils, the soils at the perimeter of the building will have seasonal  
moisture changes, whereas the soils at the interior of the building will remain at a fairly constant  
moisture content. The perimeter foundations will rise and fall with the seasonal volume changes  
in moisture content, whereas the soil at the interior footings or slab will not have any volume  
changes, because of constant moisture content. The resulting differential displacements between  
the interior and exterior footings can cause significant structural distress. Hence, the  
requirements that the foundation be designed to resist the differential volume changes and to  
minimize racking or differential displacements in the structure.  
1808.6.2 Slab-on-ground foundations. The slab-on-ground or raft foundation design methods  
cited in this section result in a raft that has sufficient stiffness to bridge differential displacements  
caused by the volume changes in the supporting soil. Conventionally reinforced \(nonprestressed\)  
foundations on expansive soils can be designed in accordance with WRI/CRSI Design of Slab-  
on-Ground Foundations, and post-tensioned foundations on expansive soils can be designed in  
accordance with PTI Standard Requirements for Design and Analysis of Shallow Post-Tensioned  
Concrete Foundations on Expansive and Stable Soils. Design moments, shears, and deflections  
can also be determined from each of the aforementioned applicable standards. The code also  
permits alternative methods of analysis, provided the methodology is rational and the basis for  
the analysis and design parameters are available for peer review.  
1808.6.3 Removal of expansive soil. Removal of the expansive soil is an acceptable mitigation  
method and is the preferred method if the stratum of expansive soil is near the surface and  
reasonably thin. This method may also be the least expensive method if the expansive soil is at  
the surface.  
1808.6.4 Stabilization. Expansive soils may be stabilized so that the moisture content does not  
change; hence, there will be no volume changes to cause differential displacements. Stabilization  
can be by chemical methods, by pre-saturating the soils to a maximum swell and capping the  
expansive layer to keep the moisture content constant, or by dewatering to a minimum shrinkage  
and providing drainage to keep the moisture content constant.  
1808.7 Foundations on or adjacent to slopes. The provisions of this section apply only to  
buildings placed on or adjacent to slopes steeper than one unit vertical to three units horizontal.  
1808.7.1 Building clearance from ascending slopes. This setback requirement is intended to  
provide protection to the structure from shallow slope failure \(sloughing\) and protection for  
erosion and slope drainage. The setback space also provides access around the structure and  
helps to create a light and open environment. IBC Figure 1808.7.1 depicts the criterion for the  
clearance as the smaller of H/2 and 15 feet \(4,572 mm\). Figure 1808-1 also depicts the criteria  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationset forth in this item for determination of the toe of the slope when the slope exceeds 1\:1.  
Figure 1808-1 Buildings adjacent to ascending slope exceeding 1\:1.  
1808.7.2 Foundation setback from descending slope surface. The setback requirement at the  
top of slopes is intended to provide vertical and lateral support for the foundations and minimize  
the possibility of shallow bearing failure of the foundation because of lack of lateral support. The  
setback also provides space for drainage away from the slope without creating too steep a  
drainage profile, which could cause erosion problems. The setback space also provides access  
around the structure and helps to create a light and open environment. IBC Figure 1808.7.1  
depicts the criterion for the setback or clearance. Figure 1808-2 depicts the criteria set forth in  
this item for determination of the toe of the slope when the slope exceeds 1\:1.  
Figure 1808-2 Buildings adjacent to descending slope exceeding 1\:1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIt is possible to locate a structure closer to the slope than indicated in IBC Figure 1808.7.1.  
The footing of the structure may be located on the slope itself, provided that the depth of  
embedment of the footing is such that the face of the footing at the bearing plane is set back from  
the edge of the slope at least H/3 or 40 feet \(12,192 mm\), whichever is less.  
1808.7.3 Pools. Figure 1808-3 depicts the criteria for the design of swimming pool walls near the  
top of a descending slope. The wall must be sufficient to resist the hydrostatic water pressure  
without support from the soil to protect against failure of the pool wall should localized minor  
slope movement or sloughing occur. The pool setback should be established as one-half of the  
setback required by IBC Figure 1808.7.1 which translates to the smaller of H/6 and 20 feet  
\(6,096 mm\).  
Figure 1808-3 Swimming pool adjacent to descending slope.  
1808.7.4 Foundation elevation. Figure 1808-4 depicts the criteria from this section for the  
elevation of the exterior foundations relative to the street, gutter, or point of inlet of a drainage  
device.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1808-4 Footing elevation on graded sites.  
The elevation of the street or gutter shown is that point at which drainage from the site  
reaches the street or gutter. This requirement is intended to protect the structure from water  
encroachment in the case of heavy or unprecedented rains. This requirement may be modified if  
the building official finds that positive drainage slopes are provided to drain water away from the  
building and that the drainage pattern is not subject to temporary flooding from clogged drains,  
landscaping, or other impediments.  
1808.7.5 Alternate setback and clearance. This alternative procedure allows the building  
official to approve alternative setbacks and clearances from slopes, provided that the intent of  
Section 1808.7 is met. This section gives the building official the authority to require a  
geotechnical investigation by a qualified geotechnical engineer. The parameters for such  
geotechnical investigation are established in Section 1803.5.10 and include consideration of  
material, height of slope, slope gradient, load intensity, and erosion characteristics of the slope  
material.  
1808.8 Concrete foundations. Footings may be designed, or the requirements of Table 1809.7  
may be used, for structures with light-framed walls of conventional construction, where frost  
heave or expansive soils are not a problem. Table 1809.7 is based on anticipated dead and live  
loads from the floors and roof and an assumed soil classification of ML, MH, CL, or CH.  
1808.8.1 Concrete or grout strength and mix proportioning. Table 1808.8.1 provides the  
minimum specified compressive strength, , for concrete or grout to be used in specific  
foundation types. This table provides values for various SDCs as well as for piles and shafts. A  
compressive strength of 2,500 psi \(17.2 MPa\) is the minimum value for most footings of  
structures in SDC A, B, or C and for the footings of residential light-frame and utility structures,  
one or two stories in height, in SDCs D, E, and F. The minimum specified concrete strength of  
2,500 psi \(17.2 MPa\) is set to provide a material of adequate strength and durability. Concrete of  
lower strength may not have adequate durability, particularly in freeze-thaw areas.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSlump requirements must be adjusted for specific conditions. For example, concrete placed in  
uncased drilled holes needs to be in the 6- to 8-inch \(152- to 203- mm\) range so that the concrete  
flows readily into the irregularities in the drilled hole. Use of superplasticizers will provide the  
desired slump while keeping the water to cementitious material ratio low.  
1808.8.2 Concrete cover. Cover requirements are set to provide protection and minimize steel  
corrosion. All concrete cover requirements of Chapter 18 are organized in Table 1808.8.2.  
1808.8.3 Placement of concrete. Holes should be free from debris, loose soils, or water.  
Placement of concrete through water should be avoided because of the increased risk of  
segregation and dilution of the concrete paste. When concrete is placed under water, by tremie or  
other approved method, the mix must be different from the standard mix used for ordinary  
concrete foundations. The mix must be proportioned so that it is plastic with high workability  
and will flow without segregation. The desired consistency can be obtained by using rounded  
aggregates, high sand contents, entrained air, and superplasticizers. Higher cement contents are  
necessary to compensate for the increase in the water to cementitious materials ratio caused by  
dilution from placement through water. Minimum cement content should be 600 pounds per yard  
\(56 k/m3\). Placement from the top of deep foundations can cause segregation of concrete mix  
also, and proper measures such as the use of a funnel hopper \(elephant trunk\) should be taken to  
avoid the potential for segregation.  
When depositing concrete from the top of a deep foundation, the IBC requires concrete to be  
chuted directly into smooth-sided pipes and tubes or through a centering funnel hopper. The  
main purpose of the centering funnel for drilled piles is to prevent the concrete from  
encountering the soil at the perimeter of the hole, which is generally not a problem for pipes and  
tubes. The term smooth sided is included in the code to prevent possible segregation from the  
ridges or corrugations if nonsmooth pipes or tubes are used.  
1808.8.4 Protection of concrete. Concrete footings should not be placed during rain, sleet,  
snow, or freezing weather without protection against either freezing or increase in water content  
at the surface from rain while plastic. If concrete placement is undertaken under such conditions  
without adequate protection, numerous complications can be expected. Projects may be halted  
while concrete core samples, testing, analysis, and investigation are performed on the hardened  
concrete to determine suitability of the deposited concrete and of the structural elements. See  
ACI 306R and ACI 306.1 for cold-weather concrete operations.  
1808.8.5 Forming of concrete. The soil should have sufficient strength and cohesion that the  
shape, dimensions, and vertical sides of the excavation can be maintained without sloughing  
prior to and during the concreting operations. Excavations in loose granular materials must be  
formed.  
1808.8.6 Seismic requirements. Specific requirements for foundations in SDC C, D, E, or F are  
contained in Section 1905, which contains the modifications to ACI 318. Per Table 1808.8.1, in  
SDC D, E, or F, concrete must have a specified compressive strength of not less than 3,000 psi  
\(20.7 MPa\), except that 2,500 psi \(17.2 MPa\) concrete strength is permitted in Group R or U  
occupancies of light-frame construction two stories or less in height.  
Buildings in SDCs D, E, and F are required to comply with the seismic requirements of ACI  
318, except for detached one- and two-family dwellings of light-frame construction two stories  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationor less in height. ACI 318 covers foundation requirements in general, and also provides  
requirements for footings, mat foundations, pile caps, grade beams, and slabs on grade.  
Note that plain concrete is either unreinforced or lightly reinforced concrete that contains less  
reinforcing than required to meet the minimum reinforcement requirements set forth in ACI 318.  
1808.9 Vertical masonry foundation elements. Vertical masonry foundation elements that are  
not foundation piers are to be designed as piers, walls, or columns in accordance with TMS 402.  
Section 1809 Shallow Foundations  
1809.1 General. Foundations are divided into two major categories of shallow foundations and  
deep foundations. Shallow foundations are individual or strip footings, the bottoms of which are  
typically close to the surface. Examples include mat foundations, slab on grade, or similar  
foundation types. Shallow foundations are regulated in Sections 1809.2 through 1809.13. Deep  
foundations are those that are not classified as shallow foundations.  
1809.2 Supporting soils. Because the supporting soil for shallow foundations is close to the  
surface, in order to minimize differential settlement, shallow foundations must be constructed on  
undisturbed native soil, compacted fill material, or CLSM. Where constructed on fill, the  
material must be properly placed and compacted to achieve adequate density in accordance with  
Section 1804.6. CLSM must be placed and tested in accordance with Section 1804.7.  
1809.3 Stepped footings. Footings are required to be stepped when the slope of the bearing  
surface exceeds 1 in 10. No recommendations or restrictions are provided. Figure 1809-1  
schematically represents a satisfactory stepped foundation. The figure shows a recommended  
horizontal overlap of the top of the foundation wall beyond the step in the foundation to be larger  
than the vertical step in the foundation wall at that point. This is recommended to keep any crack  
propagation approximately at a 45-degree \(0.79 rad\) angle. To keep this cracking to a minimum,  
it is also recommended that the height of each step not exceed 1 to 2 feet \(305 to 610 mm\). Other  
measures to protect against cracking, such as special reinforcing details, may be needed. See  
Section 2308.6.8.3 for specific requirements pertaining to stepped foundations for conventional  
construction.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1809-1 Stepped foundations.  
1809.4 Depth and width of footings. Footings should always be placed a minimum of 12-inches  
\(305 mm\) deep on either firm, undisturbed earth or properly compacted fill, and be at least 12  
inches \(305 mm\) in width.  
1809.5 Frost protection. To prevent frost heave during winter and subsequent settlement upon  
thawing, foundations and building supports should be placed on a stratum with adequate load-  
bearing resistance that is below the frost line. Frost heave occurs because of the increased soil  
volume from the freezing of pore water in the soil. Clay soils, particularly saturated clays, are  
most susceptible to frost heave. Well-drained sands and gravels will not be susceptible to  
significant movement. If foundations are built on soils that can freeze, the resulting frost heave,  
which is rarely uniform, can cause serious damage from differential settlements.  
The frost line is defined as the lowest depth below the ground surface to which a temperature  
of 32°F \(0°C\) extends. The factors governing the depth of the frost line are air temperature, the  
length of time the air temperature is below freezing \(32°F\) \(0°C\), and the soil’s thermal  
conductivity. Frost lines vary significantly throughout the country from no penetration in  
southern Florida to 100 inches \(2,540 mm\) in the northern regions of Michigan and Maine. Data  
on frost penetration are available from the U.S. Department of Commerce Weather Bureau.  
The code offers three options for ensuring adequate frost protection for shallow foundations.  
The first option—the most common and simplest to accomplish—is to construct the bottom of  
the footing below the frost line for the particular locality. The second option is to construct the  
footing in accordance with the referenced standard, ASCE 32, Design and Construction of Frost-  
Protected Shallow Foundations. The third option, which is often encountered in areas where  
bedrock is prevalent, is to construct the footing on solid rock.  
Note the exception where a frost-protected foundation is not required\: free-standing buildings  
classified in Risk Category I \(see Section 1604.5\), floor area of 600 square feet \(56 m2\) or less  
for light-frame construction or 400 square feet \(37 m2\) or less for other than light-frame  
construction, and eave height of 10 feet or less. Note that the term light-frame construction is  
defined in Section 202 as a system that uses repetitive wood or cold-formed steel framing  
members.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe code prohibits footings from bearing directly on frozen soil unless the soil is permanently  
frozen. Permafrost may not meet this condition as permafrost is considered soil that remains in a  
frozen state for more than two years in a row.  
1809.5.1 Frost protection at required exits. Concrete landings that are placed at “required”  
exits must meet the frost protection requirements. Landings are typically considered  
nonstructural concrete flat work that is not extended down to frost depth. As frost heave can  
cause these landings to lift and render exits unusable, landings at all required exits must reach the  
appropriate frost depth.  
1809.6 Location of footings. This restriction is intended to minimize the influence of vertical  
and lateral loads from footings at a higher elevation on footings at a lower elevation. See Figure  
1809-2.  
Figure 1809-2 Isolated foundation.  
1809.7 Prescriptive footings for light-frame construction. Footings of concrete or masonry  
unit may be designed, or the requirements of Table 1809.7 may be used, for structures with light-  
frame walls of conventional construction, where frost heave or expansive soils are not a problem.  
IBC Table 1809.7 shown herein as Table 1809-1 is based on anticipated dead and live loads from  
the floors and roof and an assumed soil classification of ML, MH, CL, or CH.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTable 1809-1. Prescriptive Footings Supporting Walls of Light-Frame Constructiona,b,c,d,e  
1809.8 Plain concrete footings. In compliance with ACI 318, the edge thickness of plain  
concrete footings in other than light-frame construction must not be less than 8 inches \(203 mm\).  
In accordance with ACI 318, the thickness or depth used to compute footing stresses \(flexure,  
combined axial load and flexure, or shear\) should be 2 inches \(51 mm\) less than the actual  
thickness of the footing for footings cast against soil. This is done to allow for unevenness of  
excavation and contamination of the concrete adjacent to the soil.  
The edge thickness of plain concrete footings can be reduced to 6 inches \(152 mm\) for Group  
R-3 occupancies \(R-3 occupancies are described in Section 310\), provided that the edge distance  
\(projection\) of the footing beyond the face of the stem wall does not exceed the thickness \[6  
inches \(152 mm\) depth = 6 inches \(152 mm\) extension\]. Figure 1809-4 illustrates this condition.  
For lightly loaded walls, this dimensional limitation should keep the flexural stresses and the  
shear stresses below applicable design limits. These stresses should be checked for heavily  
loaded walls.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1809-3 Plain concrete footing.  
Figure 1809-4 Brick footing wall offsets.  
1809.9 Masonry-unit footings. Masonry footings were widely used until the middle of the last  
century when they were replaced by steel or wood grillage footings, which in turn were replaced  
by more economical plain or reinforced concrete footings. Masonry footings were often built of  
stone cut to a specific size, or rubble masonry of random-sized stones bonded with mortar.  
Although seldom used, masonry footings may be constructed of hard-burned brick set in cement  
mortar to support lightweight buildings.  
1809.9.1 Dimensions. Type M mortar is suitable for unreinforced masonry below grade or with  
earth contact. Type S should be used for reinforced footings. Projections of the footing beyond a  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwall or pier should not exceed one-half of the footing depth to keep the shear and flexural  
stresses in the footing within safe limits. For example, a footing with a 12-inch \(305 mm\) depth  
should project no more than 6 inches \(152 mm\) beyond the face of the wall. The footing width  
shall be at least 8 inches \(203 mm\) wider than the supported wall.  
1809.9.2 Offsets. The stepping back, or racking, of successive courses of the foundation wall  
supported by a masonry footing must not exceed 1½ inches \(38.1 mm\) for a single course or 3  
inches \(76 mm\) for a double course. Where wide footings are necessary for bearing, the wall  
must be stepped back to keep the footing projection within the limits of Section 1809.9.1. See  
Figure 1809-5.  
1809.10 Pier and curtain wall foundations. Pier foundations may not be used to support  
structures assigned to SDCs D, E, and F because seismic detailing requirements for higher SDCs  
have not been developed. These foundation elements have been popular particularly in the  
Eastern United States, and under this section are allowed only for the support of light-frame  
construction of not more than two stories above grade plane.  
1809.11 Steel grillage footings. Steel grillage footings were used extensively during the latter  
half of the last century, but the development of reinforced concrete made the use of steel grillage  
footings obsolete, except for underpinning work.  
A typical grillage consists of two or more tiers of steel beams, with each tier placed at right  
angles to the tier below. The beams in each tier are usually held together by a system of bolts and  
pipe spacers. For construction of new grillage footings, the beams should be clean and unpainted  
and the entire grillage system filled with and encased in concrete with at least 4 inches of cover.  
The grillage should be placed on a concrete pad at least 6 inches thick to distribute the load  
evenly to the soil.  
1809.12 Timber footings. Use of timber footings is allowed only for Type V structures. Timber  
must be pressure treated to American Wood Protection Association \(AWPA\) U1 \(Commodity  
Specification A, Use Category 4B\) standards, except for foundations permanently below the  
ground-water table. The pressure preservative treatment protects the timber from decay, fungi,  
and harmful insects. The AWPA Use Category System \(UCS\) is based on the end use hazard,  
similar to other international standards for wood treatment. The Use Category System \(UCS\) is  
used to specify the wood treatment based on the desired wood species and the environment of the  
intended end use. Stronger preservatives are necessary to prevent marine borers when timber  
foundations are used in coastal brackish or marine environments.  
Preservative treatment by the pressure process within the limitations of the AWPA standards  
should not significantly affect the strength of the wood. Part of the process, however, involves  
the conditioning of the wood prior to treatment by steaming or boiling under vacuum. This  
conditioning can cause reduction in strength. This strength loss is recognized in the AWC  
National Design Specification for Wood Construction \(AWC NDS\) by use of the condition  
treatment factor, Cct, which provides a reduction to certain design values for timber poles and  
piles. Note that the NDS states that load duration factors greater than 1.6 are not allowed for  
structural members that are pressure treated with water-borne preservatives. This restriction  
would apply to impact loads that have a load duration factor of 2.0.  
Untreated timber may be used when the footings are completely embedded in soil below the  
ground-water table. Experience has long shown that timber permanently confined in water will  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstay sound and durable indefinitely. Wood submerged in fresh water cannot decay, because the  
necessary air is excluded. Because ground-water levels can sometimes change appreciably,  
untreated timber should only be used at depths sufficiently below the water table so that small  
drops in the water level will not expose the timbers to air.  
1809.13 Footing seismic ties. Interconnection of individual spread footings is required for  
structures in SDCs D, E, and F sited on soils in Site Class E or F. The footings must be  
interconnected with ties capable of transmitting a force equal to the larger footing load multiplied  
by the short period response acceleration, SDS, divided by 10 or 25 percent of the smaller footing  
design gravity load, whichever is smaller. The intent of this requirement is to minimize  
differential movement or spreading between footings during ground shaking, and have individual  
footings act as a unit. If slabs on grade, or beams within slabs on grade, are used to meet the tie  
requirement, the load path from footing to slab or beam/slab and across joints in the slab or  
beam/slab should be checked for continuity. The slab or beam must be reinforced for the design  
tension load.  
Section 1810 Deep Foundations  
1810.1 General. Deep foundations are regulated in Sections 1810.1 through 1810.4 and are  
those typically referred to as piles, piers, or caissons that transfer load from a superstructure such  
as a building to the underlying soils or rock that provides support for the superstructure. Deep  
foundations are generally used when the loads are too high to be supported by shallow footings  
or mats. Load resistance is provided by skin friction between soil and the sides of the pile and by  
end bearing at the tip. Settlement has to be limited within acceptable levels and may control the  
pile capacity for design purposes.  
Deep foundations can be subjected to compression, tension, and lateral loads. The loads can  
be static and dynamic forces resulting from soil pressure, wind pressure acting on the building,  
or earthquake load effects from ground motion. In many cases, there are groups of piles, and  
group interaction must be considered. Closely spaced deep foundation elements have lower  
capacities.  
Deep foundations can be constructed of cased or uncased concrete, precast-prestressed  
concrete, timber, steel pipe or H sections, or other special types such as micropiles and helical  
piles. Piles can be either driven in place or drilled in place. The installation method for a  
particular project depends on a variety of factors such as the geotechnical engineer’s experience  
with local conditions, settlement limitations, acceptable noise levels, and so on.  
The term caisson refers to deep foundations that are required when very heavy loads are  
supported such as high-rise building towers. Caissons are large-diameter concrete elements  
installed with a casing that can be left in place. The caisson bottom can be expanded, called a  
bell bottom, to provide more bearing area or it may include a rock socket. Trump Tower in  
Chicago is a 92-story building supported on 230 caissons bearing on rock and hardpan. The core  
caissons have a record-breaking 500-ksf \(23.95 MPa\) bearing capacity with rock sockets up to  
10 feet \(3,048 mm\) in diameter.  
Within Section 1810 provisions are found for seismic design and detailing for various types of  
deep foundations in SDCs C through F. These mostly reflect concerns that significant ground  
motions can occur in SDC C. Additional requirements are imposed on deep foundation elements  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationin SDCs D through F, including a requirement that the upper portion of piles be detailed as  
special moment-resisting-frame columns, to prevent failure of the piles under severe ground  
motions. These provisions intend to include the deep foundation element bending and curvatures  
resulting from horizontal ground movement during an earthquake in the structural design. The  
reinforcement in the deep element, required to resist the curvature effect, increases ductility of  
the foundation such that bending or shear failure is precluded.  
1810.1.1 Geotechnical investigation. See Section 1803.5.5 for discussion on geotechnical  
investigations.  
1810.1.2 Use of existing deep foundation elements. This section allows the reuse of existing  
deep foundations where sufficient information is submitted to the building official to  
demonstrate they are adequate. This introduces flexibility for both the building designer and the  
building owner to make use of existing materials where it makes sense to do so.  
Deep foundations remaining after structures that are demolished should not be used for the  
support of new loads, unless evidence shows them to be adequate. This is typically because of  
the lack of soil data or detailed information on the piling material, or unavailability of the pile-  
driving or pier construction records created during construction of older buildings or structures.  
As such, the true condition of the deep foundation elements may be unknown and, over time,  
they may have deteriorated, or their load capacity may have been reduced. Such deep foundation  
elements may be used, however, if they are load tested or in the case of piles, if they are retracted  
and redriven to verify their capacities. Only the lowest allowable load capacity as determined by  
test data or redriving information should be used in the design.  
1810.1.3 Deep foundation elements classified as columns. \(Column action\) The code requires  
that deep foundation elements standing unbraced in air, water, or material not capable of  
providing adequate lateral support shall be designed in accordance with the column formulas of  
the code. Obviously, water and air do not provide lateral support. On the other hand, most soils  
do provide lateral support, although exceptionally loose and unconsolidated fills, liquified sands,  
and remolded clays are inadequate to provide lateral support. CIP elements can be designed as a  
“pedestal” under conditions where unsupported height to least horizontal dimension is three or  
less.  
1810.1.4 Special types of deep foundations. Deep foundations such as pile or pier types are  
basically classified in accordance with the structural material used, such as concrete, steel, or  
wood. They can also be categorized in accordance with the method of construction or  
installation. There are many variations of foundation types used in the construction of deep  
foundations, including some special or proprietary types beyond the scope of the code. Section  
1810 includes only those basic pile types commonly used in current construction practice.  
Special deep foundation types that are not specifically included in the provisions of the code  
are not precluded from use, provided that adequate information covering test data, calculations,  
structural properties, load capacity, and installation procedures is submitted and accepted by the  
building official.  
1810.2 Analysis. Sections 1810.2.1 through 1810.2.5 are related to the analysis methodology for  
deep foundations and apply to all deep foundations in all locations except where a specific  
analysis is called for in higher seismic active areas. The discussion of lateral support, stability,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsettlement, lateral loads, SDCs D through F, and group effects discussed below is related to  
analysis procedures and requirements.  
1810.2.1 Lateral support. This section provides needed guidance to the designer and building  
official on what constitutes adequate lateral support for deep foundations. It specifies that any  
soil other than fluid soil is allowed to be considered to provide lateral support to prevent  
buckling of deep foundation elements. Liquefaction causes loss of lateral-bearing capacity with  
resulting loss of support for deep foundation elements. Loss of lateral support can also occur  
from the soil strength loss associated with sensitive or quick clays that are sensitive to remolding  
effects. These clays lose significant strength when remolded, as might occur when a pile  
foundation is moved through muds by seismic-induced displacements.  
Portions of deep foundation elements standing unbraced in air, water, or material not capable  
of providing adequate lateral support are permitted to be considered laterally supported at a depth  
of 5 feet \(1,524 mm\) in stiff soils and at a depth of 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) in soft soils, as  
determined by the geotechnical investigation.  
1810.2.2 Stability. A group of deep foundation elements such as piles designed to support a  
common load or to resist horizontal forces must be braced or rigidly tied together to act as a  
single structural unit that will provide lateral stability in all directions. Deep foundation elements  
connected by a rigid, reinforced concrete pile cap are deemed to be sufficiently braced to meet  
the intent of this provision.  
This section clarifies that for pile or pier groups to be considered to provide lateral stability,  
they must meet the radial spacing requirements defined herein. Three or more deep foundation  
elements are generally used to support a building column load or other isolated, concentrated  
load. In a three-element group, lateral stability is assured by requiring that the elements are  
located such that they will not be less than 60 degrees \(1.05 radians\) apart as measured from the  
centroid of the group in a radial direction.  
For stability of deep foundation elements in a group supporting a wall structure, the elements  
are braced by a continuous, rigid footing and are alternately staggered in two lines at least 1 foot  
\(305 mm\) apart and symmetrically located on each side of the center of gravity of the wall. Other  
approved deep foundation element arrangements may be used to support walls, provided the  
elements are adequately braced and lateral stability of the foundation construction is assured.  
Exception 1 allows isolated CIP deep foundation elements without lateral bracing where the  
minimum dimension is 2 feet \(610 mm\), and the length must be less than or equal to 12 times the  
least dimension of the pier.  
Exception 2 allows one- and two-family dwellings of lightweight construction, such as R-3  
buildings, not exceeding two stories above grade plane or 35 feet \(10,668 mm\) in height, a single  
row of piles located within the width of the wall.  
1810.2.3 Settlement. The purpose of a settlement analysis is to provide the data needed to design  
a deep foundation system that will maintain the stability and structural integrity of the supported  
building or structure. The load-bearing stratum of every soil must support the loads transferred  
through the deep foundation system, as well as the weight of all soil above. The capability of the  
strata underlying the deep foundation element to support additional loads without detrimental  
settlement can often be determined by analytical procedures. For example, serious settlements in  
a pile foundation system, particularly differential settlements, can cause great structural damage  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationto the supported structure and the foundation itself.  
Although the settlement analysis of an individual deep foundation element is complex, the  
analysis of a group of elements is significantly more complicated because of the overlapping soil  
stresses caused by closely spaced elements. Analytical procedures vary with the type of deep  
foundation element and especially with the soil conditions. Settlement analysis would generally  
include cases involving point-bearing piles on rock, and in granular soils and hard clay. It would  
also involve friction piles in sand and gravel soils, and in clay materials.  
Load tests are often used to aid in the analysis. In the case of pile foundations in clay soils,  
however, there are no practical ways to determine long-term settlement from load tests, and  
therefore only approximations of settlement may be derived from laboratory tests.  
1810.2.4 Lateral loads. Deep foundation moments, shears, and deflections must be based on  
nonlinear soil-deep foundation element interaction. If using deep foundations in soils with lenses  
of soft clays, lenses subject to liquefaction, or soils susceptible to strength loss from remolding,  
the effects of these layers on the curvature and, hence, moment demands on the deep foundations  
should be investigated. Often these soil-induced curvatures place a much higher moment demand  
on the deep foundations than would be determined from conventional lateral force analysis. If  
the ratio of the depth of embedment of the deep foundation element to the element diameter or  
width is less than or equal to six, the deep foundation element may be assumed to be rigid.  
1810.2.4.1 Seismic design categories D through F. In addition to the requirements for SDC C,  
moments, shears, and deflections must be based on nonlinear soil–pile interaction. If using pile  
foundations in soils with layers of soft to medium stiff clays, layers subject to liquefaction, or  
soils susceptible to strength loss from remolding \(see Site Class E and F\), the effects of these  
layers on the curvature and, hence, moment demands on the pile must be investigated. Often  
these soil-induced curvatures place a much higher moment demand on the piles than would be  
determined from conventional lateral force analysis. In addition, at the interfaces of the layers  
described above and stiffer layers, plastic hinging may occur. Hence, confinement reinforcement  
per the concrete special-moment frame provisions must be provided at these interfaces and at the  
pile-to-cap connection for concrete piers and piles \(see ASCE 7 Chapter 12\). The curvature  
capacity requirements are considered to have been met without the analysis outlined in this  
section under two conditions. One condition is for precast-prestressed concrete piles where the  
transverse reinforcement detailing complies with ACI 318 Chapter 18. These provisions were  
developed specifically for precast-prestressed piles to meet the curvature requirements. The other  
condition is for CIP concrete deep foundation elements that meet a minimum longitudinal  
reinforcement ratio of 0.005 the full length of the element and detailed in accordance with ACI  
318 Chapter 18.  
1810.2.5 Group effect. Where deep foundation elements are spaced far apart, they are  
considered as individual elements and analyzed and designed accordingly based on various  
requirements of the code. As spacing between the elements is reduced, the loads and stresses  
from one element may affect surrounding deep foundation elements. This is the spacing at which  
group action must also be considered. The spacing for group action consideration in analysis of  
lateral loads is a center-to-center spacing of less than eight times the least horizontal dimension  
of an element, and for axial loads is a center-to-center spacing of less than three times the least  
horizontal dimension of a deep element. See Figure 1810-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1810-1 Group effect.  
The last sentence of this section clarifies that group effects on uplift of deep foundations  
should be evaluated where element spacing is less than three times their least horizontal  
dimension. Section 1810.3.3.1.6 is not specific in regard to the spacing that necessitates  
evaluation of group effects for uplift. Cross referencing Section 1810.3.3.1.6, uplift capacity of  
grouped deep foundation elements, helps further clarify the intent.  
Determination of the proper spacing of a pile group in relation to the type of pile foundation  
employed and the soil conditions encountered is a matter of design. Pile spacing must be such  
that the loads transferred to the load-bearing strata do not exceed the safe load-bearing values of  
the supporting strata as determined by test borings, field load tests, or other approved methods.  
1810.3 Design and detailing. Sections 1810.3.1 through 1810.3.13 are related to the design and  
detailing of deep foundations and address general requirements as well as special seismic  
requirements where applicable. The subsections of Section 1810.3 are listed in Table 1810-1.  
Table 1810-1. Deep Foundation Seismic Detailing Requirements  
Driven piles and helical piles are required to be designed and manufactured in accordance  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwith accepted engineering practice to consider handling, driving, and service conditions and are  
addressed briefly in Sections 1810.3.1.4 and 1810.3.1.5.  
1810.3.1.3 Mislocation. Because of subsurface obstructions or other reasons, it is sometimes  
necessary to offset deep foundation elements a small distance from their intended locations so  
that they are not driven out of position. In such cases, the load distribution in a group of deep  
elements may be changed from the design requirements and cause some of them to be  
overloaded. To prevent major problems from displacements, the foundation system and the  
superstructure are required to be designed to resist the effects of deep foundation mislocation of  
at least 3 inches \(76 mm\). This section requires that the maximum compressive load on any pile  
caused by mislocation not exceed 110 percent of the allowable design load. Deep elements such  
as piles exceeding this limitation must be extracted and redriven in the proper location or other  
approved remedies applied, such as installing additional piles to balance the group.  
1810.3.1.4 Driven piles. Except for steel H-piles, driven piles covered in Chapter 18 are the  
displacement type. That is, as the pile is driven, a volume of soil is displaced by the pile volume,  
resulting in compaction of the surrounding soils. Piles must be designed to resist driving and  
handling stresses in addition to anticipated service loads. In long piles, tensile stresses resulting  
from driving may govern the design. In shorter piles, the handling loads may dominate. Driven  
uncased piles are displacement piles and are constructed by driving a temporary casing,  
removing the soils from the casing, and placing concrete in the hole as the casing is removed.  
The casing is driven with a closed end, thereby displacing and compacting adjacent soil during  
driving. The casing is kept closed either by a detachable tip, which is left in place when the  
casing is withdrawn, or by a mandrel that closes off the casing tip during driving.  
1810.3.1.5 Helical piles.  
“Helical pile” is a manufactured steel deep foundation element  
consisting of a central shaft and one or more helical bearing plates. These are piles that are  
installed by rotating them into the ground very much like screwing in a rotating plate. Additional  
provisions for helical piles are found in IBC Sections 202.1 \(definition\), 1810.3.3.1.9 \(allowable  
axial load\), 1810.3.5.3.5 \(dimensions\), 1810.4.11 \(installation\), and 1705.9 \(special inspection\).  
1810.3.1.6 Casings. Casings are used in many deep foundation systems. The steel-cased pile is  
the most widely used type of CIP concrete pile. This pile type is characterized by a thin steel  
shell and is a displacement pile. This pile type consists of a closed-end light-gauge steel shell or  
a thin-walled pipe driven into the soil and left permanently in place, reinforced when required for  
uplift, lateral bending, or seismic-induced curvatures, and filled with concrete. The shell or pipe  
is usually driven with a removable mandrel. The shell is either a constant section or a tapered  
shape. Steel-encased piles are generally friction piles. The steel shell must have sufficient  
strength to remain watertight and not collapse from ground pressure when the mandrel is  
removed.  
1810.3.2 Materials. Deep foundations of various materials such as concrete, steel, and timber  
are covered in this section including seismic hook requirements. Other relevant issues such as  
protection of materials and allowable stresses is also discussed.  
1810.3.2.1 Concrete. Concrete used for the bulb type of pile must have a zero slump to be stiff  
enough to be compacted by the drop weight. The maximum sized aggregate allowed is ¾ inch to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationallow proper compaction and prevent segregation. To prevent the pull-out of the hoops, spirals,  
and ties in higher seismic areas of SDCs C through F, seismic hoops as defined in ACI 318  
should be used at the end of such hoops, spirals, and ties.  
1810.3.2.2 Prestressing steel. Prestressing steel used in deep foundations must comply with  
ASTM A416 Standard Specification for Low-Relaxation, Seven-Wire Steel Strand for  
Prestressed Concrete. Table 1808.8.1 lists when higher strength concrete is used in prestressed  
piles to reduce volume changes, which reduce prestress losses, and to provide a more dense  
concrete to reduce cover requirements.  
1810.3.2.3 Steel. Structural steel H-piles, sheet piling, steel pipe piles, and fully welded steel  
piles shall conform to the appropriate and applicable ASTM standard referenced in this section  
of the code. H-piles are typically available in ASTM A36 and A572 steel. Pipe piles are  
fabricated from ASTM A252 or A283 plate. ASTM A252 is a specification specifically for  
welded pipe piles. Piles using ASTM A690 and A992 are used in common practice.  
1810.3.2.4 Timber. Timber piles, although not having the high load capacities of steel or  
concrete piles, are the most commonly used type of pile, mainly because of their availability and  
ease of handling. Timber piles are shaped from tree trunks and are tapered because of the natural  
taper of the trunk. Round timber piles are generally made from Southern Pine in lengths up to 80  
feet \(24.38 m\) or Pacific Coast Douglas Fir in lengths up to 120 feet \(36.58 m\). Other species  
that are used are red oak and red pine in lengths up to 60 feet \(18.29 m\).  
Untreated timber piles that are embedded permanently below the ground-water level \(fresh  
water only, not brackish or marine conditions\) may last indefinitely. If embedded above the  
water table, the piles are subject to decay, and if above ground are also subject to insect attack.  
Hence, piles should be preservative treated.  
Timber piles may be either end-bearing or friction piles. ASTM D25 sets forth the minimum  
circumference at the butt and the tip based on pile taper, as well as quality of the wood and  
tolerances on straightness, knots, twist of grain, and other requirements.  
Piles must be pressure treated to prevent decay and insect attack. The IBC references AWPA  
U1 \(Commodity Specification E, Use Category 4C\) for round timber piles and AWPA U1  
\(Commodity Specification A, Use Category 4B\) for sawn timber piles. See also discussion in  
Section 1809.12 for timber footings.  
1810.3.2.5 Protection of materials. Unless properly protected, deep foundation elements may  
deteriorate because of biological, chemical, or physical actions caused by particular conditions  
that exist or that may later develop at the site. The durability of deep foundation elements will be  
long lasting if care is taken in the selection and protection of element materials.  
Some of the problems associated with deep foundation element durability are\:  
• Untreated timber piles may be successfully used if they are entirely embedded in earth  
and their butts \(cutoffs\) are below the lowest ground-water level or are submerged in  
fresh water. The risk, however, is in situations where unexpected lowering of the water  
table occurs and exposes the upper parts of piles to decay and insect attack. Such  
conditions may occur where the water table is significantly lowered by pumping or deep  
drainage. There is also the remote possibility that wood piles will be damaged by the  
percolation of ground water heavily charged with alkali or acids.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation• Wood piles extending above the water table or exposed to air or saltwater are subject to  
decay and attack by insects and marine borers. The piles need to be pressure treated with  
preservatives conforming to the requirements of AWPA U1.  
• Steel piles that are driven and embedded entirely in undisturbed soil are generally not  
significantly affected by corrosion caused by oxidation, regardless of soil types or soil  
properties. The reason for this is that undisturbed soil is so deficient in oxygen at levels  
only a few feet below the ground line or below the water table that progressive corrosion  
is inhibited. However, where upper portions of steel piles protrude above ground into the  
air, where piles are placed in corrosive soils, or where ground water contains deleterious  
substances from sources such as coal piles, alkali soils, active cinder fills, chemical  
wastes from manufacturing operations, or other sources of pollutants, the steel may be  
subject to corrosive action. Under such conditions, steel piles may be protected by a  
concrete encasement or a suitable coating, extending from a level slightly above ground  
to a depth below the layer of disturbed earth. For piles above ground level that are  
exposed to air and subject to rusting, the steel should be protected by being painted, as  
any other type of structural steel construction would be protected.  
• Steel piles installed in saltwater or exposed to a saltwater environment are subject to  
corrosion, and therefore should be protected with approved coatings or encased in  
concrete.  
• Concrete deep elements, plain or reinforced, that are entirely embedded in undisturbed  
earth are generally considered permanent installations. The level of the water table does  
not normally affect the durability of concrete deep elements. Ground water that readily  
flows through either granular materials or disturbed soil and contains deleterious  
substances can have deteriorating effects. Concrete piles embedded in impervious clay  
materials will not generally suffer from ground water containing harmful substances. The  
primary deleterious substances that attack concrete are acids and sulfates. In the case of  
acids, it is best to use an alternative pile material if the acid attack is potentially  
destructive as coating piles may be ineffective because of soil abrasion during driving.  
Concrete can be attacked, however, by exposure to soils with high sulfate content. In the  
case of high alkaline soils with sulfate salts, Type V portland cement may be used. Where  
the exposures are only moderate, a Type II portland cement will usually be adequate. If  
the piles are in a marine environment, Type II or V portland cement is also indicated to  
provide the necessary sulfate resistance.  
The conditions of the underground environment should be ascertained so as to protect deep  
foundation elements against possible corrosion of either the concrete or exposed load-bearing  
steel. Corrosion by oxidation is generally very minor and often disregarded. Corrosion caused by  
electrolytic action or by destructive chemicals on load-bearing steel can be protected by suitable  
coating, concrete encasement, and cathodic protection. This also applies to bare steel piles  
previously discussed. Concrete can be protected from chemical attack by the use of special  
cements, dense concrete mixtures, and special coatings.  
Deep foundation elements installed in saltwater, such as for buildings or other structures in  
waterfront construction, are subject to chemical action on concrete materials coming from  
polluted waters, frost action on porous concrete, spalling of concrete, and rusting of steel  
reinforcement. Spalling may become particularly serious under tidal conditions where alternate  
wetting and drying occurs coupled with cycles of freezing and thawing. Spalling can be  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationminimized or prevented by providing additional cover over the reinforcement; by the use of rich,  
dense concrete; by air entrainment and suitable concrete admixtures; and, in the case of precast  
piles, by careful handling to minimize stresses and avoid cracking during placement. See  
discussion of Chapter 19 and ACI 318 for more detailed information on concrete quality and  
concrete materials.  
1810.3.2.6 Allowable stresses. Allowable stresses for various types of deep foundations have  
been summarized in Table 1810.3.2.6. The allowable stress limits are set to provide an adequate  
margin of safety.  
For precast-prestressed concrete, the term is the same as conventionally reinforced piles.  
Because prestressing places additional compressive stresses on the pile, this stress must be  
subtracted from the allowable compressive stress; hence, the subtractive term –0.27fpc. The term  
fpc is the effective prestress on the gross area, which is the prestressing force remaining after  
losses have occurred.  
For H-piles, the stresses allowed consider stability. Tests have shown that for H-piles driven  
to refusal in rock through soils that provide full lateral support, the stresses at failure can  
approach the yield stress of the material. Hence, higher stresses are allowed if a soil investigation  
and load tests are performed.  
For concrete CIP without a permanent steel casing, pile capacity must be based on concrete  
strength alone without consideration of soil capacity, and the area of the internal cross section of  
the pile, that is, casing inside diameter. The allowable stresses for drilled uncased piles are the  
same as CIP piles for which holes are formed by machine drilling with auger or bucket-type  
drills, with or without temporary casing. Concrete is placed by conventional methods including  
tremies or funnel hoppers. In augered piles, concrete is injected through the hollow stem auger as  
the auger is withdrawn. Reinforcement, if placed without lateral ties, is also placed through ducts  
in the hollow stem auger. Concrete drilled or augered CIP uncased piles have an allowable stress  
limit of 30 percent of the 28-day specified compressive strength \( \) and an allowable  
compressive stress in the reinforcement of 40 percent of the yield strength of the steel \[or 30,000  
psi \(206 MPa\)\]. These limits are consistent with ASCE Standard Guidelines for the Design and  
Installation of Pile Foundations \(ASCE 20\). For steel-cased deep concrete foundation elements,  
the allowable stress is 0.33 as for other concrete piles because the steel shell is too thin to act  
as a composite pile but does act as confinement reinforcement. The allowable stress is 0.40 if  
the shell meets the confinement conditions in Section 1810.3.2.7 or Section 1810.3.5.3.4.  
1810.3.2.7 Increased allowable compressive stress for cased mandrell-driven CIP elements.  
The conditions discussed in Section 1810.3.2.7 and Table 1810.3.2.6 where the allowable  
concrete compressive stress is allowed to be increased consist of six conditions. Note that the  
shell thickness is not considered load carrying, the shell must be seamless or spirally welded, the  
yield strength of steel normally used for the casings is 30 ksi \(206.8 MPa\), and the maximum  
diameter is set so that the volumetric ratio of shell to concrete is sufficient to provide  
confinement for the concrete.  
1810.3.2.8 Justification of higher allowable stresses. In those sections of Chapter 18 that  
specifically deal with the types of elements most commonly used in the construction of deep  
foundations, there are limitations placed on the stresses that can be used in the deep foundation  
element design. In most cases, the allowable stresses are stated as a percentage of some limiting  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstrength property of the deep foundations material. For example, in the case of piles made of  
steel materials, the allowable stresses are prescribed as a percentage of the yield strength of the  
several grades of steel that can be used for pile construction. For concrete, the allowable stress is  
stated as a percentage of compressive strength of the material. The allowable stresses for timber  
piles are based on tabulations of already reduced stresses. The reduced stresses are based on the  
strength values of different species of wood and reductions in strength caused by preservative  
treatment.  
The allowable design stresses designated in Chapter 18 for each of the different types of deep  
foundations are intended to provide a factor of safety against the dynamic forces of deep  
foundation element driving that may cause damage to the element, and to avoid overstresses in  
the element under the design loads and other loads that may be induced by subsoil conditions.  
This section allows the use of higher allowable stresses when evidence supporting the values  
is submitted and approved by the building official. The data submitted to the building official  
should include analytical evaluations and findings from a foundation investigation as specified in  
Section 1803, and the results of load tests performed in accordance with the requirements of  
Section 1810.3.3.1.2. The technical data and the recommendation for the use of higher stress  
values must come from a registered design professional that is knowledgeable in soil mechanics  
and experienced in the design of deep foundations. This registered design professional must  
supervise the deep foundation design work and witness the installation of the deep foundation so  
as to certify to the building official that the construction satisfies the design criteria. In any case,  
the use of greater design stresses should not result in design loads that are larger than one-half of  
the ultimate axial load capacity \(see Section 1810.3.3.1.2\).  
1810.3.3 Determination of allowable loads. The IBC specifies that the determination of  
allowable loads shall be based on one of three methods\:  
1\. An approved driving formula  
2\. Load tests  
3\. Foundation analysis  
In most cases, the allowable loads will be determined by a combination of Items 2 and 3.  
However, there may be circumstances where the soil conditions, such as granular soils, and the  
type of deep foundation selected are such that the use of an approved dynamic deep foundation  
driving formula can be an aid to a qualified practitioner in establishing reasonable but safe  
allowable loads for the foundation system.  
There are two general considerations for determining capacity as required for the design and  
installation of deep foundations. The first consideration involves the determination of the  
underlying soil or rock characteristics. The second is the application of approved driving  
formulas, load tests, or accepted methods of analysis to determine the pile capacities required to  
resist the applied axial and lateral loads, as well as to provide the basis for the proper selection of  
pile-driving equipment.  
Allowable axial load determination is further addressed in Sections 1810.3.3.1.1 through  
1810.3.3.1.9.  
1810.3.3.1.1 Driving criteria. Deep foundation elements must be of a size, strength, and  
stiffness capable of resisting without damage\:  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation• Crushing caused by impact forces during driving.  
• Bending stresses during handling.  
• Tension from uplift forces or from rebound during driving.  
• Bending stresses caused by horizontal forces during driving.  
• Bending stresses caused by deep element curvatures.  
Additionally, the deep element must be capable of transmitting dynamic driving forces to  
mobilize the required ultimate deep element capacity within the soil without severe elastic  
energy losses. Driveability depends on the deep element stiffness, which is a function of deep  
element length, cross-sectional area, and modulus of elasticity. Yield strength does not affect  
stiffness. Thus, caution should be observed in the use of high-yield-strength steels for high loads  
on smaller cross sections requiring high dynamic driving energy. For allowable loads greater  
than 40 tons \(356 kN\), a wave equation method of analysis reflects deep element stiffness or  
driveability. The selection of deep foundation types and dimensional requirements for  
driveability is a function of soil characteristics.  
This section limits the allowable compression load on a deep foundation element as  
established by an approved driving formula to a maximum of 40 tons \(356 kN\). Generally, the  
use of pile-driving formulas to determine pile capacity should be avoided except, perhaps, in  
cases involving small jobs where the piles are to be driven in well-drained granular soils and load  
testing cannot be economically justified.  
1810.3.3.1.2 Load tests. This section specifies the standards to be used to load test deep  
foundation elements, where higher compressive loads than allowed in other sections of the code  
are exceeded or where CIP deep foundation elements have an enlarged base formed either by  
compacting concrete or by driving a precast base. See the discussion under Section 1810.3.3.1.3  
for test evaluation methods.  
Many standards, including ASTM D4945, indicate that a dynamic test may not be sufficient  
without a static test \(ASTM D1143\) to calibrate the results, but leave it up to the registered  
design professional to decide if the dynamic test is sufficient. Other standards require a static  
load test to calibrate the dynamic test.  
The safest method for determining deep foundation element capacity is by load test. The load-  
bearing capacity of enlarged base piles is specifically required to be determined from load tests.  
A load test should be conducted wherever feasible and used where the deep foundation element  
capacity is intended to exceed 40 tons \(356 kN\) per element \(see Section 1810.3.3.1.1\). Test  
deep elements are to be of the same type and size as intended for use in the permanent  
foundation and installed with the same equipment, by the same procedure, and in the same soils  
intended or specified for the work.  
Load tests are to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of ASTM D1143, which  
covers procedures for testing vertical or batter foundation piles, individually or in groups, to  
determine the ultimate pile load \(pile capacity\) and whether the pile or pile group is capable of  
supporting the loads without excessive or continuous settlement. Recognition, however, must be  
given to the fact that load-settlement characteristics and pile capacity determinations are based  
on data derived at the time and under the conditions of the test. The long-term performance of a  
pile or group of piles supporting actual loads may produce behaviors that are different than those  
indicated by load test results. Judgment based on experience must be used to predict pile capacity  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand expected behavior.  
The load-bearing capacity of all deep foundation elements, except those seated on rock, does  
not reach the ultimate load until after a period of rest. The results of load tests cannot be deemed  
accurate or reliable unless there is an allowance for a period of adjustment. For piles driven in  
permeable soils such as coarse-grained sand and gravel, the waiting period may be as little as  
two or three days. For test piles driven in silt, clay, or fine sand, the waiting period may be 30  
days or longer. The waiting period may be determined by testing \(i.e., by redriving piles\) or from  
previous experience.  
This section also requires that at least one deep foundation element be tested in each area of  
uniform subsoil conditions. The statement should not be misconstrued to mean that the area of  
test is to have only one uniform stratum of subsurface material, but rather that the soil profile,  
which may consist of several layers \(strata\) of different materials, must represent a substantially  
unchanging cross section in each area to be tested.  
The allowable deep foundation element load to be used for design purposes is not to be more  
than one-half of the ultimate deep element capacity. The rate of penetration of permanent deep  
foundation elements must be equal to or less than that of the test element\(s\).  
All production deep foundation elements should be of the same type, size, and approximate  
length as the prototype test elements, as well as installed with the same or comparable equipment  
and methods. They should also be installed in soils similar to those of the test element.  
1810.3.3.1.3 Load test evaluation methods. Three specific methods are given that are  
acceptable for evaluating deep foundation load tests. Other methods are permitted at the  
discretion of the building official.  
1810.3.3.1.4 Allowable shaft resistance. Resistance that is due to skin friction is limited to one-  
sixth of the bearing value of the soil material at minimum depth as set forth in Table 1806.2, up  
to a maximum of 500 psf \(24 kPa\) unless a greater value is permitted by the building official  
based on recommendations of an approved geotechnical investigation or a greater value is  
substantiated by load test methods described in Section 1810.3.3.1.2.  
1810.3.3.1.5 Uplift capacity of a single deep foundation element. This section gives both the  
designer and building official needed guidance on criteria to use for design of a single deep  
foundation element for uplift. The IBC requires an approved method of analysis with a safety  
factor of 3 or a test in accordance with ASTM D3689. The maximum allowable uplift load  
cannot exceed the ultimate load capacity determined by the methods described in Section  
1810.3.3.1.2 divided by a factor of safety of two.  
When deep foundation elements are designed to withstand uplift forces, they act in tension  
and are actually friction elements. The amount of tension that can be developed not only depends  
on the strength properties of the element, but also on the frictional or cohesive properties of the  
soil. The uplift or tensile resistance of a deep element is not necessarily a function of its load-  
bearing capacity under compressive load. For example, the tensile resistance of a friction pile in  
clay will usually be about the same value as its load-bearing capacity, as the skin friction  
developed in such soils is very large. In contrast, a friction pile in sand or in other granular  
materials will develop a tensile resistance considerably less than its load-bearing capacity.  
Where the properties of the soil are known, the ultimate uplift resistance value of a pile can be  
determined by approved analytical methods. This section requires that where the ultimate tensile  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationvalue is determined by analysis, a safety factor of 3 must be applied to establish the allowable  
uplift load of the deep foundation element.  
The best way to determine the response of a vertical or batter pile to a static tensile load  
\(uplift force\) applied axially to the pile is by applying an extraction test in accordance with the  
requirements of ASTM D3689. The maximum allowable uplift load is not to be more than one-  
half of the total test load. This section of the code gives a limitation on the upward movement of  
the pile in compliance with the provisions of the ASTM D3689 test method. The measurements  
of pile movement in the standard test procedure, however, are time-dependent incremental  
measurements and should be adhered to in determining allowable pile load.  
To be effective in resisting uplift forces as tension members of a foundation system, deep  
foundation elements must be well anchored into the cap by adequate connection devices. In turn,  
the cap must be designed for the uplift stresses. Deep foundation elements must also be designed  
to take the tensile stresses imposed by the uplift forces. For example, concrete piles must be  
reinforced with longitudinal steel to take the full net uplift. Special consideration needs to be  
given in the design of pile splices that are intended to act in tension. When design uplift is due to  
wind or seismic loading, the factor of safety for the analytical method requires a factor of safety  
of 2 while the load test method requires a factor of safety of 1.5.  
1810.3.3.1.6 Allowable uplift load of grouped deep foundation elements. The allowable uplift  
load on a group of deep foundation elements may need to be reduced from the value obtained on  
a single element as described in Section 1810.3.3.1.5 of the code and in compliance with  
comprehensive analytical methods. The capacity of deep foundation groups is limited to two-  
thirds of the weight of the group and the soil contained in the group plus two-thirds of the  
ultimate shear resistance along the soil block. This is consistent with requirements in other  
sections in the code on uplift and overturning, where the dead load resistance is limited to two-  
thirds of the weight. The IBC allows the use of two-thirds of the effective weight of the pile  
group, two-thirds of the weight of the soil contained within a block defined by the perimeter of  
the group and the length of the piles, plus two-thirds of the ultimate shear resistance along the  
soil block. Where the center-to-center spacing of deep foundation elements is at least three times  
the least horizontal dimension of the largest single element, the allowable working uplift load for  
the group must be calculated by an approved method of analysis.  
1810.3.3.1.7 Load-bearing capacity. The load-bearing capacity of a deep foundation element is  
determined as a deep element–soil system. For example, the load-bearing capacity of a single  
pile is the function of either the structural strength of the pile or the supporting strength of the  
soil. The load-bearing capacity of the deep foundation element is controlled by the smaller value  
obtained in the two considerations. The load-bearing capacity of a deep element group may be  
greater than, equal to, or less than the capacity of a single element multiplied by the number of  
elements in the group, depending on deep element spacing and soil conditions.  
Because the supporting strength of the soil generally controls the load-bearing capacity of a  
deep foundation element, this section requires that the ultimate load-bearing capacity of an  
individual element or a group of elements be at least twice the design load capacity of the  
supporting load-bearing strata.  
Sometimes, weaker layers of soil underlie the soil load-bearing strata supporting a pile  
foundation and may cause damaging settlements. Under such subsurface conditions, it must be  
determined by an approved method of analysis that the safety factor has not been reduced to less  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthan 2. Otherwise, the piles are to be driven to deeper load-bearing soils to obtain adequate and  
safe support, or the design capacity is to be reduced and the number of piles increased.  
1810.3.3.1.8 Bent deep foundation elements. Deep foundation elements that are discovered to  
have sharp or sweeping bends because of obstructions encountered during the driving operations  
or for any other cause are to be analyzed by an approved method, or a representative deep  
element is to be load tested to determine its load-carrying capacity. Otherwise, the deep  
foundation elements could be used at some reduced capacity as determined by test or analysis;  
or, if necessary, they can be abandoned and replaced.  
1810.3.3.1.9 Helical piles. Helical piles are comprised of a steel shaft and steel bearing plates,  
also known as helices or cutters that are driven into the ground. The IBC requires that six  
specific items be checked in order to determine the allowable capacity of the helical piles. The  
designer must first determine the “base capacity” of the helical pile which considers the bearing  
capacity of the combined bearing plates and the skin friction against the steel shaft. Figure 1810-  
2 depicts how the applied load on a helical pile is resisted by the skin friction on the shaft in  
addition to the combined bearing capacity of the helical plates.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 1810-2 How helical piles resist applied loads.  
In addition to the base capacity of the pile, the ultimate capacity must be checked in relation  
to load test data and historical data based on installation torque. The ultimate capacity of the steel  
shaft, shaft couplings, and sum of the steel bearing plates must also be considered. In the end, the  
least value controls the ultimate axial capacity of the pile and the allowable load to the piles must  
not exceed one-half of the calculated ultimate capacity.  
1810.3.3.2 Allowable lateral load. Because of wind loads, unbalanced building loads, earth  
pressures, and seismic loads, it is inevitable that individual deep foundation elements or groups  
of vertical elements supporting buildings or other structures will be subjected to lateral forces.  
The distribution of these lateral forces to the deep elements largely depends on how the loads are  
carried down through the structural framing system and transferred through the supporting  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfoundation to the deep foundation elements. The amount of lateral load that can be taken by the  
deep foundation element is a function of \(1\) the type of deep foundation element used; \(2\) the  
soil characteristics, particularly in the upper 10 to 30 feet \(3,048 to 9,144 mm\) of the deep  
foundation element; \(3\) the embedment of the deep foundation element head \(fixity\); \(4\) the  
magnitude of the axial compressive load on the deep foundation element; \(5\) the nature of the  
lateral forces; and \(6\) the amount of horizontal deep foundation element movement deemed  
acceptable.  
The degree of fixity of the deep foundation element head is an important design consideration  
under very high lateral loading unless some other method, such as the use of batter piles, is  
employed to resist lateral loads. The fixing of the deep foundation element head against rotation  
reduces the lateral deflection. In general, pile butts are embedded 3 to 4 inches \(76 to 102 mm\)  
into the pile cap \(see Section 1810.3.11\) with no ties to the cap. These pile heads are neither  
fixed nor free, but somewhere in between. Such construction is satisfactory for many loading  
conditions, but not for high seismic loads.  
The magnitude of friction developed between the surfaces of two structural elements in  
contact with each other is a function of the weight or load applied. The larger the weight, the  
greater the frictional resistance developed. In the design of deep foundation elements, frictional  
resistance between the soil and the bottom of the deep element caps \(footings\) should not be  
relied on to provide lateral restraint, because the vertical loads are transmitted through the deep  
foundation elements to the supporting soil below and to the ground immediately under the deep  
element caps. Only the weights of the caps can supply some frictional resistance insofar as such  
footings are constructed by placing fresh concrete on the soil, thus providing a positive contact.  
The weight of the caps in comparison to the magnitude of loads and lateral forces transmitted to  
the deep foundation elements is nominal and not significant from a structural design standpoint.  
Also, in rare occurrences, soils have been known to settle under caps, leaving open spaces and  
thus eliminating the development of any frictional restraint.  
Where vertical deep elements are subjected to lateral forces exceeding acceptable limitations,  
the use of batter piles may be required. Lateral forces on many structures are also resisted by the  
embedded foundation walls and the sides of the deep foundation element caps.  
The allowable lateral-load capacity of a single deep foundation element or group of such  
elements is to be determined either by approved analytical methods or by load tests. Load tests  
are to be conducted to produce lateral forces that are twice the proposed design load; however, in  
no case is the allowable deep foundation element load to exceed one-half of the test load, which  
produces a gross lateral element movement of 1 inch \(25.4 mm\) as measured at the ground  
surface or the top of foundation element, whichever is lower. This criterion can be exceeded if it  
can be shown that the predicted lateral movement will not cause any harmful distortion of or  
instability in the structure and that no element will be loaded beyond its capacity.  
1810.3.4 Subsiding soils or strata. Where deep foundation elements are driven through  
subsiding soils or strata and derive their support from underlying firmer materials, the subsiding  
soils or strata cause an additional load to the deep foundation elements through so-called  
negative friction. This negative friction is actually a downward friction force on the deep  
foundation elements, which increases the axial load on such elements. The code permits an  
increase in the allowable stress on the deep foundation elements if an analysis of the geotechnical  
investigation indicates that the increase is justified.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1810.3.5 Dimensions of deep foundation elements. Deep foundation elements must have  
minimum dimensions as described in Sections 1810.3.5.1 through 1810.3.5.3 for precast, CIP  
cased, and CIP uncased deep foundations.  
1810.3.5.1 Precast. Eight inches \(203 mm\) is the minimum practical lateral dimension to  
accommodate reinforcement.  
1810.3.5.2 Cast-in-place or grouted-in-place. Eight inches \(203 mm\) is the minimum practical  
nominal outside diameter to accommodate reinforcement for cased CIP deep foundation  
elements. For uncased CIP deep foundation elements, the minimum 12-inch \(305 mm\) diameter  
is for inspection purposes. The length-to-diameter ratio limit of 30 is based on construction and  
stability considerations but may be exceeded if a registered design professional supervises design  
and installation.  
1810.3.5.2.3 Micropiles. A micropile is defined as a bored, grouted-in-place deep foundation  
element that develops its load-carrying capacity by means of a bond zone in soil, bedrock, or a  
combination of soil and bedrock. The maximum outside diameter of a micropile is 12 inches  
\(305 mm\).  
1810.3.5.3 Steel. Steel deep foundation elements are generally H-piles, piles fabricated from  
welded plates, sheet piling, steel pipes and tubes, and helical piles.  
1810.3.5.3.1 Structural steel H-piles. H-piles are usually used as deep end-bearing piles  
because they are essentially nondisplacement-type piles that can readily penetrate solid strata to  
reach rock or other suitable hard-bearing strata such as dense gravels. Ideally, steel H-piles are  
driven to hard or medium hard rock.  
H-piles are proportioned to withstand the impact stresses from hard driving. The flange and  
web thicknesses are usually equal. The flange widths are proportioned such that the section  
modulus, Sy, in the weak axis is approximately one-third of the strong axis section modulus, Sx.  
H-piles in SDC D-F must be designed and detailed in accordance with AISC 341.  
1810.3.5.3.2 Fully welded steel piles fabricated from plates. Although they are in a separate  
section, the requirements for steel piles fabricated from welded plates are the same as for steel H-  
piles except for the high seismic detailing requirements.  
1810.3.5.3.3 Structural steel sheet piling. Provisions for structural steel sheet piling require that  
the profiles conform to manufacturer’s specifications and the general requirements in ASTM A6.  
1810.3.5.3.4 Steel pipes and tubes. Driven pipe piles are displacement-type piles if driven  
closed, and are nondisplacement-type piles if driven open. Pipe piles are made of seamless or  
welded pipes and are frequently filled with concrete after driving. Pipe piles conforming to  
ASTM A252 are used in both friction and end-bearing applications. Pipe piles may be driven  
open ended or closed ended. Open-ended pipe piles are generally used when the geotechnical  
investigation shows rock or a suitable end-bearing stratum close to the ground surface, especially  
if the loads to be supported are large. The pipe is driven to bearing, the soils forced into the pipe  
during driving are cleaned out, and the pipe is filled with concrete. Closed-end piles are generally  
used as friction piles when a suitable bearing stratum is not available at suitable depths. There are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationseveral proprietary closed-end pipe piles available.  
When steel pipes are driven open ended, minimum thickness to diameter is related to hammer  
energy by requiring a minimum area per kip-foot of energy. Open-ended pipes require a  
minimum area of 0.34 square inch \(219 mm2\) to resist each 1,000 ft-lb \(1,356 Nm\). This  
requirement equates to a wall thickness of 0.27 inch \(6.86 mm\) for a 10-inch \(254 mm\) pipe  
driven with a hammer energy of 25 kip-feet \(33.9 kN-m\). Note that if the wall thickness is less  
than 0.179 inch \(4.55 mm\), a driving shoe is required to prevent local buckling at the tip from  
hard driving, regardless of diameter or hammer energy. The 0.179-inch \(4.55 mm\) thickness is  
consistent with the most common minimum thickness for closed-end pipe piles.  
Concrete-filled steel pipes or tubes in structures assigned to SDC C, D, E, or F shall have a  
wall thickness of not less than 3/16 inch \(4.76 mm\). The pipe or tube casing for socketed drilled  
shafts shall have a nominal outside diameter of not less than 18 inches \(457 mm\) and a wall  
thickness of not less than ⅜ inch \(9.5 mm\). The pipe is a welded or seamless pipe conforming to  
ASTM A252. ASCE 20 as well as the recommendations of the Driven Pile Committee of the  
Deep Foundations Institute list 0.179 inches \(4.55 mm\) as the minimum wall thickness.  
Concrete-filled steel piles are either seamless or welded pipe, or closed-end tubular piles with  
either straight or tapered sections that are driven into the soil. The piles may be installed as either  
friction or end-bearing piles. This pile type is characterized by a steel shell that is thicker than the  
thin shell used in some steel-cased piles, hence both the concrete and steel shell are assumed to  
carry load compositely. If driven open ended, the earth core is removed from the shell prior to  
concreting. The shell may be driven with an internal mandrel in which case the minimum wall  
thickness is 1/10 inch \(2.54 mm\).  
1810.3.5.3.5 Helical piles. See Section 1810.3.3.1.9.  
1810.3.6 Splices. This section specifies the requirements for splicing of deep foundation  
elements. The 50-percent requirement provides more strength where the bending moments are  
low, insofar as it is based on the capacity of the deep foundation element, not the design loads.  
Splices of deep foundation elements of different materials or types are required to develop the  
full compressive strength and not less than 50 percent of the tension and bending strength of the  
weaker section. An exception for buildings in SDC A or B is provided, noting that splices do not  
need to comply with the 50 percent provision where justified by supporting data.  
Although it is physically and economically better to drive piles in one piece, site conditions  
sometimes necessitate that piles be driven in spliced sections. For example, when the soil or  
rock-bearing stratum is located so deep below the ground that the leads on the driving equipment  
will not receive full-length piles, it becomes necessary to install the piles in sections or, where  
possible, to take up the extra length by setting the tip in a preexcavated hole \(see discussion,  
Section 1810.4.4\). When piles are installed in areas such as existing buildings with restricted  
headroom, they are also required to be placed in spliced sections. There are a number of other  
reasons for field-splicing piles, such as restrictions on shipping lengths or the use of composite  
piles.  
This provision requires that splices be constructed to provide and maintain true alignment and  
position of the deep foundation element sections during installation. Splices must be of sufficient  
strength to transmit the vertical and lateral loads on the deep foundation elements, as well as to  
resist the bending stresses that may occur at splice locations during the driving operations and  
under long-term service loads. Splices are to develop at least 50 percent of the value of the deep  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfoundation element in bending. Consideration should be given to the design of splices at  
locations where the deep foundation elements may be subject to tension. Splices that occur in the  
upper 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) of pile embedment are to be designed to resist the bending moments  
and shears at the allowable stress levels of the pile material, based on an assumed pile load  
eccentricity of 3 inches \(76 mm\), unless the pile is properly braced. Proper bracing of a spliced  
pile is deemed to exist if stability of the pile group is furnished in accordance with the provisions  
of Section 18.10.2.2, provided that other piles in the group do not have splices in the upper 10  
feet \(3,048 mm\) of their embedded length.  
There are different methods employed in splicing deep foundation elements depending on the  
materials used in the deep element construction. For example, timber piles are spliced by one of  
two commonly used methods. The first method uses a pipe sleeve with a length of about four to  
five times the diameter of the pile. The butting ends of the pile are sawn square for full contact of  
the two pile sections, and the spliced portions of the timber pile are trimmed smoothly around  
their periphery to fit tightly into the pipe sleeve. The second splicing method involves the use of  
steel straps and bolts. The butting ends of the pile sections are sawn square for full contact and  
proper alignment, and the four sides are planed flat to receive the splicing straps. This type of  
splicing can resist some uplift forces.  
Splicing of precast concrete piles usually occurs at the head portions of the piles. After the  
piles are driven to their required depth, pile heads are cut off or spliced to the desired elevation  
for proper embedment in the concrete pile caps. Any portion of the pile that is cracked or  
shattered by the driving operations or cutting off of pile heads should be removed and spliced  
with fresh concrete. To cut off a precast concrete pile section, a deep groove is chiseled around  
the pile exposing the reinforcing bars, which are then cut off \(by torch\) to desired heights or  
extensions. The pile section above the groove is snapped off \(by crane\) and a new pile section is  
freshly cast to tie in with the precast pile.  
Steel H-piles are spliced in the same manner as steel columns, usually by welding the sections  
together. Welded splices may be welded-plate or bar splices, butt-welded splices, special welded  
splice fittings, or a combination of these. Spliced materials should be kept on the inner faces of  
the H-pile sections to avoid forcing a hole in the ground larger than the pile, causing at least a  
temporary loss in frictional value and lateral support that might result in excessive bending  
stresses.  
Steel pipe piles may be spliced by butt welding, sometimes using straps to guide the sections  
and to provide more strength to the welded joint. Another method is to use inside sleeves having  
a driving fit, with a flange extending between the pipe sections. By applying bituminous cement  
or compound on the outside of the ring before driving, a water-tight joint is obtained.  
1810.3.6.1 Seismic design categories C through F. Splices of deep foundation elements in  
SDCs C through F are addressed in this section and require that the splices develop the lesser of  
two elements\: \(1\) the nominal strength of the deep foundation element and \(2\) the axial and shear  
forces and moments from the seismic load combinations including overstrength factor of ASCE  
7, Sections 2.3.6 or 2.4.5. For a discussion of overstrength factor, see Section 1810.3.11.2.  
1810.3.7 Top of element detailing at cutoffs. The requirements of this section are intended to  
account for conditions where a deep foundation element encounters refusal at a shallower depth  
than anticipated and a portion of the deep element is cut off. It is imperative that the required  
reinforcement be provided at the top of the deep foundation element when the excess deep  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationelement length is cut off.  
1810.3.8 Precast concrete piles. Precast concrete piles are manufactured as conventionally  
reinforced concrete or as prestressed concrete. Both types can be formed by bed casting,  
centrifugal casting, slipforming, or extrusion methods. Piles are usually square, octagonal, or  
round, and either solid or hollow. Precast piles, which may be either friction or end-bearing piles,  
are of the displacement type and are driven into place.  
Design and detailing requirements for precast piles are referenced to ACI 318 with two  
exceptions. These exceptions allow the use of the ASCE 7 overstrength factor by applying the  
factor to the load equations with seismic loads included to replace a design following ACI 318.  
These provisions were not included in ACI 318-19 and thus remain in the IBC. Exceptions 1 and  
2 recognize that the volumetric ratio of spiral reinforcement need not be greater than that  
required for driving and handling stresses when a pile foundation system is designed for load  
combinations including overstrength. The minimum spiral reinforcement required per ACI 318,  
Section 13.4.5.6 for driving and handling stresses is the minimum spiral reinforcement required  
in SDCs A and B. Increased axial forces, shear forces, and bending moments provide a large  
factor of safety against nonlinear pile behavior when the design includes overstrength effects.  
1810.3.9 Cast-in-place deep foundations. CIP deep foundations are covered in Sections  
1810.3.9.1 through 1810.3.9.6. CIP concrete piles are installed by placing concrete into holes  
preformed by drilling or by driving a temporary or permanent casing to the required bearing  
depth. Drilled or augered piles are also known as cast-in-drill-hole or CIDH piles. Drilled or  
augured uncased piles are nondisplacement piles and are installed by drilling or augering a hole  
and filling the uncased hole with concrete, either during or after withdrawing the auger. CIP piles  
may be either cased or uncased. Uncased piles are difficult to construct when below the ground-  
water table. Except for enlarged base piles, the concrete in CIP piles is not subjected to driving  
forces, only the forces imposed by the service loads and downdrag from settlement. One  
advantage of drilled CIP piles is that the tip elevation can easily be adjusted to have the tip on the  
correct bearing stratum. Reinforcement is installed during the concreting operation. CIP-drilled  
piles are of the nondisplacement type, that is, the soil is not displaced or compacted by the  
drilling operation. CIP piles constructed by first driving a closed-end shell are displacement  
piles, where the soil surrounding the shell is displaced and compacted during the driving  
operation. CIP piles constructed by driving an open-ended casing without a mandrel or  
temporary tip closure are nominally a nondisplacement pile, although some compaction around  
the shell may occur in cohesive soils, and densification may occur from driving in granular soils.  
The steel-cased pile is the most widely used type of CIP concrete pile. This pile type is  
characterized by a thin steel shell and is a displacement pile. This pile type consists of a closed-  
end light-gauge steel shell or a thin-walled pipe driven into the soil and left permanently in place,  
reinforced when required for uplift, lateral bending, or seismic-induced curvatures, and filled  
with concrete. The shell or pipe is usually driven with a removable mandrel. The shell is either a  
constant section or a tapered shape. Steel-encased piles are generally friction piles.  
1810.3.9.1 Design cracking moment. The design cracking moment that is established as  
nominal moment capacity multiplied by the factor is determined from the equation  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe equation and the reinforcement requirements of Section 1810.3.9.2 make the IBC  
consistent with ACI 318 requirements. For both uncased and cased CIP deep foundation  
elements \(but not concrete-filled pipes and tubes\), reinforcement must be provided where  
moments exceed a reasonable lower bound for the capacity of the plain concrete section, known  
as the cracking moment.  
1810.3.9.2 Required reinforcement. See Section 1810.3.9.1.  
1810.3.9.3 Placement of reinforcement. With three exceptions, reinforcing steel must be  
assembled into a cage and placed in the hole or casing prior to concreting, not stabbed after  
concreting. One exception is for dowels less than 5 feet \(1,524 mm\) in length, and the other  
exception is for auger-injected piles, which are placed by injecting the concrete through a hollow  
stem auger. The third exception is for smaller residential and utility buildings \(Group R-3 and U  
occupancies\) where the method of reinforcement placement after concrete placement must be  
approved by the building official.  
1810.3.9.4 Seismic reinforcement. There are four specific cases where prescriptive provisions  
are provided to comply with the seismic reinforcement requirements in SDCs C through F. Other  
than these four exceptions, CIP deep foundations must comply with Section 1810.3.9.4.1 for  
seismic reinforcement in SDC C and Section 1810.3.9.4.2 for seismic reinforcement in SDCs D,  
E, and F.  
1810.3.9.4.1 Seismic reinforcement in seismic design category C. Minimum steel  
requirements are established to provide some ductility. The minimum reinforcement must be  
continued throughout the flexural length of the pile. Minimum reinforced length is not a defined  
term in the IBC; rather, in this section there are four criteria to determine the length.  
1810.3.9.4.2 Seismic reinforcement in seismic design categories D through F. The  
requirements in SDC D, E, or F are similar to those in SDC C, except that the minimum  
reinforcement ratio is higher and extends over a longer length to improve ductility. In addition,  
closed ties or spirals are required to provide confinement in regions of plastic hinging, that is, at  
the pile-cap interface, at the interface of soft to stiff layers, and in liquefaction zones.  
Confinement reinforcing should also be used for bay muds and sensitive clays \(see Sections  
1803.5.11 and 1803.5.12\).  
1810.3.9.4.2.1 Site classes A through D. Transverse confinement reinforcement requirements  
for stiffer soil and rock sites are in this section, which references applicable provisions in ACI  
318.  
1810.3.9.4.2.2 Site classes E and F. Transverse confinement reinforcement requirements for soft  
or sensitive soil sites are in this section, which references applicable provisions in ACI 318.  
1810.3.9.5 Belled drilled shafts. Bells are designed to increase the bearing surface on which the  
loads will be transferred. Bells are typically designed in more cohesive soils so that there will not  
be any collapsing of the bell walls or roof.  
1810.3.9.6 Socketed drilled shafts. Socketed drilled shaft deep foundations are also called  
caisson piles or are more commonly known as drilled-in caissons. They are installed as a special  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationtype of high-load-capacity pile and are characterized by a structural steel core, an upper-cased  
section extending to bedrock, and a lower uncased tip that is socketed into rock.  
The socketed drilled shaft deep foundation element is a cased CIP concrete pile that is formed  
by \(1\) driving a heavy-wall open-ended pipe down to bedrock, \(2\) cleaning out the soil materials  
within the pipe, \(3\) drilling an uncased socket into the bedrock, \(4\) inserting a structural steel  
core into the pipe, and \(5\) filling the entire pipe and drilled socket with concrete.  
The core material is usually made of hot-rolled structural steel wide-flange or I-beam  
sections, or steel rails. This section specifies that the steel core is to extend full length from the  
base of the drilled socket to the top of the steel pipe or, as an alternative and depending on design  
requirements, the steel core may extend halfway up the pipe or as a stub core to a distance in the  
pipe at least equal to the depth of the socket. The strength of the deep foundation element is  
developed in combined friction and end-bearing of the rock socket.  
1810.3.10 Micropiles. Micropiles are bored, grouted-in-place deep foundation elements that  
develop their load-carrying capacity by means of a bond zone in soil, bedrock, or a combination  
of soil and bedrock. The IBC provisions are based primarily on the Massachusetts Building Code  
\(MBC\) with additional changes and modifications. Both IBC and MBC provisions have their  
basis in recommendations of the ADSC/DFI \(International Association of Foundation  
Drilling/Deep Foundations Institute\) Committee on Micropiles, and are intended to provide a  
uniform standard for micropiles, and eliminate inconsistencies in their design and installation.  
1810.3.11 Pile caps. Pile caps are to be of reinforced concrete and designed in accordance with  
the requirements of ACI 318. For footings \(pile caps\) on piles, computations for moments and  
shears may be based on the assumption that the load reaction from any pile is concentrated at the  
pile center. See ACI 318 for loads and reactions of footings on piles.  
The soil immediately under the pile cap should not be considered to provide any support for  
vertical loads. For a more detailed explanation of this requirement, see the discussion of Section  
1810.3.3.2, allowable lateral load.  
The heads of all piles are to be embedded not less than 3 inches \(76 mm\) into pile caps, and  
the edges of the pile caps are to extend at least 4 inches \(102 mm\) beyond the closest sides of all  
piles. The degree of fixity between a pile head and the concrete cap depends on the method of  
connection required to satisfy design considerations.  
1810.3.11.1 Seismic design categories C through F. Deep foundation elements in SDCs C  
through F must have a positive connection to the pile cap for sliding or uplift purposes. This is  
achieved by connecting the deep foundation element to the pile cap either by embedding the  
deep element reinforcement in the pile cap or by field-placed dowels anchored into the element  
and extended into the pile cap in accordance with ACI 318.  
Piles in structures subject to seismic ground shaking are likely to be subjected to uplift  
\(tension\) forces, either by design or because of insufficient resistance to overturning forces by  
gravity loads. Hence, concrete piles and concrete-filled steel pipe piles must be able to develop  
the strength of the pile \(in tension\) in the connection to the cap. This is accomplished by the  
requirement that the pile be embedded in the cap at least two times the cap embedment length,  
but not less than the reinforcement tension development length.  
Similarly, the various types of steel piles are required to develop the strength in tension and to  
transmit this strength to the cap by positive means other than bond to the bare steel; for example,  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwelded studs or welded reinforcement must be used.  
Splices must develop the full strength of the pile, both tension and compression, for all pile  
types.  
1810.3.11.2 Seismic design categories D through F. Anchorage of piles or piers into pile caps  
must consider the combined effects of uplift and pile fixity. The anchorage must develop at least  
25 percent of the strength of the pile in tension. For piles subject to uplift or required to provide  
rotational restraint, the anchorage must develop the lesser of the nominal tensile strength of the  
longitudinal reinforcement in a concrete element, the nominal tensile strength of a steel element,  
and 1.3 times the frictional force developed between the element and the soil. Because of the  
large variability in soils, it would be prudent to design these piles for the full tensile capacity  
rather than 1.3 times the uplift capacity \(frictional force\). Exceptions allow the use of ASCE 7  
Section 2.3.6 or 2.4.5 for design of the anchorage to resist axial tension forces or, in the case of  
rotational restraint, the design of the anchorage to resist axial and shear forces, and moments.  
Steel piles used in higher SDCs are expected to yield just under the pile cap or foundation  
because of combined bending and axial loads. AISC 341 design and detailing requirements for  
piles are intended to produce a stable plastic hinge formation in steel piles. ACI 318 provisions  
are similarly intended to produce stable plastic hinges in concrete piles. Because piles can be  
subjected to tension caused by an overturning moment, mechanical means to transfer such  
tension must be designed for the required tension force, but not less than 10 percent of the pile  
compression capacity.  
The load combinations with overstrength only apply where specifically required by the  
seismic provisions. They constitute an additional requirement that must be considered in the  
design of specific structural elements to account for the maximum earthquake load effect, Em,  
which considers “system overstrength.  
” This system characteristic is accounted for by  
multiplying the effects of the lateral earthquake load by the overstrength factor, Ω0, for the  
seismic-force-resisting system involved. It represents the upper bound system strength for  
purposes of designing nonyielding elements for the maximum expected load. Under the design  
earthquake ground motions, the forces generated in the seismic-force-resisting system can be  
much greater than the prescribed seismic design forces. If not accounted for, the system  
overstrength effect can cause failures of structural elements that are subjected to these forces.  
Because system overstrength is unavoidable, design for the maximum earthquake force that can  
be developed is warranted for certain elements. The intent is to provide key elements with  
sufficient overstrength so that inelastic \(ductile\) response/behavior appropriately occurs within  
the vertical resisting elements. It should be noted that these load combinations are only to be  
applied where specified in the earthquake load provisions or in other structural chapters of the  
code. The requirement for using load combinations with overstrength in Section 1810.3.11.2 is  
such a case.  
Batter piles have performed poorly in past earthquakes. This is because the batter piles are  
laterally stiff relative to vertical piles and resist most of the seismic-induced inertial forces. The  
piles are not usually designed to resist the actual forces, but are designed to resist an inertial  
force reduced by an assumed ductility. However, the batter piles are axially stiff and generally  
not detailed for ductility; hence the failures. To preclude this type of failure in batter piles, the  
piles and their connections must be designed to resist the anticipated maximum earthquake  
forces from the load combinations with overstrength factor in Section 2.3.6 or 2.4.5 of ASCE 7.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1810.3.12 Grade beams. In high seismic regions, grade beams must be designed as ductile in  
accordance with the provisions of ACI 318 unless the beam is strong enough to resist the  
anticipated maximum earthquake force as set forth in the load combination with overstrength  
factor of Section 2.3.6 or 2.4.5 of ASCE 7. That is, grade beams must be either strong or ductile.  
1810.3.13 Seismic ties. Interconnection of piles and socketed drilled shaft deep foundations is  
necessary to prevent differential movement of the components of the foundation during an  
earthquake. It is well known that a building must be thoroughly tied together if it is to  
successfully resist earthquake ground motion.  
Individual piles, piers, or pile caps required for structures must be interconnected with  
foundation seismic ties as prescribed in Section 18.13.4 of ACI 318. The intent of this  
requirement is to minimize differential movement or spreading between the footings during  
ground shaking. If slabs on grade, or beams within slabs on grade, are used to meet the tie  
requirement, the load path from footing to slab or beam/slab and across joints in the slab or  
beam/slab should be checked for continuity. The slab or beam must be reinforced for the design  
tension load.  
1810.4 Installation. Care must be used during installation to prevent damage during handling  
and driving. The proper cushion must be used at the driving end. Precast concrete pile  
recommendations for design, manufacture, and installation are given in ACI 543R Guide To  
Design, Manufacture, and Installation of Concrete Piles. Damage to piles can be classified into  
four types\:  
1\. 2. 3. Spalling at the butt or head \(driving end\) caused by high or irregular compressive stress  
concentrations. The spalling may be caused by insufficient cushioning, pile butt not  
square with the pile longitudinal axis, hammer and pile not aligned, reinforcing steel not  
flush or below the top of the pile allowing the hammer force to be transmitted through  
the steel, or insufficient transverse reinforcement.  
Spalling at the tip, which is usually caused by an extremely high driving resistance such  
as when the tip is bearing on a rock.  
Breaking or transverse cracking. This is caused by the rarefaction wave reflected from  
the tip. When the hammer strikes the cushion or head, a compression wave is produced  
that travels down the pile. The wave can be reflected from the tip as a rarefaction  
\(tension\) wave or a compression wave depending on the soil stiffness. Rarefaction  
waves usually occur when the soil at the tip is soft with very little resistance to  
penetration, causing tension waves that can cause significant tensile damage. This  
phenomenon usually occurs only in long piles exceeding 50 feet \(15,240 mm\).  
Prestressed piles have more resistance to rarefaction damage than do conventionally  
reinforced piles. The hammer energy should be reduced when driving long piles through  
soft soils.  
4\. Spiral or transverse cracking may be caused by a combination of torsional stress and  
rarefaction stress. Torsion is usually caused by excessive restraint in the leads.  
In the case of precast-prestressed piles, because of the precompression, less care is needed in  
the handling and driving than for conventionally reinforced piles, and prestressed piles are, in  
general, more durable than conventionally reinforced precast concrete piles.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIf a deep foundation element consists of two or more sections of various materials or different  
types of deep foundation elements spliced together, each section is required to satisfy the  
applicable installation requirements of this section. Generally referred to as “composite piles,  
”  
these refer to deep foundation elements placed in series, such as a CIP concrete deep foundation  
element placed over a submerged wood pile.  
1810.4.1 Structural integrity. Deep foundation elements can be exposed to damage or could  
potentially cause damage to surrounding areas, especially piles that are generally installed by  
either driving, vibration, jacking, jetting, direct weight, or a combination of such methods. Most  
types of piles are exposed to some degree of damage during placement. However, with  
knowledge of soil conditions and the proper selection of equipment, installation methods, and  
techniques, damage may be prevented or minimized.  
Due care must be exercised during pile installation to avoid interference with adjacent piles or  
other structures so as to leave their strength and load capacity unimpaired. If any pile is damaged  
during installation so as to affect its structural integrity, the damage must be satisfactorily  
repaired or the pile rejected.  
Displacement piles have their own special issues. As displacement piles are driven within a  
group, progressive compaction of the surrounding soil occurs, particularly where it involves  
closely spaced piles. This can cause piles to be deflected off-line because of the buildup of  
unequal soil pressures around the piles. Soil compaction during driving operations can cause  
extreme variations in pile lengths within a group, with some piles failing to reach specified load-  
bearing material. Ground heave is another effect of soil compaction \(see discussion, Section  
1810.4.6\).  
To prevent or significantly reduce the problems associated with soil compaction, the driving  
sequence of pile installations becomes an important consideration. For example, if the outer piles  
of a group are driven first so that the inner piles, because of soil compaction, fetch up to  
specified sets \(hammer blows\) at much higher elevations than the outer piles, the total load-  
bearing value of the group will be adversely affected. As another example, starting pile driving at  
the edge of a group makes the piles progressively more difficult to drive and results in a one-  
sided bearing group. The general driving practice is to work from the center of a group outward.  
For large groups consisting of rows of widely spaced piles, driving can be done progressively  
from one side to the other.  
The provisions within Section 1810.4 are to ensure pile structural integrity by adhering to  
proper installation procedures. The code cannot cover all possibilities, however, thus establishing  
the need for the general nature of this section.  
1810.4.1.1 Compressive strength of precast concrete piles. Handling and driving forces will  
likely govern pile strength requirements. Through the use of steam cure and Type III cements, 75  
percent of specified strength, which is required prior to driving, can be achieved relatively  
quickly.  
1810.4.1.2 Shafts in unstable soils. During construction of drilled piles, potential problems  
include caving, ground water, and other issues. Most of these problems generally relate to soil  
conditions, including soil or rock debris accumulating at the base of the pile or occurring in the  
pile shaft, reductions in the shaft cross section caused by the necking of soil walls because of soft  
materials or earth pressures, discontinuities in the deep foundation shaft, hollows on the surface  
of the shaft, and other problems related to the drilling operations.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1810.4.1.3 Driving near uncased concrete. These requirements are intended to prevent damage  
to uncured concrete in adjacent deep foundation elements from the soil displacements caused by  
driving adjacent elements. The spacing requirements should not be construed to mean that the  
center-to-center spacing must not be closer than six average diameters of a cased element in  
granular soils nor within one-half the pile depth in cohesive soils; just that deep elements cannot  
be driven at that spacing within 48 hours of placement of concrete.  
1810.4.1.4 Driving near cased concrete. The restrictions on driving within four and one-half  
average diameters of a cased element filled with concrete less than 24 hours old are primarily to  
avoid damage to uncured concrete in adjacent deep foundation elements.  
1810.4.1.5 Defective timber piles. Damage to the pile, including breakage, should be suspected  
when there is a sudden drop in penetration resistance while driving that cannot be explained by  
the soil profile. The pile should be withdrawn for examination. If penetration resistance should  
suddenly increase, driving should be stopped to avoid possible damage. A significant problem  
encountered during installation of timber piles is damage from overdriving. Overdriving can  
cause failure by bending, brooming of the tip, crushing, brooming at the butt end, or splitting or  
breaking along the pile section. See Figure 1810-3.  
Figure 1810-3 Effect of overdriving timber piles.  
1810.4.2 Identification. All deep foundation materials must be identified for conformity to the  
code requirements and construction specifications. Information such as strength \(species and  
grade for timber piles\), dimensions, and other pertinent information is required. Such  
identifications must be provided for all deep foundation elements, whether they are taken from  
manufacturers’ stock or made for a particular project. Identifications are to be maintained from  
the point of manufacture through the shipment, on-site handling, storage, and installation of the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationpiles. Manufacturers, upon request, usually furnish certificates of compliance with construction  
specifications. In the absence of adequate data, piles must be tested to demonstrate conformity to  
the specified grade.  
In addition to mill certificates \(steel piles\), identification is made through plant manufacturing  
or inspection reports \(precast concrete and timber piles\) and delivery tickets \(concrete\). Timber  
piles are stamped \(labeled\) with information such as producer, species, treatment, and length.  
Identification is essential when high-yield-strength steel is specified. Frequently, pile cutoff  
lengths are reused and pile material may come from a jobber, a contractor’s yard, or a material  
supplier. In such cases, mill certificates are not available and the steel should be tested to see if it  
complies with the code requirements and the project specifications.  
1810.4.3 Location plan. A plan clearly showing the designation of all deep foundation elements  
on a project by an identification system is to be filed with the building official before the  
installation is started. The inspector \(see discussion in Chapter 17 on special inspection\) must  
keep piling logs and other records and submit written reports based on this identification system.  
The use of such a system becomes particularly important at sites where the variations in soil  
profiles are so extensive that it becomes necessary to manufacture piles of different lengths to  
satisfy bearing conditions.  
The building official should also be furnished copies of all modifications to the original deep  
foundation location plan that may be necessary as the work proceeds \(as-built drawings\). This  
would show elements added, eliminated, or relocated. Such records would facilitate the use of  
existing deep foundations in the future \(see Section 1810.1.2\) if the structure is altered or another  
structure is built on the site.  
1810.4.4 Preexcavation. There are several important reasons for the use of preexcavation to  
facilitate the installation of foundation piles. Some of these purposes are\:  
• To install piles through upper strata of hard soil.  
• To penetrate through subsurface obstructions, such as timbers, boulders, rip rap, thin  
stone strata, and the like.  
• To reduce or eliminate the possibility of ground heave that could lift adjacent structures  
or piles already driven.  
• To reduce ground pressures resulting from soil displacement during driving and to  
prevent the lateral movement of adjacent piles or structures.  
• To reduce the amount of driving required to seat the piles in their proper load-bearing  
strata.  
• To reduce the possibility of damaging vibrations or jarring of adjacent structures, as well  
as reduce the amount of noise, all of which are associated with pile-driving operations.  
• To accommodate the placement of piles that may be somewhat longer than the leads of  
the pile-driving equipment.  
The two most common methods employed in preexcavation operations are prejetting and  
predrilling. Jetting is usually effective in most types of soils, except very coarse and loose gravel  
and highly cohesive soils. Jetting is most effective in granular materials. Generally, jetting in  
cohesive soils is not very practical or especially useful and should be avoided in soils containing  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationvery coarse gravel, cobbles, or small boulders. These stones cannot be removed by the jet and  
tend to collect at the bottom of the hole, preventing pile penetration below that depth.  
Jetting operations must be carefully controlled to avoid excessive loss of soil, which could  
affect the load-bearing capacity of piles already installed or the stability of adjacent structures.  
Piles should be driven below the depth of the jetted hole until the required resistance or  
penetration is obtained. Before this preexcavation method is used, consideration should be given  
to the possibility that jetting, unless strictly controlled, can adversely affect load transfer,  
particularly as it involves the placement of nontapered piles.  
Predrilling or coring before driving is effective in most types of soils and is a more  
controllable method of preexcavation than jetting. The risk of adversely affecting the structural  
integrity of adjacent piles or structures or the frictional capacity of piles is considerably less than  
jetting.  
Predrilling can be performed as a dry operation or as a wet rotary process. Dry drilling can be  
done by using a continuous-flight auger or a short-flight auger attached to the end of a drill stem  
or kelly bar. Wet drilling requires a hollow-stem continuous-flight auger or a hollow drill stem  
employing the use of spade bits. When the wet rotary process of predrilling is used, bentonite  
slurry or plain water is circulated to keep the hole open. As in the case of jetting, piles should be  
driven with tips below the predrilled hole. This is necessary to prevent any voids or very loose or  
soft soils from occurring below the pile tip.  
1810.4.5 Vibratory driving. The use of vibratory drivers for the installation of piles is not  
applicable to all types of soil conditions. They are effective in granular soils with the use of  
nondisplacement piles, such as steel H-piles and pipe piles driven open ended. Vibratory drivers  
are also used for extracting piles or temporary casings employed in the construction of CIP  
concrete deep foundation elements.  
Vibratory drivers, either low or high frequency, cause the pile to penetrate the soil by  
longitudinal vibrations. Although this type of pile driver can produce good results in the  
installation of nondisplacement piles under favorable soil conditions, the greatest difficulty is the  
lack of a reliable method of estimating the load-bearing capacity. After the pile has been installed  
with a vibratory driver, pile capacity can be determined by using an impact-type hammer to set  
the pile in its final position. Load tests are not required if the pile is to be used for lateral  
resistance only.  
One method to determine pile capacity is to calibrate the power consumption in relation to the  
rate of penetration. Nonetheless, the use of a vibratory driver is only permitted where the pile  
load capacity is established by load tests in accordance with the requirements of Section  
1810.3.3.1.2.  
1810.4.6 Heaved elements. Piles that are driven into saturated plastic clay materials can often  
displace a volume of soil equal to that of the piles themselves. When this happens, the soil  
displacement sometimes occurs as ground heave and may lift adjacent deep foundation elements  
already driven. Under such conditions, heaved deep foundation elements may no longer be  
properly seated and a loss of pile capacity occurs. Heaved piles must be redriven to firm bearing  
to again develop the required capacity and penetration. If heaved piles are not redriven, their  
capacity must be verified by load tests made in accordance with the requirements of Section  
1810.3.3.1.2.  
This section applies only to piles that can be safely redriven after installation. Heaved uncased  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationCIP concrete deep foundation elements or sectional piles with joints that cannot take tension  
should be abandoned and replaced. When redriving heaved piles, a comparable driving system or  
the same as that of the initial driving should be employed. It should be noted that in redriving  
concrete-filled pipe piles, the driving characteristics of the pile have been altered and the pile is  
substantially stiffer than when the empty pipe was initially driven. In such cases, the required  
driving resistance would be less than originally required.  
One method used to prevent or reduce objectionable soil displacement is to remove some of  
the soil in the spaces to be occupied by the piles. This is done by predrilling the pile holes \(see  
discussion, Section 1810.4.4\).  
1810.4.7 Enlarged base cast-in-place elements. Enlarged base elements are intended to be end-  
bearing-type deep foundation elements that spread the bearing load over a larger area than a  
prismatic element, thereby increasing capacity. Enlarged base deep elements may be either cased  
or uncased. Enlarged base elements are used only in granular soils, which, because of the voids  
between soil particles, allow densification of the soils around the deep element tip without  
creating excessive pressures. One type is the compacted base type, which consists of a bulb-  
shaped footing formed after driving the shaft casing to its final depth. Another type is the  
concrete-pedestal type, in which a truncated cone- or pyramid-shaped precast concrete tip larger  
than the steel casing diameter is driven into the soil with the casing. See Figure 1810-4.  
Figure 1810-4 Enlarged base pile cased or uncased shafts.  
Installation must employ the same methods used to install the load test piles. The compacted  
base pile is usually installed by driving a steel casing. A zero slump concrete plug is placed at the  
tip of the casing and impacted with a heavy drop weight, thereby driving the casing and plug.  
Sometimes a gravel plug is used rather than zero slump concrete. When the casing and plug have  
been driven to the required depth, the plug is driven out and the bulb is formed by progressively  
compacting additional layers of zero slump concrete. A welded reinforcing steel cage is added  
where required. If the deep foundation element is to be uncased, the shaft is formed by  
compacting zero slump concrete in small lifts as the casing is withdrawn. If the deep foundation  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationelement is to be cased, as would be required for piles through peats or other organic soils, the  
shaft is formed by inserting a steel shell inside the drive casing after forming the bulb,  
withdrawing the drive casing, and filling the shell with conventional concrete. The precast base-  
type pile is installed with the precast base placed at the tip of a mandrel-driven steel shell.  
A problem that occurs with the precast base type and the cased bulb-type piles is that an  
annular space between the casing and the soil remains. Either the pile must be designed as a  
slender reinforced concrete column governed by buckling, or the annular space must be filled to  
provide the requisite lateral support. The usual practice is to fill the annular space by pumping  
grout.  
1810.4.8 Hollow-stem augered, CIP elements. In drilling the pile hole, the hollow-stem auger  
should be rotated and advanced continuously until the required tip elevation is reached. Concrete  
is then pumped through the hollow stem, filling the hole from the bottom up as the auger is  
withdrawn. The volume of placed concrete must be monitored and should equal or exceed the  
theoretical volume of the augered hole. An excess concrete volume of 10 percent is not  
uncommon, but even larger excesses can be expected where soils are more porous. If the amount  
of concrete pumped into the hole is considerably more than the anticipated volume, then the  
cause should be investigated.  
If the pile-concreting operation is interrupted, a pressure drop occurs while pumping the  
concrete, the auger is improperly handled and is raised too fast, or anything else happens that  
could damage the pile or cause a reduction in the required pile section size, then the hollow-stem  
auger must be redrilled to the required tip elevation and the pile reformed from the bottom up.  
Unless approved by the building official, no new pile holes are to be drilled or injected with  
concrete if they are located within a center-to-center distance of six pile diameters from other  
adjacent piles containing fresh concrete that has not been allowed to set for a period of 12 hours  
or more. This is to reduce the possibility of damage to adjacent piles. If the concrete surface of a  
completed pile is observed to drop below its cast elevation as a result of the drilling of adjacent  
piles, then the completed pile should be rejected and replaced. Such an occurrence could indicate  
some deformation along the pile shaft that could affect its structural integrity.  
181 0.4.9 Socketed drilled shafts. One of the potential problems during construction of caisson  
piles is that some water can seep into the bottom of the pile opening through rock joints or socket  
fissures. Sometimes, water may seep into the opening at the end of the pipe casing because of  
incomplete seating of the pipe into the rock material. If water in the hole cannot be controlled by  
ejection or other methods, the concrete may be placed by a tremie or other methods approved by  
the building official. A brief description of the installation sequence of caisson piles is given in  
Section 1810.3.9.6.  
1810.4.10 Micropiles. Micropiles are defined in Chapter 2 and design and detailing is outlined  
in Section 1810.3.10. Micropile boreholes are typically advanced by either rotary drilling or  
rotary percussive drilling. Installation requirements differ based on whether a steel casing is  
permanent or temporary or not provided \(IBC Section 1810.4.10 Items 6, 1, and 2, respectively\).  
1810.4.11 Helical piles. Helical piles are defined in Chapter 2. See Sections 1810.3.1.5 and  
1810.3.5.3.5.  
1810.4.12 Special inspection. See analysis and discussions in Chapter 17 regarding special

Section 1908 Shotcrete  
Key Points  
Chapter 19 of the 2021 IBC® references the 2019 edition of ACI 318, Building Code  
Requirements for Structural Concrete. The 2019 version of ACI 318 includes several  
significant changes from the 2014 version which was referenced in both the 2015 and 2018  
IBC. Some of the changes include new concrete shear wall provisions, revised requirements  
for deep foundations, new beam-to-column joint requirements for concrete frames that are not  
part of the seismic-force-resisting system and for frames located in SDC A, and allowances for  
the use of Grade 80 and Grade 100 reinforcing steel  
Section 1901 General  
1901.1 Scope. Chapter 19 provides minimum requirements governing the materials, quality  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcontrol, design, and construction of structural concrete elements of any structure erected under  
the requirements of the IBC. The concrete chapter, like other chapters within the IBC,  
incorporates design requirements by reference and points the user to industry standards. In this  
case, Chapter 19 references ACI 318.  
1901.2 Plain and reinforced concrete. This section requires that structural concrete be designed  
and constructed in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 19 and ACI 318 as amended in  
Section 1905. Chapter 35 specifies which edition of ACI 318 must be used.  
This section states that Chapter 19 does not govern the design and construction of soil-  
supported slabs \(i.e., slabs on grade\), unless the slab transmits vertical loads or lateral forces  
from other portions of the structure to the soil, although Sections 1904, Durability Requirements,  
and 1907, Minimum Slab Provisions, do apply. The equivalent of Section 1907 does not exist in  
ACI 318.  
1901.3 Anchoring to concrete. Section 1901.3 references ACI 318 for anchorage to concrete,  
and specifies the types of anchors covered such as cast-in-place bolts and studs and post-installed  
expansion, undercut, screw, and adhesive anchors. The amendments in Section 1905.1.8 are  
essentially carryovers from previous exceptions pertaining to out-of-plane anchorage of concrete  
tilt-up walls and in-plane anchorage of light frame shear walls using wood sills or cold-formed  
steel tracks.  
1901.4 Composite structural steel and concrete structures. Section 2206 is referenced for  
design of composite structures involving structural steel and reinforced concrete. For other than  
seismic design, Section 2206 references AISC 360 and ACI 318. Seismic design of structural  
steel systems acting compositely with reinforced concrete using an R factor from Table 12.2-1 of  
ASCE 7 must be designed and detailed in accordance with AISC 341.  
1901.5 Construction documents. This section provides a list of eleven items that are required to  
be shown on the design plans and construction documents. The intent behind this list is to  
address the basic elements needed for clarity and to properly convey design intent when selecting  
concrete as the structural frame material. See Sections 107 and 1603 for additional structural-  
related requirements pertaining to construction documents.  
1901.6 Special inspections and tests. This section provides a cross-reference to the special  
inspection requirements of IBC Chapter 17. Section 1705.3 contains special inspection  
requirements for structural concrete. Chapter 26 of ACI 318 also contains inspection  
requirements for structural concrete however, it defers to the building code where adopted.  
1901.7 Tolerances for structural concrete. Prior to the 2021 IBC, structural concrete tolerances  
were not specifically addressed in the code. This was always seen as a responsibility of the  
design professional; however, tolerances are often not included on the construction documents. If  
the design team does not specify concrete tolerances on the construction documents, Section  
1901.7.1 now refers to ACI 117, Specification for Tolerances for Concrete Construction and  
Materials, for tolerances in relation to cast-in-place concrete elements, and Section 1901.7.2  
refers to ACI ITG-7, Specification for Tolerances for Precast Concrete, for tolerances associated  
with precast concrete elements.  
These standards are valuable tools for design professionals, contractors, building officials, and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationspecial inspection agencies for ensuring that appropriate tolerances are met for structural  
concrete elements. ACI 117 describes tolerances for materials, foundations, buildings, tilt-up  
construction, and more. ACI ITG-7 provides both dimensional and erection tolerances for  
structural and nonstructural precast elements.  
Section 1902 Coordination of Terminology  
This section of the code coordinates the definitions for common terms that are used in the IBC,  
ACI 318, and ASCE 7. Section 1902.1.1 clarifies that the term “design displacement” refers to  
the total lateral deflection that occurs at the floor level when considering the design level  
earthquake. This section also refers to Section 12.8.6 of ASCE 7 for how to calculate this  
“design displacement.  
”  
Section 1902.1.2 addresses “special structural walls” that are of either cast-in-place or precast  
concrete. This section clarifies that design of these walls shall not simply comply with the  
seismic provisions included in ACI 318 Chapter 18 but must also be shown to comply with the  
requirements for “ordinary” cast-in-place or precast structural walls. Section 1902.1.2 also  
clarifies that while ASCE 7 uses the term “special reinforced concrete shear walls,  
” this should  
be considered a “special structural wall.  
”  
Section 1903 Specifications for Tests and Materials  
1903.1 General. This section specifies that materials required to produce concrete and the  
testing of such materials must be in compliance with the provisions of ACI 318. The referenced  
provisions include those regarding cement, aggregates, water, steel reinforcement, admixtures,  
and storage of materials. Requirements for concrete including materials, proportioning,  
production, and construction are covered in Sections 26.4 and 26.5 of ACI 318. Requirements for  
reinforcement including materials and construction are covered in Section 26.6.  
1903.2 Special inspections. Chapter 17 of the IBC contains detailed special inspection and  
testing requirements for concrete structures that are not included in ACI 318. Section 1903.2  
makes these IBC Chapter 17 requirements applicable whenever required by the provisions of that  
chapter.  
1903.3 Glass fiber-reinforced concrete. This section in the IBC, which is not found in ACI  
318, requires that glass fiber-reinforced concrete \(GFRC\) and the materials used in such concrete  
conform to PCI 128, Specification for Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete Panels. This publication  
contains the latest information on the planning, design, manufacture, and installation of GFRC  
panels.  
1903.4 Flat wall insulating concrete form \(ICF\) systems. This section references ASTM  
E2634 for the material used to make forms for insulating concrete form \(ICF\) systems using  
molded expanded polystyrene \(EPS\) insulation panels. ICFs are rigid plastic foam forms used in  
the construction of cast-in-place concrete structural members. The ICFs remain in place as  
permanent building insulation for energy-efficient, cast-in-place, reinforced concrete walls,  
floors, roofs, beams, and columns. The forms are interlocking modular units that are dry-stacked  
\(without mortar\) and filled with concrete. ICFs are generally manufactured from polystyrene or  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationpolyurethane. Reinforcing steel is placed in the forms and then concrete is pumped into the  
cavity to form the structural portion of the walls. The forms provide thermal and acoustic  
insulation, space to run electrical conduit and plumbing, and backing for interior and exterior  
finishes. ASTM E 2634 applies to ICF systems that consist of molded EPS insulation panels that  
are connected by cross ties and act as permanent formwork for cast-in-place reinforced concrete  
structural members such as reinforced concrete beams, lintels, exterior and interior bearing and  
nonbearing walls, foundations, and retaining walls. ASTM E 2634 lists test methods appropriate  
for establishing ICF system performance as a permanent concrete forming system.  
Section 1904 Durability Requirements  
1904.1 Structural concrete. Durability requirements for structural concrete may be found  
within Chapter 19 of ACI 318 and have been adopted through reference, with certain exceptions.  
These provisions emphasize the importance of considering durability requirements before  
selecting a desired material strength \( and depth of cover for reinforcing steel. They include  
exposure categories and classes with applicable durability requirements for concrete in a unified  
format.  
Exposure categories and classes. Concrete is required to be assigned to exposure classes in  
accordance with ACI 318 Section 19.3.1, based on\:  
1\. 2. 3. Exposure to freezing or thawing in a moist condition or deicer chemicals \(Class F\);  
Exposure to sulfates in water or soil \(Class S\);  
Exposure to water where the concrete is intended to have low permeability \(Class W\);  
and  
4\. Exposure to chlorides from chemicals, salt, saltwater, brackish water, seawater, or spray  
from these sources, where the concrete has steel reinforcement \(Class C\).  
Concrete properties. Concrete mixtures must conform to the most restrictive maximum water-  
cementitious materials \(w/cm\) ratios and maximum specified compressive strength \( \)  
requirements of ACI 318 Section 19.3.2, based on exposure classes assigned in Section 19.3.1.  
Since it is difficult to accurately determine the water-cementitious materials ratio of concrete  
during production, the specified should be reasonably consistent with the water-cementitious  
materials ratio required for durability. This will help ensure that the required water-cementitious  
materials ratio is actually obtained in the field. Because the usual emphasis in inspection is on  
strength, test results substantially higher than the specified strength may lead to a lack of concern  
for quality and production of concrete that exceeds the maximum water-cementitious materials  
ratio. Thus, a concrete strength of 3,000 psi \(20.7 MPa\) and a maximum water-cementitious  
materials ratio of 0.45 should not be specified for a parking structure, if the structure will be  
exposed to deicing salts.  
IBC Section 1904.1 includes an exception to the ACI 318 provisions for buildings less than  
four stories in height that house Group R \(residential\) occupancies. The exception allows  
normal-weight concrete subject to weathering \(freezing and thawing\) to have a minimum  
specified concrete strength of 3,000 psi \(20.7 MPa\). The exception is consistent with the  
International Residential Code® \(IRC®\).  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1904.2 Nonstructural concrete. This section prescribes performance requirements for  
nonstructural concrete. It requires the design professional to assign a freeze-thaw exposure Class  
\(F\) based on the anticipated exposure of nonstructural concrete. Nonstructural concrete must  
have a minimum specified strength of 2,500 psi \(17.2 MPa\) for Class F0, 3,000 psi \(20.7 MPa\)  
for Class F1, and 3,500 psi \(24.1 MPa\) for Classes F2 and F3. Nonstructural concrete is defined  
in Chapter 2 as any element made of plain or reinforced concrete that is not used to transfer  
either gravity or lateral loads to the ground.  
Section 1905 Modifications to ACI 318  
1905.1 General. A summary of the modifications to the provisions of ACI 318 can be found in  
Table 1905-1. A more detailed discussion of each modification is provided below.  
Table 1905-1. IBC Modifications to ACI 318  
1905.1.1 ACI 318 Section 2.3. Modifications are made to existing definitions and new  
definitions supplement those in ACI 318 Section 2.3. ACI definitions of Detailed Plain Concrete  
Structural Wall, Ordinary Precast Structural Wall, Ordinary Reinforced Concrete Structural  
Wall, and Ordinary Structural Plain Concrete Wall are modified to include useful references that  
are not mentioned in the definitions within ACI 318.  
1905.1.2 ACI 318 Section 18.2.1. These modifications state exactly which ACI 318 provisions  
require compliance for structures in different seismic design categories, and make it clear that the  
ordinary structural walls mentioned in Item \(b\) of Section 18.2.1.6 include both cast-in-place  
and precast walls. The use of plain concrete is also specifically prohibited in structures assigned  
to SDC C or higher, other than those permitted by IBC Section 1905.1.7.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation1905.1.3 ACI 318 Section 18.5. This section modifies ACI 318 Section 18.5, by adding new  
Section 18.5.2.2 and renumbering Section 18.5.2.2 and 18.5.2.3 to become 18.5.2.3 and 18.5.2.4.  
Section 18.5.2.2 specifies a minimum ductility requirement for a steel element used in a  
connection between wall panels or between wall panels and the foundation, so that yielding can  
be allowed in that element. This section requires that a yielding steel connection element retain at  
least 80 percent of its design strength at the deformation level corresponding to the design  
displacement of the structure.  
1905.1.4 ACI 318 Section 18.11. This section modifies ACI 318 Section 18.11.2.1 by requiring  
that precast special structural walls satisfy all the requirements for cast-in-place special structural  
walls as specified in Section 18.10, as well as the requirements for precast intermediate structural  
walls specified in Sections 18.5.2.  
1905.1.5 ACI 318 Section 18.13.1.1. This section modifies ACI 18.13.1.1 by adding the  
requirement that the seismic design of foundations comply with relevant provisions in ACI 318,  
unless they are modified by provisions within the IBC Chapter 18, Soils and Foundations. In  
general, the provisions of the IBC Chapter 18 are more stringent than those found in ACI 318  
Section 18.13.  
1905.1.6 ACI 318 Section 14.6. This section adds text to ACI 318 Section 14.6 to specify the  
reinforcement requirement that detailed plain concrete structural walls needed in addition to that  
required for ordinary plain concrete structural walls.  
1905.1.7 ACI 318 Section 14.1.4. This modification replaces ACI 318 Section 14.1.4 in its  
entirety, while serving essentially the same purpose, that is, to prohibit the use of plain concrete  
elements in structures assigned to Seismic Design Category C, D, E, or F, with several specific  
exceptions that permit the use of plain concrete in foundations. This modification describes these  
exceptions in more detail than ACI 318 Section 14.1.4.  
1905.1.8 ACI 318 Section 17.2.3. This modification to ACI 318 provides flexibility in designing  
anchors resisting earthquake forces by providing exceptions to the ACI 318 provisions. Note that  
ACI 318-19 moved provisions from Section 17.2.3 to Section 17.10. However, this change did  
not get incorporated in the 2021 IBC. Table 1905-2 provides a key for mapping applicable  
provisions of ACI 318-14 to ACI 318-19 for the replacement text in IBC Section 1905.1.8.  
Table 1905-2. Updated ACI 318-19 Sections Referenced in IBC 1905.1.8  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThe three numbered exceptions in Section 17.10.6.2 apply to in-plane shear strength of  
anchors in light-frame shear walls. Exception 1 applies to the anchorage of wood sill plates to  
concrete foundations in light-frame construction. Based on light-frame shear wall testing, the  
wood sill plate controls the ductile behavior of the anchorage assembly. If the anchor meets the  
requirements of the exception, then the anchor need not meet the requirements of ACI 318.  
Allowable in-plane shear capacity of the anchor bolt is determined in accordance with NDS  
Table 11E rather than ACI 318.  
Exception 2 applies to the anchorage of cold-formed steel track to concrete foundations in  
light-frame construction. Based on light-frame shear wall testing, the cold-formed steel track  
controls the ductile behavior of the anchorage assembly. If the anchor meets the requirements of  
the exception, then the anchor need not meet the requirements of ACI 318. Allowable in-plane  
shear capacity of the anchor bolt is determined from AISI S100 Section E3.3.1 rather than ACI  
318.  
There are multiple criteria to meet in order to use Exception 1 or 2 for the design of anchor  
bolts connecting wood sill plates or CFS tracks of shear walls to the foundation in light-frame  
structures. The maximum nominal diameter of the anchor is ⅝ inches \(15.9 mm\); anchors must  
be embedded a minimum of 7 inches \(178 mm\) into the footing and located a minimum of 1¾  
inches \(44 mm\) from the edge of the concrete parallel to the wood sill plate or steel track, and a  
minimum of 15 diameters from the edge of the concrete perpendicular to the wood sill plate or  
steel track; the wood sill plate must be a nominal 2x or 3x, and cold-formed steel track must be  
within a thickness range of 33 mil to 68 mil.  
For light-frame construction, Exception 3 allows use of Section 17.7.2.1\(c\) rather than  
Section 17.10.6.3. Section 202 defines light-frame construction as a system where vertical and  
horizontal structural elements are primarily formed by repetitive wood or cold-formed steel  
framing members.  
Section 1906 Footings for Light-Frame Construction  
In general, design and construction of structural concrete members must comply with ACI 318.  
Section 1906 provides an exception for plain concrete footings that support Group R-3  
occupancies or other occupancies not more than a single story above grade plane. Plain concrete  
footings having a thickness of 6 inches \(152 mm\) are allowed as long as the footings do not  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationextend more than 4 inches \(102 mm\) to either side of the supported wall.  
Section 1907 Minimum Slab Provisions  
Slabs on ground may be plain concrete without any reinforcement or may contain shrinkage and  
temperature reinforcement in the form of reinforcing bars, wire mesh, or fiber. As discussed  
previously, ACI 318 does not govern the design and construction of soil supported slabs unless  
the slab transmits loads. Designers, however, may apply any ACI 318 provision that would help  
ensure proper strength, durability, and abrasion resistance.  
1907.1 General. This section specifies a minimum slab thickness of 3½ inches \(89 mm\). This  
section also requires that a vapor retarder be installed immediately below the slab to retard vapor  
transmission. There are, however, a number of exceptions where a vapor retarder is not required.  
Although good-quality concrete is practically impermeable to the passage of water \(that is not  
under significant pressure\), concrete is not impervious to the passage of water vapors. If the  
surface of the slab is not sealed, water vapor will pass through the slab. If a floor finish such as  
linoleum, vinyl tile, wood flooring or any type of covering is placed on top of the slab, the  
moisture is trapped in the slab. Any floor finish adhering to the concrete may eventually loosen  
or buckle or blister.  
Many of the moisture problems associated with enclosed slabs on ground can be prevented or  
minimized by installing vapor retarders, such as polyethylene sheeting or other approved  
materials, between the slab and the ground. Such retarders are needed under slabs in habitable  
spaces. Where garages, utility areas, and similar spaces are not to be heated or occupied, vapor  
barriers are not required but may be applied. If moisture migration is not expected to be a  
problem based on the occupancy of a building, Exception 3 permits the vapor retarder to be  
omitted.  
Section 1908 Shotcrete  
Shotcrete is concrete conveyed through a hose and pneumatically projected at high velocity onto  
a surface. Originally the term “shotcrete” referred to wet-mixed ejected concrete and the term  
“gunite” referred to a proprietary method using dry-mixed concrete that was hydrated at the  
nozzle. The term “shotcrete” is now generally used for both wet-mix and dry-mix methods of  
ejecting concrete onto a surface.  
Section 1908 simply refers to ACI 318 for all provisions related to shotcrete design and  
construction. Previous to the 2021 IBC, Section 1908 included specific provisions in relation to  
material, proportions, tests, rebound, joints, curing, and more. These provisions are now all  
included within the ACI 318 standard.

Section 2002 Materials  
Key Points  
This chapter covers the requirements for quality, design, fabrication, and erection of aluminum  
structures.  
Section 2002 Materials  
The IBC® references two aluminum industry design standards\: Aluminum Design Manual \(ADM  
—2020\) and Aluminum Sheet Metal Work in Building Construction, Fourth Edition \(ASM 35—  
00\).  
2002.1 General. The 2020 ADM includes numerous revisions from the 2010 version of the  
standard that was previously referenced in the IBC. New provisions include block shear, pull-out  
strength of screws, weld-affected strengths, post-weld heat treated strengths, new alloy tempers,  
and more. The ADM includes design provisions for aluminum structural members and their  
connections in addition to providing minimum strengths for aluminum products.  
ASM 35 applies to the proper use of aluminum in roofing, flashing, and other sheet metal  
fabrications used in building construction. ASM 35 does not address proprietary or preformed  
sheet metal products, such as siding or curtain wall systems, but is intended for site-fabricated  
installations.  
The nominal loads used to design aluminum structures are as required by Chapter 16, which  
references ASCE 7 for many loads, most notably environmental loads.

Key Points  
This chapter covers the materials, design, construction, and quality of masonry. TMS 402,  
Building Code Requirements for Masonry Structures, TMS 403, Direct Design Handbook for  
Masonry Structures, and TMS 602, Specification for Masonry Structures are the referenced  
standards for masonry. These standards are developed and published by The Masonry Society  
\(TMS\)  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 2101 General  
The masonry provisions govern the materials, design, construction, and quality for masonry  
designed in accordance with allowable stress design, strength design, or empirical design, and for  
glass masonry and masonry fireplaces and chimneys. Masonry veneer is covered in Chapter 14  
of the IBC® and Chapter 12 of TMS 402. TMS 402 Chapter 1 lists specific masonry items that  
need to be included on the construction documents.  
2101.2 Design methods. This section references TMS 402 for all design methods except the  
direct design method and architectural cast stone which are described in TMS 403 and TMS 404,  
respectively. Prestressed masonry must be designed in accordance with Chapters 1 through 7 and  
10 of TMS 402 and the seismic requirements in Section 2106.  
A simplified design method for single-story, concrete masonry buildings is found in the  
referenced standard TMS 403, Direct Design Handbook for Masonry Structures. The  
methodology is based on strength design provisions and factored load combinations for dead,  
roof live, wind, seismic, snow, and rain loads in accordance with ASCE 7. The direct design  
procedure is a table-based structural design method that permits the user to follow a series of  
steps to design and specify relatively simple, single-story, concrete masonry bearing-wall  
structures. The method is simple to implement compared to conventional design approaches, but  
it limits the design to only those configurations addressed by the standard. It introduces slightly  
more conservatism compared to conventional design procedures as a result of the conditions and  
assumptions inherent to the design method. There are limitations based on ground snow load,  
wind speed, mapped seismic spectral acceleration, the type of masonry walls and roof systems  
used, and minimum reinforcing requirements. TMS 403 is intended to capture many of the  
simple load-bearing masonry structures commonly designed today.  
It should be emphasized that irrespective of the design method used, masonry structures must  
also comply with applicable seismic design requirements prescribed in Section 2106 based on  
the seismic design category of the building or structure. The seismic design category of a  
structure is determined in accordance with Section 1613.2.5 based on the potential seismic  
ground motion at the site \(SDS and SD1\), soil type \(Site Class\), and use of the structure. Section  
2106 references Chapter 7 of TMS 402 without amendments for seismic design of masonry  
structures.  
2101.2.1 Masonry veneer. Masonry veneer is required to comply with the requirements in  
Chapter 14 of the code, specifically Section 1404.  
2101.3 Special inspection. Section 2101.3 refers to Chapter 17 for special inspection  
requirements, which in turn references the quality assurance requirements specified in TMS 602.  
See discussion under Section 1705.4.  
Section 2102 Notations  
This section defines notations that are made throughout the Chapter.  
Section 2103 Masonry Construction Materials  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThis section contains minimum requirements for various masonry construction materials and  
references TMS 602 in many cases. The IBC references hundreds of ASTM Standards and  
Specifications, many of which apply to masonry construction materials.  
2103.1 Masonry units. Specifications for various types of masonry units are given in Article 2.3  
of TMS 602. Table 2103-1 shows the tables in TMS 602 Commentary that contain requirements  
for various types of masonry materials. Note that structural clay tile used for nonstructural  
purposes in fireproofing structural members and wall furring need not meet the specified  
compressive strength but must meet the fire-resistance rating required by Table 705.5 determined  
in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263.  
Table 2103-1. Concrete Masonry Unit Specifications  
2103.1.1 Second-hand units. Some masonry materials may be reused, provided that they meet  
all the code requirements for new materials. Note, however, that Section 104.9.1 restricts the use  
of used materials unless specifically approved by the building official. One should exercise  
caution in approving reuse of materials. The applicable material or design standards should be  
consulted to determine if reuse of used materials should be permitted. For example, glass block  
units cannot be reused, as indicated in TMS 602 Section 2.3D.  
This section allows the use of salvaged or used brick. Used bricks are often salvaged from  
demolition of old unreinforced masonry buildings. Masonry units manufactured in the past may  
not have the same quality as masonry made to current standards. Caution should also be  
practiced when specifying used brick as a structural material. Even though the brick may appear  
clean, the pores in the bedding faces may be filled with cement paste, lime, and other deleterious  
microscopic particles that may reduce the absorption properties of the brick, thereby adversely  
affecting the mortar and masonry bond and reducing mortar strength. Testing for the absorption  
rate of used masonry units in accordance with ASTM C 67 will give an indication of the bonding  
qualities of used units with mortar. Used masonry units are best used as veneers, where the units  
are not relied upon for structural strength.  
2103.2 Mortar. Masonry mortar, surface bonding mortar, mortar for ceramic tile, and mortar for  
adhered masonry veneer are covered in Section 2103.2.1, 2103.2.2, 2103.2.3, or 2103.2.4.  
2103.2.1 Masonry mortar. Mortar for use in masonry construction must conform to ASTM C  
270 in accordance with Article 2.1 of TMS 602. Mortars proportioned in accordance with Table  
1 of ASTM C270 should have a cube strength in excess of that required by ASTM C 270 for the  
various mortar types. Type M mortar is high-strength mortar having a minimum average 28-day  
compressive strength of 2,500 psi \(17.2 MPa\). Type M mortar is suitable for general use, and is  
recommended where maximum compressive strength is required such as in unreinforced  
masonry below grade. Type S mortar is recommended where a high lateral strength is required  
and is specifically recommended for reinforced masonry. The minimum average compressive  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstrength for Type S mortar is 1,800 psi \(12.4 MPa\). Type N mortar is a medium-strength mortar  
having a minimum average compressive strength of 750 psi \(5.2 MPa\). Type N mortar may be  
used where high compressive or lateral strength is not required. Type N is generally used in  
exposed masonry above grade where exposed to weather. Type O mortar is a low-strength  
mortar having a minimum average compressive strength of 350 psi \(2.4 MPa\). Type O mortar  
should only be used for nonbearing walls not exposed to severe weathering.  
Table 2 in ASTM C270 allows for the proportioning of mortar to meet the minimum  
requirements for 28-day compressive strength, minimum water retention, and maximum air  
content.  
2103.2.2 Surface-bonding mortar. The specifications for premixed mortar, masonry units, and  
other materials used in constructing dry-stack, surface-bonded masonry, as well as the  
construction requirements, are referenced in this section.  
2103.2.3 Mortars for ceramic wall and floor tile. The code references ANSI A108.1 for  
Portland cement mortars used to lay ceramic tile. Table 2103.2.3 gives compositions of hydrated  
lime, cement, and sand for different applications. Specific provisions are provided for dry-set  
Portland cement mortars, latex-modified Portland cement mortar, epoxy mortar, furan mortar and  
grout, modified epoxy-emulsion mortar and grout, and mortar for adhered masonry veneer.  
Mortar requirements for autoclaved aerated concrete \(AAC\) masonry are covered in TMS  
602\. The requirements for thin-bed mortar and mortar for leveling courses are in Articles 2.1 C.1  
and 2.1 C.2 of TMS 602. Thin-bed mortar is used in AAC masonry construction with joints 0.06  
inch or less. Mortar used for the leveling courses of AAC masonry must be Type M or S.  
2103.3 Grout. Grout proportion requirements are given in Article 2.2 of TMS 602, which  
references ASTM C476. The grout proportioning by volume is in Table 1 of ASTM C476. The  
minimum grout strength requirement of 2,000 psi set forth in the model codes has been removed  
from the code provisions because ASTM C476 permits grout to comply with the minimum  
strength requirement of 2,000 psi or to comply with the proportions given in Table 1. Grout  
batched in accordance with the proportions in the table will have strength in excess of 2,000 psi.  
2103.4 Metal reinforcement and accessories. Requirements for metal reinforcement and  
accessories used in masonry construction reflect national consensus standards. The various  
ASTM standards are listed in Table 2103-2. For a complete list of specifications for  
reinforcement, prestressing tendons, and metal accessories, see Article 2.4 of TMS 602.  
Coatings and corrosion protection requirements for mill galvanized, hot-dipped galvanized,  
and epoxy coating methods are provided in Section 2.4F of TMS 602. Corrosion protection  
requirements for tendons are provided in Section 2.4G of TMS 602.  
Section 2104 Construction  
The provisions in IBC Section 2104, together with the requirements in TMS 602, provide  
minimum requirements to ensure the masonry is properly constructed, consistent with the design  
methods used. The IBC maintains requirements not duplicated in TMS 402 and TMS 602,  
including provisions for masonry supported by wood members \(Section 2104.1.1\) and pertaining  
to molded cornices \(Section 2104.1.2\). More stringent construction requirements and referenced  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationspecifications than those contained in the code may be needed to satisfy aesthetic and  
architectural design criteria. Such requirements should be included in the construction  
documents.  
Table 2103-2. ASTM Standards for Metal Reinforcement and Accessories  
2104.1 Masonry construction. This section cites the applicable code sections and references the  
applicable construction provisions of TMS 602, or TMS 604 for the installation of architectural  
cast stone.  
Section 2105 Quality Assurance  
During development of the IBC, it was noted that masonry damaged in earthquakes and high  
wind events often showed poor quality and workmanship, which often contributed to the  
damage. Many of the masonry structures that failed showed evidence of missing reinforcement,  
missing grout or missing connectors, and various other improper construction techniques. The  
best way to improve quality of construction in the field is through a quality-assurance program  
that ensures proper materials and construction methods are used. From a model code perspective,  
quality assurance during construction is achieved by the special inspection and testing  
requirements in Chapter 17.  
2105.1 General. Section 2105 requires a quality-assurance program to ensure that masonry  
structures are constructed in accordance with the construction documents. Historically, the  
quality-assurance program is achieved through the special inspection and testing requirements  
covered in Chapter 17 of the IBC. However, the specific inspection and verifications for masonry  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstructures are by reference to the quality-assurance provisions in TMS 602. Section 1.6 of TMS  
602 has three levels of quality assurance that are based on the risk category. See discussion of  
Section 1705.4 in regard to special inspection for masonry structures and Table 1705-1, which  
reflects the level of quality assurance required based on the type of masonry structure and risk  
category.  
Acceptance relative to strength requirements. Compliance with minimum specified  
compressive strength is determined by the unit strength method or the prism test method covered  
in Article 1.4B of TMS 602. Where these methods are not used, masonry prisms saw cut from  
constructed masonry can be used to establish compliance in accordance with Article 1.4B.4.  
Testing prisms from constructed masonry. When approved by the building official, masonry  
is permitted to be based on tests of prisms saw cut from the masonry construction. A set of three  
masonry prisms at least 28 days old are saw cut for each 5,000 square feet \(464 m2\) of wall area  
and not less than one set of three masonry prisms for a given project. The testing and  
transportation of the prisms must comply with the requirements of ASTM C1532 and ASTM  
C1314.  
Section 2106 Seismic Design  
2106.1 Seismic design requirements for masonry. As with other structural materials, seismic  
load effects are determined from the IBC, which in turn references ASCE 7, and seismic  
resistance is determined from the specific material design provisions in TMS 402. Seismic  
design of reinforced masonry structures is based on the inelastic ductility response of the  
structure, which reduces the seismic design force level. This is reflected by the R-factor for the  
particular seismic-force-resisting system. Section 1604.9 and ASCE 7 Section 11.1.1 require that  
structures meet all applicable seismic detailing requirements, even though other loads such as  
wind may be greater than the seismic load effects.  
All masonry walls, unless they are isolated on three edges from the in-plane motion of the  
basic structural system, must be considered part of the seismic-force-resisting system and  
designed accordingly. Nonload-bearing walls that are connected to the lateral-force-resisting  
system could be subject to seismic forces. Per TMS 402, elements are classified as participating  
or nonparticipating in the seismic-force-resisting system. Participating elements must be  
designed and detailed to resist seismic forces such as shear walls, columns, beams, and coupling  
elements. Nonparticipating elements can be any masonry element but are not required to be  
designed and detailed to resist seismic forces. Element classifications are described in Section  
7.3 of TMS 402.  
Basic seismic-force-resisting systems. Section 7.3.2 of TMS 402 lists five distinct types of  
conventionally reinforced shear wall systems based on the expected performance of the walls  
with various construction techniques. The five types of masonry shear wall systems are ordinary  
plain \(unreinforced\) masonry, ordinary reinforced masonry, detailed plain \(unreinforced\)  
masonry, intermediate reinforced masonry, and special reinforced masonry shear walls.  
In addition to the five types of conventionally reinforced shear wall systems, three prestressed  
masonry shear wall systems are defined\: ordinary plain \(unreinforced\) prestressed masonry,  
intermediate reinforced prestressed masonry, and special reinforced prestressed masonry shear  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationwalls. The various types of masonry shear wall systems are defined in Section 2.2 of TMS 402.  
The various masonry shear wall types are assigned seismic design coefficients found in ASCE  
7, such as response modification coefficient, R, based on the expected performance and ductility  
of the particular shear wall system used. Certain shear wall types are required in some seismic  
regions, and unreinforced shear wall types are not permitted in intermediate and high seismic-  
risk regions, based on the seismic design category of the building. See Table 12.2-1 of ASCE 7  
for seismic design coefficients for the various types of masonry shear wall systems. ASCE 7  
contains only one prestressed masonry shear wall system. See item A12 of ASCE 7 Table 12.2-1  
for bearing-wall buildings with prestressed masonry shear wall systems, and item B21 of Table  
12.2-1 for building-frame buildings with prestressed masonry shear wall systems. Note that  
unreinforced prestressed masonry shear wall systems are not permitted in Seismic Design  
Categories C, D, E, and F.  
In addition to the eight shear wall systems described above, TMS 402 has an empirically  
designed shear wall and three types of AAC masonry shear walls for a total of 12 different types  
of masonry shear wall systems. The requirements for the different shear walls are given in  
Commentary Table 7.3.2-1 of TMS 402. Table 2106-1 summarizes the requirements for each of  
the different masonry shear wall systems described above. It should be emphasized, however,  
that the limitations and restrictions imposed on the different types of masonry shear wall systems  
are given in Tables 12.2-1 and 12.14-1 of ASCE 7.  
Table 2016-1. Shear Wall Types and Requirementsa  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAnchorage of masonry walls. Section 7.2.3 of TMS 402 references the “legally adopted  
building code” or ASCE 7 for anchorage of masonry walls. Because of the significant out-of-  
plane seismic forces that develop in concrete and masonry walls during seismic ground motion,  
the code requires them to be anchored to roofs and floors that provide lateral support for the wall.  
The anchorage must provide a positive and direct connection capable of resisting the design  
seismic forces. Although the term positive and direct is not explicitly defined in the code, the  
intent is to transfer the lateral loads as directly as possible and not by indirect circuitous load  
paths that are less reliable and more prone to failure during an earthquake.  
IBC Section 1604.8.2 references Section 1.4.4 of ASCE 7 for walls in structures in Seismic  
Design Category A and Section 12.11 for walls in structures in other seismic design categories.  
Section 1.4.4 of ASCE 7 requires the anchorage to develop a design strength equal to 0.2 times  
the weight of the wall tributary to the anchor but not less than 5 psf \(0.239 kN/m2\). Where the  
anchors are used in masonry walls constructed of hollow units or cavity wall systems, the code  
requires them to be embedded in a reinforced grouted structural element within the wall. See the  
discussion under Section 1604.8.2.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFor buildings in Seismic Design Categories B through F, anchorage of concrete and masonry  
walls must be designed in accordance with Section 12.11 of ASCE 7, or Section 12.14.7.5 for the  
simplified seismic design procedure. Section 12.11 requires the anchorage to be designed for the  
greater of several seismic forces, with specified minimum forces. Good resources for wall  
anchorage design are the 2018 IBC SEAOC Structural/Seismic Design Manual Volume 1\: Code  
Application Examples, 2018 IBC SEAOC Structural/Seismic Design Manual Volume 2\:  
Examples for Light-frame, Tilt-up and Masonry Buildings, and Structural Load Determination\:  
2018 IBC and ASCE/SEI 7-16 by David Fanella.  
Requirements based on Seismic Design Category. Seismic design is not optional, but the  
permissible systems and the level of detailing required depend on the seismic design category of  
the building. For example, empirical design is not permitted in Seismic Design Category D, E, or  
F, and empirically designed masonry elements of the seismic-force-resisting system are only  
permitted in Seismic Design Category A. Note that the seismic design requirements are  
cumulative, which means the requirements in Seismic Design Category D include the  
requirements for Seismic Design Category C, and so on.  
Seismic Design Category A. The requirements for Seismic Design Category A are given in  
TMS Section 7.4.1. The interaction of structural and nonstructural elements that may affect the  
seismic response of the structure must be considered. Structural elements must be classified as  
nonparticipating and participating elements. Nonparticipating elements must be isolated from the  
seismic-force-resisting system. Participating elements are elements of the seismic-force-resisting  
system and must be designed and detailed accordingly. Masonry elements in the seismic load  
path to the foundation must be capable of resisting the design seismic forces. TMS 402 does not  
prescribe anchorage and connection forces, because these are design loads. Thus, TMS 402  
references the legally adopted building code or ASCE 7 for determination of anchorage design  
forces. Although drift limits must be met in Seismic Design Category A, it is permitted to  
assume that some of the shear wall types are deemed to meet the drift limits required by ASCE 7.  
See TMS Section 7.2.4. Note that all of the seismic load requirements for Seismic Design  
Category A are entirely self-contained in Section 11.7 of ASCE 7 which refers to the minimal  
structural integrity requirements in Section 1.4.  
Seismic Design Category B. Masonry partition walls, screen walls, and other masonry elements  
that are not specifically designed to resist external loads other than the loads produced by their  
own weight are to be isolated from the rest of the structure so that the forces from the structure  
are not imparted to these elements. Any joints or connections between the structure and these  
isolated elements must be designed to accommodate the design seismic story drift. These  
provisions are the nonparticipating element design requirements of TMS 402 Section 7.4.1.1 and  
apply to buildings in both Seismic Design Categories A and B. All masonry shear wall types are  
permitted in Seismic Design Category B except empirically designed masonry shear walls.  
Seismic Design Category C. Structures in Seismic Design Category C must conform to the  
requirements for Seismic Design Category B, as well as the additional requirements in Section  
7.4.3 of TMS 402. Horizontal or vertical reinforcing is required for nonparticipating elements  
described in Section 7.4.3.1. The vertical reinforcing requirement for nonparticipating elements  
is one No. 4 bar spaced not more than 10 feet on center and within 16 inches of the end of  
masonry walls. Past earthquakes such as the 1971 San Fernando earthquake have demonstrated  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthat connections to columns are particularly vulnerable. Thus, anchor bolts used to connect  
horizontal members to columns require lateral ties. Anchorages used to transfer seismic forces  
from roof and floor diaphragms for AAC masonry shear walls must be embedded in grout.  
Structural clay wall tiles are not permitted in the seismic-force-resisting system. Although  
masonry buildings may be designed to use shear walls to resist seismic forces, columns may be  
incorporated to support gravity loads. TMS 402 permits piers and columns to support lateral  
loads where the R-factor is not greater than 1.5. In this case, TMS 402 stipulates that the lateral  
stiffness at each story level and at each line of lateral resistance be not less than 80 percent of the  
lateral stiffness provided by the shear walls. Columns that resist loads from discontinuous walls,  
and beams that resist loads from discontinuous walls or frames, require minimum transverse  
reinforcement with a ratio of 0.0015. These requirements for strength and toughness are intended  
to prevent local failure or collapse in elements supporting discontinuous portions of the lateral-  
force-resisting system. Inherent in the code philosophy is the assumption that the inelastic  
demands on the structure will be reasonably distributed throughout the lateral-force-resisting  
system. The value of the response modification factor, R, is based on this assumption, as well as  
the assumption of sufficient ductility and overstrength to meet the maximum anticipated seismic  
demands. Elements used to redistribute or transfer the effect of overturning forces and shears  
from stiff discontinuous elements are susceptible to increased localized or concentrated inelastic  
demands, which violate the above assumption, and may not achieve the required ductility. The  
requirement for a minimum amount of transverse reinforcement at a maximum spacing increases  
the maximum usable masonry strain and ductility in the element so that the element will meet the  
maximum seismic demand and distribute the overturning forces and shears without failure.  
Seismic Design Category D. Structures in Seismic Design Category D must conform to the  
requirements for Seismic Design Categories B and C and the additional requirements of Section  
7.4.4 of TMS 402. The vertical reinforcing requirement for nonparticipating elements is one No.  
4 bar spaced not more than 48 inches \(1,219 mm\) on center and within 16 inches \(406 mm\) of  
the end of masonry walls. Lateral ties embedded in grout are required for masonry columns.  
Lateral ties must be anchored with standard 135° \(2.36 rad\) or 180° \(3.14 rad\) hooks. Type N  
mortar and masonry cement is not permitted to be used in participating elements of the seismic-  
force-resisting system.  
Seismic Design Category E or F. Structures in Seismic Design Category E or F must conform  
to the requirements specified for Seismic Design Categories B, C, and D and the additional  
requirements in Section 7.4.5 of TMS 402. Stack bond used in nonparticipating elements  
\(elements that are not a part of the lateral-force-resisting system\) is required to have a horizontal  
reinforcing ratio of at least 0.0015 with a maximum spacing of 24 inches \(610 mm\) on center and  
must be constructed of hollow open-end units grouted solid or two wythes of solid units fully  
grouted. Only special reinforced masonry shear walls are allowed in Seismic Design Categories  
E and F. Refer to Tables 12.2-1 and 12.14-1 of ASCE 7 for the seismic design coefficients,  
limitations, and restrictions pertaining to special reinforced masonry shear walls.  
Special reinforced shear walls. Special reinforced masonry walls are permitted in any seismic  
design category and are the only type of shear wall allowed in Seismic Design Category D and  
above. The special reinforced shear wall has the most favorable \(highest\) R-factor of the shear  
wall types, and as such requires specific reinforcement to improve and ensure ductility.  
The special reinforced shear wall reinforcement requirements are given in Section 7.3.2.6 of  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTMS 402\:  
\(a\) \(b\) \(c\) The maximum spacing of vertical reinforcement is the lesser of one-third the shear wall  
length or one-third the shear wall height, but not more than 48 inches \(1,219 mm\) for  
running bond and 24 inches \(610 mm\) for stack bond.  
Horizontal reinforcing must be uniformly distributed and embedded in grout.  
The minimum cross-sectional area of vertical reinforcement is one-third the area of  
required shear reinforcement. The sum of the cross-sectional area of horizontal and  
vertical reinforcement is at least 0.020 times the cross-sectional area of the wall, and the  
minimum cross-sectional area of reinforcement in each direction is 0.007 times the  
cross-sectional area of the wall. For stack bond masonry, the minimum cross-sectional  
area of horizontal reinforcement is 0.015 times the cross-sectional area of the wall.  
\(d\) \(e\) Shear reinforcement must be anchored to vertical reinforcing with standard hooks.  
Masonry laid in stack bond must be hollow open-end units grouted solid or two wythes  
of solid units grouted.  
Special reinforced shear walls designed by the allowable stress design method. Special  
reinforced shear walls designed by the allowable stress design method are to be designed to resist  
1.5 times the code-prescribed in-plane shear force determined from ASCE 7. However, the 1.5  
multiplier does not apply to the overturning moment or out-of-plane forces. See Section  
7.3.2.6.1.2\. The intent of this requirement is to ensure that flexural failure dominates in order to  
ensure ductile performance.  
Section 2107 Allowable Stress Design  
2107.1 General. Section 2107 references the requirements in Chapters 1 through 8 of TMS 402,  
with additional modifications in Sections 2107.2 and 2107.3. The allowable stress design  
provisions in the standard are based on the use of full design stresses only, assuming that all  
engineered structural masonry will have some level of special inspection. These minimum levels  
of special inspection have accordingly been incorporated into Section 1705.4, which references  
the quality-assurance provision of TMS 402. It is important to note that the one-third increase in  
allowable stresses that was permitted for load combinations that include earthquake and wind  
forces is no longer permitted in TMS 402. From an IBC perspective, masonry structures  
designed by the allowable stress design provisions would be designed by either the allowable  
stress design load combinations of ASCE 7 or the alternative load combinations prescribed in  
Section 1605.2 of the IBC.  
2107.2 TMS 402, Section 6.1.6.1.1, lap splices. This modification allows the reinforcing-bar lap  
splice lengths to be consistent for all masonry design methods \(allowable stress design and  
strength design\). It is a permissible alternative to the lap splice length in TMS 402. The splice  
lengths in TMS 402 are based on developing the allowable stress in the bar by means of an  
assumed simplified bond mechanism, which is not conservative for large bar sizes.  
Both allowable stress and strength design methods assume that the reinforcing will have  
sufficient strength to resist the imposed forces. Splices of reinforcing bars must meet this same  
strength test; the same holds true for development length. In seismic regions, the force in any  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationparticular bar is indeterminate but may be at the yield strength of the bar. Required development  
and splice lengths are based on developing the yield strength of the reinforcing bar, including  
any apparent overstrength, without distress in the masonry, as is done in the strength design  
method.  
The splice length or development length required by the IBC equation, including the fs factor,  
will develop 125 percent of the specified yield strength of the reinforcing bar. This allows for the  
likely overstrength of reinforcing bars and matches the requirements for welded or mechanical  
splices, which also must develop 125 percent of the specified yield strength of the bar. The IBC  
also increases lap splices by 50 percent in areas of high tensile demand \(greater than 80 percent  
of the allowable steel tension stress, Fs\).  
The amendment in Section 2107.2 is only for lap splices. Although the same length is also  
needed to develop the reinforcing bar strength, the requirement for development length in TMS  
402 is not amended in the IBC.  
2107.3 TMS 402, Section 6.1.6.1, splices of reinforcement. The amendment to the standard is  
the requirement that bars larger than No. 9 \(M \#29\) be spliced using mechanical connectors. The  
reason for the amendment is that the allowable stress design method of the standard allows  
reinforcing bar sizes up to No. 11 \(M \#36\). As noted in Section 2107.3, these large bar sizes are  
very difficult to lap splice without splitting the masonry. Using mechanical connectors can  
mitigate the splitting problem that occurs in ordinary lap splices. Hence, the code requires  
mechanical connectors for bar sizes larger than No. 9 \(M \#29\). TMS 402 Section 6.1.6.1.3  
requires mechanical splices to develop 1.25 times the bar yield strength. Welded splices must be  
ASTM A706 steel reinforcement.  
Section 2108 Strength Design of Masonry  
Section 2108 of the IBC references Chapter 9 of TMS 402, but also includes some modifications  
to those provisions.  
2108.1 General. The IBC references general design requirements in Chapters 1 through 7 and  
the strength design procedure in Chapter 9 of TMS 402 with two modifications. The exception  
for strength design of AAC masonry indicates that AAC masonry must comply with the design  
requirements in Chapters 1 through 7 and 11 of TMS 402.  
2108.2 TMS 402, Section 6.1.5.1.1, development. The required development length of  
reinforcement is determined by Equation 6-1 of the standard but cannot be less than 12 inches  
\(305 mm\). The development length shall be increased by 50 percent for epoxy-coated bars.  
2108.3 TMS 402, Section 6.1.6, splices. Welded splices are not permitted in plastic hinge zones  
of intermediate or special reinforced masonry shear walls. Wherever used, welded splices must  
be of ASTM A706 \(weldable\) steel reinforcement. To achieve adequate performance, splices in  
reinforcing used in the seismic-force-resisting system that are subjected to high seismic strains  
must be capable of developing the full strength of the reinforcing steel. In order to be welded  
properly, the chemistry of the steel must have a limited carbon content as well as other elements  
such as sulfur and phosphorus. If the chemistry of the steel is not carefully controlled, the  
welding procedures in AWS D1.4, which are based on the steel chemistry, must be carefully  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationadhered to in order to produce welds that develop the strength of the steel. If the carbon  
equivalent or the sulfur or phosphorus content is too high, the steel may not be weldable.  
Because the chemistry of reinforcing steel conforming to ASTM A615, A616, and A617 is not  
controlled and is often unknown, a quality weld that can adequately develop the strength of the  
steel is not always possible. In contrast, ASTM A706 steel has controlled chemistry and is  
always weldable. Welded splices are required to be able to develop only 125 percent of the  
specified yield strength of the spliced bars. However, because A615, A616, A617, as well as  
A706 bars can have actual yield strengths in excess of 125 percent of the specified yield strength,  
a code-conforming welded splice may fail before the spliced bars can yield. This would  
compromise the inelastic deformability of a structural member. Therefore, welded splices are  
prohibited within the potential plastic hinge region of members in structural systems in buildings  
assigned to the higher seismic design categories.  
Type 1 mechanical splices are not permitted to be used within a plastic hinge zone or within a  
beam-column joint of intermediate or special reinforced masonry shear walls, because Type 1  
splices may not be able to resist the stress levels that develop within the yielding region.  
However, Type 2 mechanical splices are permitted in any location within a member because  
Type 2 splices are required to develop the specified tensile strength of the spliced bars. ACI  
recommends that good detailing preclude the use of splices within regions subjected to potential  
yielding. However, if splices cannot be avoided, the designer should investigate and document  
the force-deformation characteristics of the spliced bar and the ability of the splice to meet the  
expected inelastic demand. See ACI 318 for discussion of the types of mechanical splices.  
Section 2109 Empirical Design of Adobe Masonry  
The empirical design procedure for adobe masonry is a prescriptive method of sizing and  
proportioning masonry structures using rules and formulas that were developed over many years.  
The procedure is based on experience and predates the engineering design methods. The  
empirical method was developed for use in smaller buildings with more interior walls and stiffer  
floor systems than are commonly built today. Gravity loads are assumed to be approximately  
centered on bearing walls and foundation piers, and the effects of reinforcement are neglected.  
2109.1 General. Adobe construction is defined in Section 202 and is designed and constructed  
according to the empirical method in Appendix A of TMS 402 and the specific requirements  
given in Section 2109.2. From a fire- and life-safety standpoint, adobe construction must meet  
the requirements for Type V construction specified in Chapter 6.  
2109.1.1 Limitations. The limitations are given in Section A.1.2 of TMS 402. Empirical design  
is not permitted in buildings in Seismic Design Category D, E, or F and cannot be used for the  
seismic-force-resisting system in Seismic Design Category B or C. Where empirically designed  
masonry walls are used in the lateral-load-resisting system \(wind or seismic\), the height of the  
building is limited to 35 feet \(10,688 mm\). See Table A.1.1 of TMS 402 for limitations based on  
building height and wind speed. The empirical design method cannot be used to design or  
construct masonry buildings or parts of masonry buildings located in areas where the allowable  
stress design wind speed \(Vasd\) determined in accordance with Section 1609.3.1 exceeds 110  
mph \(49 m/s\). If a building structure exceeds the limitations prescribed in this section or the  
standard, then the building or structure must be designed in accordance with the engineering  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationprovisions covered in Section 2101.2. Masonry foundation walls may be constructed in  
accordance with the prescriptive masonry foundation wall provisions covered in Section  
1807.1.6.  
Section A.1.1.2 prohibits the use of empirical design for AAC masonry, which must be  
designed in accordance with the strength design procedure in TMS 402, by not referencing the  
material for design. Concrete, clay, and stone masonry may be used with empirical design.  
Section 2110 Glass Unit Masonry  
This section covers the empirical requirements for nonload-bearing glass unit masonry elements  
used in exterior or interior walls. Glass unit masonry is not permitted to be used in various types  
of fire-resistive walls, smoke barriers, or load-bearing walls. See further discussion in the  
International Building Code Commentary. Glass unit masonry is designed and constructed  
according to Chapter 13 of TMS 402 and the specific requirements in Section 2110.  
Section 2111 Masonry Fireplaces  
This section covers requirements for masonry fireplaces and their foundations constructed of  
concrete or masonry. Note that Section 2111 covers requirements for masonry fireplaces, not  
masonry chimneys. Specific requirements for masonry chimneys are covered in Section 2113.  
The IBC requires concrete and masonry fireplaces to have both seismic reinforcement and  
seismic anchorage depending on the seismic design category of the structure. In Seismic Design  
Category A or B, no seismic reinforcement is required. In Seismic Design Category C or D,  
prescriptive reinforcement and anchorage is provided in Sections 2111.4.1, 2111.4.2, and 2111.5.  
In Seismic Design Category E or F, the reinforcement and anchorage must be designed in  
accordance with the engineering requirements of Sections 2101 through 2108, which generally  
references provisions in TMS 402.  
Section 2112 Masonry Heaters  
This section covers requirements for masonry heaters as defined in Section 2112.1. This is  
possibly the only definition that still remains in the body of the code and not in Chapter 2.  
Seismic anchorage and reinforcing is only required in masonry heaters in Seismic Design  
Categories D, E, and F. The section references Section 2113 for anchorage and reinforcing.  
Section 2113 Masonry Chimneys  
This section applies to masonry chimneys constructed of concrete or masonry. The section  
covers seismic anchorage and reinforcing, footing support, and general construction  
requirements for masonry chimneys. The IBC requires concrete and masonry chimneys to have  
both seismic reinforcement and seismic anchorage depending on the seismic design category of  
the structure. In Seismic Design Category A or B, no seismic reinforcement is required. In  
Seismic Design Category C or D, prescriptive reinforcement and anchorage is provided in  
Sections 2113.3.1, 2113.3.2, and 2113.4. In Seismic Design Category E or F, the reinforcement  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand anchorage must be designed in accordance with the engineering requirements of Sections  
2101 through 2108, which generally references provisions in TMS 402.  
Section 2114 Dry-Stack Masonry  
This section limits the use of dry-stack masonry to Risk Category I through III structures and  
requires the use of concrete masonry units. The design must comply with TMS 402 but shall not  
exceed the maximum allowable stresses provided in Table 2114.4.  
KEY POINTS  
• Chapter 21 contains requirements for the design and construction of masonry buildings  
and other masonry structures regulated by the IBC.  
• The 2021 IBC references the 2016 edition of TMS 402 Building Code Requirements for  
Masonry Structures, and TMS 602 Specification for Masonry Structures, and in many  
cases, the IBC refers to specific chapters in the standard for detailed design and  
construction requirements.  
• Masonry structures may be designed by one of the procedures prescribed in Section  
2101.2 for allowable stress design, strength design, prestressed masonry design,  
empirical design, or the direct design procedure in accordance with TMS 403.  
• Allowable stress designed, strength designed, AAC, prestressed, and empirically  
designed masonry must also meet the applicable seismic design requirements of  
Section 2106, which references Chapter 7 of TMS 402. Seismic requirements are based  
on the seismic design category of the structure.  
• Glass unit masonry may be designed by provisions in Section 2110 of the code and  
Chapter 13 of TMS 402.  
• Masonry veneer must comply with provisions in Chapter 14 of the code and Chapter 12  
of TMS 402.  
• TMS 402 contains specific requirements for construction documents pertaining to  
masonry structures.  
• Masonry materials must comply with the requirements and applicable ASTM and other  
standards referenced in Section 2103.  
• Masonry construction methods must comply with the requirements in Section 2104,  
which references various provisions in TMS 602 or TMS 604.  
• A quality-assurance program in accordance with Section 2105 and Chapter 17 is  
required for masonry structures to ensure that constructed masonry is in conformance  
with the construction documents.  
• Chapter 17 references the quality-assurance provisions in TMS 602, which are based on  
the risk category of the structure.  
• Requirements for masonry fireplaces and chimneys including specific seismic  
reinforcing and anchorage based on seismic design category are provided in Sections  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2111 and 2113, respectively.  
• Reinforcement and anchorage of masonry fireplaces and chimneys in structures in  
Seismic Design Categories E and F must be designed in accordance with the  
engineering provisions of Chapter 21 and TMS 402.

Key Points  
This chapter provides a roadmap to the various design standards that apply to design and  
construction of steel structures. Sections 2202 and 2203 deal with identification and protection  
of structural steel, respectively, and 2204 covers connections. Sections 2205 through 2211  
contain references to standards for structural steel, composite steel and concrete, steel joists,  
steel cable structures, steel storage racks, and cold-formed steel  
Section 2201 General  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2201.1 Scope. Chapter 22 covers requirements for the quality, design, fabrication, and  
construction of steel structures including structural steel, cold-formed steel, steel bar joists, steel  
cable structures, and steel storage racks.  
Section 2202 Identification of Steel for Structural  
# Purposes  
All structural steel used for load-carrying purposes must be properly identified in order to  
determine conformance with the appropriate specification and grade. Structural steel must be  
identified in accordance with the American Institute of Steel Construction’s AISC 360,  
Specification for Structural Steel Buildings. Chapter N of AISC 360 addresses minimum  
requirements for quality control, quality assurance, and nondestructive testing for structural steel  
systems and steel elements of composite members for buildings and other structures. Section N2  
requires material identification procedures to comply with the requirements of Section 6.1 of the  
AISC Code of Standard Practice for Structural Steel Buildings and Bridges \(AISC 303\), and be  
monitored by the fabricator’s quality control inspector \(QCI\).  
The identification of cold-formed steel members should be in accordance with the  
requirements of American Iron and Steel Institute’s AISI S100, North American Specification for  
the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members. Section A of AISI S100 addresses the  
identification of cold-formed steel. Cold-formed steel used in light-frame construction should be  
identified in accordance with the additional requirements of AISI S240, North American  
Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Framing for structural members or S220, North  
American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Nonstructural Framing for nonstructural members.  
Other types of steel must be identified in accordance with the applicable ASTM standard or other  
standard referenced in this chapter. The code requires unidentified steel to be tested for  
conformity to the applicable standard.  
Section 2203 Protection of Steel for Structural Purposes  
Protection of structural steel and cold-formed steel structural members or panels from corrosion  
is required. Protection may be by painting or galvanizing. Painting of structural steel is required  
to comply with the requirements of AISC 360. Painting steel joists must comply with the  
appropriate Steel Joist Institute \(SJI\) standard for the particular type of joist or girder. Protection  
of cold-formed steel members should be in accordance with the general requirements of AISI  
S100, Section B, which addresses the protection of cold-formed steel from corrosion. Cold-  
formed steel in light-frame construction should be protected in accordance with the additional  
requirements of AISI S240 or AISI S220, as applicable.  
Section 2204 Connections  
This section references the subsections that apply to the various types of steel for welding,  
bolting, and anchor rods.  
2204.1 Welding. This section does not directly reference American Welding Society \(AWS\)  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstructural welding codes. Rather, it requires that welding be performed in accordance with the  
applicable steel specification referenced in Section 2205 for structural steel, Section 2206 for  
composite structural steel and concrete structures, Section 2207 for steel joists, Section 2208 for  
steel cable structures, Section 2210 for cold-formed steel, and Section 2211 for cold-formed steel  
in light-frame construction. This is done because the various referenced standards either  
reference different editions of an AWS specification, reference a specific AWS specification, or  
the referenced standard includes its own welding requirements such as in the SJI standards.  
The IBC® references AISC 360 and AISC 341, Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel  
Buildings which both reference AWS D1.1, Structural Welding Code—Steel. Special inspection  
of welding is required as specified in Section 1705. As noted in the discussion of Chapter 17,  
Section 1705.2.1 references the quality-assurance and inspection provisions in AISC 360.  
Section N5.4 and Tables N5.4-1 through N5.4-3 of AISC 360 contain quality-assurance and  
inspection requirements for structural steel welding in buildings. It should be noted that the  
terminology used in the AISC quality-assurance provisions differ from Chapter 17 of the IBC.  
Most notably the terms “special inspection,  
” “continuous,  
” and “periodic” are not used. In AISC  
360, the term “quality control” refers to tasks performed by the steel fabricator and erector to  
verify the quality of construction. The term “quality assurance” refers to inspection tasks  
performed by organizations other than the steel fabricator and erector such as the project owner’s  
representative, and are intended to ensure that the product meets the project requirements. The  
terms quality assurance inspector \(QAI\) and quality control inspector \(QCI\) are defined in the  
standard. Thus, QAI refers to the special inspector as defined in the building code. Chapter N of  
AISC 360 also defines two inspection levels as either “observe” or “perform” in contrast to the  
building code, which uses the terms “periodic” or “continuous.  
” Section 1705.2 covers special  
inspection requirements for structural steel \(AISC 360\), cold-formed steel decks \(SDI QA/QC\),  
and open-web steel joists and joist girders.  
2204.2 Bolting. The philosophy of this section is similar to that used for welding requirements,  
in as much as the design standards reference different editions of the bolting standards. Bolting  
standards are not referenced directly in the code itself, but are referenced in the particular design  
standard. The applicable standards are referenced in Section 2205 for structural steel, Section  
2206 for composite structural steel and concrete structures, Section 2207 for steel joists, Section  
2210 for cold-formed steel, and Section 2211 for cold-formed steel light-frame construction.  
As noted, the IBC references AISC 360 and AISC 341, both of which reference the Research  
Council on Structural Connections \(RSCS\) Specification for Structural Joints Using High-  
Strength Bolts.  
The requirements for special inspection of the installation of high-strength bolts are no longer  
provided in Chapter 17 of the IBC. Section N5.6 and Tables N5.6-1 through N5.6-3 of AISC 360  
contain quality-assurance and inspection requirements for high-strength bolting in structural steel  
buildings. High-strength bolting must be installed in accordance with the approved construction  
documents and the RCSC specification. Special inspection is required for installation and  
tightening of high-strength bolts regardless of the tightening method, or whether the bolts are slip  
critical or snug-tight connections. The only case where special inspection may not be required is  
where the connections are designed to use ordinary mild steel \(ASTM A307\) bolts but the  
engineer specifies high-strength bolts to be installed.  
As noted above, the terminology used in the AISC quality-assurance provisions differ from  
Chapter 17 of the IBC. Most notably, the terms “special inspection,  
” “continuous,  
” and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation“periodic” are not used. The terms QAI and QCI are defined in the standard.  
“QAI” refers to the  
special inspector as defined in the building code. Chapter N of AISC 360 also defines two  
inspection levels as either “observe” or “perform” rather than “periodic” or “continuous.  
” For  
example, turn-of-nut installation with matchmarking, installation using twist-off bolts, and  
installation using direct tension indicators provide visual evidence of a completed installation,  
therefore “periodic” special inspection is permitted for these methods. In this case, Chapter N  
states,  
“The QCI and QAI need not be present during the installation of fasteners when these  
methods are used by the installer.  
” On the other hand, calibrated wrench installation provides no  
such visual evidence and therefore “continuous” special inspection is required, and the inspector  
needs to be on site during installation. In this case, Chapter N states,  
“The QCI and QAI shall be  
engaged in their assigned inspection duties during installation of fasteners when these methods  
are used by the installer.  
” Refer to the Commentary to Chapter N of AISC 360 for more detail.  
2204.3 Anchor rods. Anchor rods must be set in accordance with the approved construction  
documents. The code specifies the bolt protrusion such that all of the threads of the nut are fully  
engaged but the end of the threaded portion does extend beyond the surface of the connected part  
so the nut does not run out of threads. The most common specification for anchor rods is ASTM  
F1554 Standard Specification for Anchor Bolts, Steel, 36, 55, and 105-ksi Yield Strength. The  
standard covers straight and bent, headed and headless anchor bolts \(also known as anchor rods\)  
made of carbon, carbon boron, alloy, or high-strength low-alloy steel, and having specified yield  
strengths of 36, 55, and 105 ksi \(248, 379 and 724 MPa\). The anchor bolts are furnished in two  
thread classes, and in various sizes, and are intended for anchoring structural supports to concrete  
foundations. AISC 360 requires threads on anchor rods to conform to ASME B 18.2.6 Fasteners  
for Use in Structural Applications.  
Section 2205 Structural Steel  
Section 202 defines structural steel elements as any steel structural member of a building or  
structure consisting of a rolled steel structural shape other than cold-formed steel, or steel joist  
members.  
2205.1 General. Structural steel buildings must be designed, fabricated, and constructed in  
accordance with the referenced standard, ANSI/AISC 360. AISC 360 is an ANSI-approved  
standard that provides requirements for the design and construction of structural steel buildings  
and other structures, and incorporates both allowable strength design, and load and resistance  
factor design methods. The dual-units format provides both U.S. customary and SI units. In  
addition to AISC 360, AISC publishes the Steel Construction Manual. The manual contains the  
following\: AISC 360 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, RCSC Specification for  
Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts, and AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel  
Buildings and Bridges.  
2205.2 Seismic design. The IBC references ANSI/AISC 341, Seismic Provisions for Structural  
Steel Buildings. AISC 341 contains an extensive commentary and bibliography. The ANSI-  
approved specification is a companion to ANSI/AISC 360 that extends coverage to the  
connection detailing and member design requirements for structural steel and composite systems  
in high-seismic applications.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIn addition to the seismic design standard, AISC publishes the Seismic Design Manual. The  
AISC Seismic Design Manual includes AISC 341 and AISC 358, Prequalified Connections for  
Special and Intermediate Steel Moment Frames for Seismic Applications. AISC 358 covers  
prequalified steel moment connections in intermediate and special moment frames and is also a  
referenced standard in the IBC.  
Requirements for design of structural steel structures resisting seismic forces are based on the  
seismic design category of the building as determined from Section 1613.2.5. Requirements for  
Seismic Design Categories B and C are given in Section 2205.2.1.1, and requirements for  
Seismic Design Categories D, E, and F are given in Section 2205.2.1.2. For a detailed discussion  
on determination of seismic design category, see discussion of Section 1613.  
2205.2.1.1 Seismic design category B or C. All structures in Seismic Design Category A need  
only comply with the general structural integrity requirements prescribed in Section 1.4 of ASCE  
7, which is referenced from ASCE 7 Section 11.7. Steel structures assigned to Seismic Design  
Category B or C may be of any construction permitted in Section 2205. Where a structure is  
designed using a Response Modification Factor, R, from Table 12.2-1 of ASCE 7, the structure  
must be designed and detailed in accordance with AISC 341. The exception allows structures  
assigned to Seismic Design Category B or C to be designed as “steel systems not specifically  
detailed for seismic resistance” using an R-factor of 3 using AISC 360 and not AISC 341. See  
Item H of Table 12.2-1 of ASCE 7. It should be noted that this category does not include  
cantilever column systems, which are specifically covered under Item G in ASCE 7 Table 12.2-  
1\. Although not required, structures in Seismic Design Category B or C may be designed and  
detailed in accordance with AISC 341 using the appropriate R-factor from ASCE 7 Table 12.2-1  
or Table 12.14-1 for the type of building system involved. In a sense, this is trading ductile  
detailing for design force level. Using systems with higher R values produces lower lateral forces  
but requires more ductile detailing to ensure ductile response characteristics. In general, detailing  
requirements can have a significant impact on construction cost of the seismic-force-resisting  
system; therefore, providing the required detailing in order to design for lower lateral forces may  
not be economical in lower seismic design categories.  
The IBC clarifies that beam-to-column moment connections that are part of a “special” or  
“intermediate” moment frame are required to be prequalified, or qualified by testing, in  
accordance with AISC 341 or to be prequalified as prescribed in AISC 358. This provision also  
applies to seismic design categories D through F.  
2205.2.1.2 Seismic design category D, E, or F. Unlike structural steel systems in Seismic  
Design Category A, B, or C, steel structures in Seismic Design Category D, E, or F are required  
to be designed and detailed in accordance with AISC 341 using the appropriate R-factor from  
ASCE 7 Table 12.2-1 or Table 12.14-1 for the building type and seismic-force-resisting system  
involved. Note that ASCE 7 Table 15.4-1 contains specific detailing for nonbuilding structures  
similar to buildings. See Section 2205.2.1.1 for discussion of beam-to-column moment  
connections for special and intermediate moment frames.  
2205.2.2 Structural steel elements. This section covers design and construction of steel  
elements in nonsteel seismic-force-resisting systems, such as chords, collectors, and foundation  
elements. These elements must be designed in accordance with AISC 341 where\: \(1\) the  
structure is in Seismic Design Category D, E, or F, \(2\) part of nonbuilding structures similar to  
buildings designed in accordance with ASCE 7 Table 15.4-1, or \(3\) the structure is in Seismic  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationDesign Category B or C and an R-factor greater than 3 is used in the design.  
Section 2206 Composite Structural Steel and Concrete  
# Structures  
2206.1 General. The IBC references AISC 360 and ACI 318 \(excluding Chapter 14, Plain  
Concrete\) for the design of composite structural steel and concrete structures. Seismic design of  
composite steel and concrete structures is provided in Section 2206.2.  
2206.2 Seismic design. The design of composite structural steel and concrete systems resisting  
seismic forces based on the appropriate R-factor from ASCE 7 is required to conform to the  
requirements of the AISC 341 and ACI 318 standards. AISC 341 contains detailed provisions for  
testing composite special moment frames, composite partially restrained moment frames, and  
composite eccentrically braced frames. Unlike structural steel structures regulated by Section  
2205, composite structures must be designed and detailed in accordance with AISC 341  
regardless of seismic design category. Structures in Seismic Design Category A may be designed  
in accordance with AISC 360 and need only comply with the general structural integrity  
requirements prescribed in Section 1.4 of ASCE 7, which is referenced from ASCE 7 Section  
11.7.  
Section 2207 Steel Joists  
Steel joists are required to be designed, manufactured, and tested in accordance with the various  
specifications published by the SJI and referenced in Section 2207.1.  
Joists are used primarily as gravity-load-carrying members. When joists are incorporated into  
the lateral-force-resisting system as collectors, chords, and diaphragm ties, care must be taken to  
ensure that the joists are specifically designed and detailed to properly function as intended.  
Normally, joists are designed only for gravity and wind uplift loads. A continuous load path is  
necessary for chords, collectors, and diaphragm ties, and their connections. The typical seat on a  
steel joist is eccentric to the chord and is not ordinarily designed to carry the axial force and  
resulting moment through the seat when functioning as a collector or chord, which are in tension  
and compression. Generally, special seats must be designed and manufactured, or the load path  
must be specifically directed through the chords by direct chord-to-chord connection.  
2207.1 General. The design, manufacture, and installation of open web steel joists and joist  
girders are required to conform to either SJI 200, Standard Specifications, Weight Tables and  
Bridging Tables for CJ-Series Composite Steel Joists or SJI 100, Standard Specifications, Load  
Tables and Weight Tables for K-Series, LH-Series, DLH-Series and Joist Girders. Additionally,  
seismic design must be in accordance with the provisions of Section 2205 or Section 2211 for  
light-frame cold-formed steel construction.  
2207.2 Design. This section requires the registered design professional to indicate on the  
construction documents the steel joist or joist girder designations used as well as layout scheme,  
end support, anchorages, bridging, bridging termination connections, and bearing connections  
that resist uplift and lateral loads. The construction documents must also include any special  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationloads or conditions that are listed in the code section. The construction documents are part of the  
submittal documents required by Section 107. See Section 202 for the definition of construction  
documents.  
2207.3 Calculations. The steel joist/girder manufacturer is required to design the steel joists  
and/or steel joist girders to support the anticipated loads and load combinations prescribed by  
Chapter 16 in accordance with the applicable SJI specifications. The registered design  
professional responsible for the design of the building may require joist/girder calculations to be  
prepared along with a cover letter bearing the seal and signature of the joist manufacturer’s  
registered design professional. In addition to the standard steel joist or joist girder calculations,  
other items such as non-SJI standard bridging details, nonstandard connection details, field  
splices, and joist headers are required to be submitted.  
2207.4 Steel joist drawings. Steel joist placement plans that indicate the steel joist products  
specified on the construction documents are required to be submitted to the building department  
for review and approval. Joist placement plans are primarily used to install the joist system in the  
field. This code section is very specific as to what the joist placement plans are required to  
include. Note that the section specifically states that steel joist placement plans do not require the  
seal and signature of the joist manufacturer’s registered design professional.  
2207.5 Certification. The steel joist manufacturer is required to submit a certificate of  
compliance stating that work was performed in accordance with approved construction  
documents and the applicable SJI standard specifications. See also Section 1704.2.5 regarding  
exemption of special inspection where work is done by an approved fabricator. A certificate of  
compliance from the fabricator is required to be submitted to the building official stating that the  
work was performed in accordance with approved construction documents and with SJI standard  
specifications.  
Section 2208 Steel Cable Structures  
2208.1 General. The IBC references ASCE 19, Structural Applications of Steel Cables for  
Buildings, for design and construction of steel cables used in buildings. See the commentary in  
ASCE 19 for a detailed explanation of the structural requirements for cable structures.  
Section 2209 Steel Storage Racks  
In relation to steel storage racks, there are three standards that are referenced in the IBC. The  
first two are developed by the Rack Manufacturer’s Institute and are RMI ANSI/MH 16.1,  
Specification for the Design, Testing and Utilization of Industrial Steel Storage Racks and RMI  
ANSI/MH 16.3, Specification for the Design, Testing and Utilization of Industrial Steel  
Cantilevered Storage Racks.  
Racking systems that do not comply with the specific limitations of the RMI standards must  
be designed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 15 in ASCE 7. ASCE 7 also includes  
revisions to the RMI ANSI/MH 16.1 standard in relation to base plate design and the use of  
shims and to the RMI ANSI/MH 16.3 standard for anchor bolt design.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2209.1 Steel storage racks. The RMI ANSI/MH 16.1 standard applies specifically to industrial  
pallet racks, movable shelf racks, and stacker racks made of cold-formed or hot-rolled steel  
structural members. This standard does not apply to cantilever racks, portable racks, drive-in or  
drive-through racks, or racks made of materials other than structural steel.  
2209.2 Steel cantilevered storage racks. RMI ANSI/MH 16.3 provides design, construction,  
use, and behavior of cantilevered storage racks with supporting commentary. The behavior of  
these types of racking systems is significantly different from standard pallet storage racks.  
Figures 2209-1 and 2209-2 provide a visual comparison of a standard pallet rack and a  
cantilevered storage rack.

2209.3 Certification. This section requires that racks whose top load level is at 8 feet or more be  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcertified. The installer must provide the owner, or the owner’s authorized agent, with a certificate  
of compliance once installation has been completed. This certificate of compliance must note  
that the racking provided, and installation, conform to the approved construction documents.  
Section 2210 Cold-Formed Steel  
2210.1 General. The term “cold-formed steel construction” is defined in Section 202. This  
section references the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel  
Structural Members \(AISI S100-16\) with Supplement 2 \(2020\). AISI S100 is also known as the  
“North American Specification” and harmonizes cold-formed steel design across the United  
States, Canada, and Mexico. Chapters A through M and Appendices 1 and 2 comprise the main  
portion of the document, while Appendix A is specific to the United States and Mexico and  
Appendix B is specific to Canada.  
Cold-formed stainless steel structural systems are required to be designed in accordance with  
ASCE 8, Standard Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Stainless Steel Structural  
Members.  
Where required by ASCE 7, seismic design of cold-formed steel structures must be in  
accordance with Section 2210.2, which references AISI S100 and ASCE 8. The section  
references AISI S400 for design of cold-formed steel special-bolted moment frames \(see Section  
2210.2 discussion\).  
2210.1.1 Steel decks. The section covers design and construction of cold-formed steel floor and  
roof decks. Rather than following the formal approach for the design of cold-formed structural  
members \(AISI S100\), the IBC references the Steel Deck Institute’s \(SDI\) ANSI/SDI NC,  
Standard for Noncomposite Steel Floor Deck, ANSI/SDI RD, Standard for Steel Roof Deck, and  
ANSI/SDI C, Standard for Noncomposite Steel Floor Deck-Slabs.  
2210.1.1.1 Noncomposite steel floor decks. This section references ANSI/SDI NC, which  
governs the materials, design, and erection of cold-formed noncomposite steel deck used as a  
form for reinforced concrete slabs.  
2210.1.1.2 Steel roof decks. This section references ANSI/SDI RD, which governs the  
materials, design, and erection of cold-formed steel deck used for the support of roofing  
materials, design live loads, and construction loads.  
2210.1.1.3 Composite slabs on steel decks. This section references ANSI/SDI C, which governs  
the design and construction of composite concrete slabs and steel decks. It is also important to  
recognize that the IBC Chapter 17 references ANSI/SDI QA/QC for the installation and  
inspection of composite steel floor deck slabs.  
2210.2 Seismic requirements for cold-formed steel structures. Where required by ASCE 7,  
seismic design of cold-formed steel structures is to be in accordance with AISI S100 and ASCE  
8\. The section references AISI S400 which includes design provisions for cold-formed steel  
seismic force-resisting systems called cold-formed steel special-bolted moment frames \(CFS-  
SBMF\). CFS-SBMF systems experience substantial inelastic deformation during a design  
seismic event, with most of the inelastic deformation occurring at the bolted connections due to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationslip and bearing \(See Figure 2210-1\). Cyclic testing has shown that the system has large ductility  
capacity and significant hardening. To develop the expected mechanism, requirements based on  
capacity design principles are provided in the standard for the design of beams, columns, and  
their connections. Table 12.2-1 of ASCE 7 includes seismic design parameters for the CFS-  
SBMF system of R = 3.5, Ω0 = 3.0, and Cd = 3.5\. AISI S400 also includes specific quality  
assurance and quality control procedures.  
Figure 2210-1 Cold-formed steel special-bolted moment frames.  
Section 2211 Cold-Formed Steel Light-Frame  
# Construction  
This section lays out the design and installation requirements for structural and nonstructural  
members used in cold-formed steel light-frame construction where the specified minimum base  
steel thickness is not greater than 0.118 inch \(3.00 mm\).  
The IBC references several AISI standards including AISI S240, North American Standard  
for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Framing; AISI S400, North American Standard for Seismic  
Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Systems; AISI S230, Standard for Cold-Formed Steel  
Framing—Prescriptive Method for One- and Two-Family Dwellings; and AISI S202, Code of  
Standard Practice for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Framing. The AISI S240 standard addresses  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrequirements for construction with cold-formed steel structural framing that are common to  
prescriptive and engineered light-frame construction.  
2211.1 Structural framing. This section requires cold-formed steel light-frame construction to  
comply with the AISI S240 standard as well as Sections 2211.1.1 through 2211.1.3. The code  
also clarifies that these provisions apply to floor and roof systems, structural walls, lateral-force-  
resisting systems, and trusses.  
2211.1.1 Seismic requirements for cold-formed steel structural systems. This section  
distinguishes the design requirements for cold-formed light-frame construction for Seismic  
Design Categories B and C separately from the requirements for Seismic Design Categories D  
through F. In both instances the design is required to conform to the AISI S400 standard,  
although for Seismic Design Categories B and C an exception is provided allowing the design to  
simply conform to AISI S240 if the seismic response modification factor \(R=3\) selected in Table  
12.2-1 Line H of ASCE 7 is not specifically detailed for seismic resistance.  
2211.1.2 Prescriptive framing. This section references AISI S230 for the design and  
construction of cold-formed steel framing in detached one- and two-family dwellings and  
townhouses up to three stories in height. This standard incorporates provisions such as the L-  
header and an efficient design procedure for built-up headers.  
2211.1.3 Truss design. This section references AISI S202, and specifically Section I1 which  
addresses the responsibilities of the designer, manufacturer, and contractor for cold-formed steel  
trusses. This section requires that truss drawings be provided and that permanent truss bracing is  
installed in addition to specifying quality assurance requirements during fabrication and special  
inspection of cold-formed steel trusses spanning 60 feet \(18,288 mm\) or more.  
2211.2 Nonstructural members. This section clarifies that nonstructural members are to be  
designed in accordance with AISI S220. In Section 2211.1, structural members are defined as  
floor and roof systems, structural walls, lateral-force-resisting systems, and trusses.  
Nonstructural members could consist of nonbearing walls, ceiling framing, bracing, or blocking  
members, etc.

referenced in Section 2309 also without amendment  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 2301 General  
2301.1 Scope. Chapter 23 covers materials, design, construction, and quality of wood buildings  
and structures. The structural wood products addressed in this chapter include sawn lumber,  
glued-laminated timber, cross-laminated timber, wood structural panels, particleboard,  
fiberboard, hardboard, prefabricated wood I-joists, structural composite lumber, structural logs,  
round timber poles and piles, and engineered wood rim joists. Provisions for preservative-treated  
and fire-retardant-treated wood are also included. The chapter additionally contains material  
specifications, quality requirements, and design provisions, as well as empirical and prescriptive  
provisions for conventional wood-frame construction.  
2301.2 Nominal sizes. Nominal lumber sizes, for example, 2 inches by 4 inches, are the sizes  
usually referred to in this chapter. However, actual or net dimensions, smaller than nominal  
dimensions, are used in structural calculations to determine member section properties, actual  
stresses, and strength properties. The nominal and actual sizes of dimension lumber are  
established by Department of Commerce \(DOC\) Voluntary Product Standard PS 20, American  
Softwood Lumber Standard. The PS 20 standard is available from the National Institute of  
Standards and Technology \(NIST\). The nominal size, dressed size, and section properties for  
sawn lumber and glued-laminated timber are given in Tables 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D of the NDS  
Supplement. See Section 202 for the definition of nominal size lumber.  
Section 202 Definitions  
The specific terms related to wood construction are defined in Section 202 to clarify their  
meaning. Many of the terms clarify elements of the lateral-force-resisting systems.  
Some specific terms are discussed below.  
COLLECTOR. A collector accumulates shear from the \(floor or roof\) diaphragm and delivers it  
to vertical lateral-force-resisting elements such as shear walls. The term drag strut is a colloquial  
expression that means collector. Collectors can also be used to transfer forces within a  
diaphragm. The IBC® recognizes both horizontal and sloped \(or nearly horizontal\) diaphragms  
and as such the definition of collector applies to both horizontal and sloped diaphragms. The  
word horizontal was used to differentiate diaphragms from vertical lateral-force-resisting  
elements such as shear walls.  
CONVENTIONAL LIGHT-FRAME CONSTRUCTION. A type of construction whose  
primary structural elements such as walls, floors, and roofs are formed by repetitive wood-  
framing members constructed in accordance with Section 2308.  
CROSS-LAMINATED TIMBER. A prefabricated engineered wood product first developed in  
Europe, cross-laminated timber \(CLT\) has been used extensively as large-section structural  
timber. A North American product manufacturing standard, ANSI/APA PRG 320, Standard for  
Performance-Rated Cross-Laminated Timber, provides requirements and test methods for  
qualification and quality assurance for CLT which is manufactured from solid-sawn lumber or  
structural composite lumber.  
DIAPHRAGM, UNBLOCKED. A diaphragm is a horizontal or nearly horizontal \(sloped\)  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstructural element that transmits lateral forces to vertical elements \(shear walls or frames\) of the  
lateral-force-resisting system. An unblocked diaphragm has edge nailing at supported edges  
only. In an unblocked diaphragm, panel edges are unblocked between supporting structural  
members. In a blocked diaphragm, all sheathing panel edges are supported by framing members  
or solid blocking members. Blocked diaphragms have continuity between the sheathing panel  
edges and therefore have significantly less deflection than unblocked diaphragms because of the  
stiffness developed by the continuity at blocked panel edges.  
It is important to note that the definition of diaphragm also includes horizontal bracing  
systems.  
In terms of distribution of seismic or wind forces, the stiffness of the diaphragm relative to the  
stiffness of the vertical lateral-force-resisting elements \(shear walls or frames\) is the important  
parameter by which to classify a diaphragm. Diaphragms can be flexible, rigid, or semi-rigid.  
Refer to the discussion of ASCE 7 Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings  
and Other Structures Section 12.3 for additional information on diaphragm classifications.  
ENGINEERED RIM BOARD. Engineered rim board is an important structural element in  
many engineered wood floor applications where both structural load path through the perimeter  
member and dimensional change compatibility are important design considerations. Two  
standards address products intended for engineered wood rim board applications. Both  
ANSI/APA PRR 410 and ASTM D7672 address the fundamental requirements for testing and  
evaluation of engineered rim boards. ASTM D7672 is applicable to determination of product-  
specific rim board performance \(i.e., structural capacities\) for engineered wood products that  
may be recognized in manufacturer’s product evaluation reports. The PRR 410 standard also  
includes performance categories for engineered wood products used in engineered rim board  
applications. Under PRR 410, products are assigned a grade based on performance category  
\(e.g., categories based on structural capacity\) and bear a mark in accordance with the grade.  
GRADE \(LUMBER\). Referenced Department of Commerce \(DOC\) standard PS 20, American  
Softwood Lumber Standard establishes standard sizes and requirements for development and  
coordination of the lumber grades of various species, assignment of design values when called  
for, and development of grading rules applicable to each species. The PS 20 standard is available  
from the National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\), which administers the  
Department of Commerce Voluntary Product Standards program or the American Lumber  
Standards Committee website at www.alsc.org.  
NATURALLY DURABLE WOOD. Naturally durable wood is the heartwood of a durable  
listed species. Naturally durable wood includes decay-resistant woods, which are redwood,  
cedar, black locust, and black walnut, and termite-resistant woods, including redwood, Alaska  
yellow cedar, Eastern red cedar and Western red cedar. Alaska yellow cedar and Western red  
cedar were determined to be termite resistant in a study involving the Formosan subterranean  
termite. Note that the heartwood of all listed species are both decay and termite-resistant except  
black locust and black walnut. The latter are not termite-resistant.  
PERFORMANCE CATEGORY. The term “performance category” reflects DOC PS 1 and PS  
2 standards, which use terminologies of bond classification to reference glue type and  
performance categories for thickness tolerances consistent with IBC nominal panel thicknesses.  
The performance category value is the “nominal panel thickness” or “panel thickness.  
” See  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSection 2303.1.5.  
PREFABRICATED WOOD I-JOIST. Structural members manufactured of sawn or structural  
composite lumber flanges and wood structural panel webs bonded together with exterior  
exposure adhesives in the form of an “I” cross-sectional shape.  
SHEAR WALL. A shear wall is a vertical lateral-force-resisting element that is designed to  
resist lateral seismic and wind forces parallel to the plane of a wall. A perforated shear wall is a  
wood structural panel sheathed wall with openings that has not been specifically designed and  
detailed for force transfer around the openings. Perforated shear wall segments are sections of the  
shear wall with full-height sheathing that meet the height-to-width ratio limits specified in  
SDPWS.  
STRUCTURAL COMPOSITE LUMBER. Examples of structural composite lumber \(SCL\)  
include laminated veneer lumber \(LVL\), which is composed of thin wood veneer sheet elements;  
and laminated strand lumber \(LSL\), oriented strand lumber \(OSL\), and parallel strand lumber  
\(PSL\), which are composed of wood strand elements. LVL is the most widely used SCL product.  
SCL wood fibers are primarily oriented along the member length.  
TREATED WOOD. Includes both fire-retardant-treated wood and wood treated to resist decay  
and termites. Treated wood is a general term with two specific types defined\: fire-retardant-  
treated wood \(FRTW\) and preservative-treated wood. The ability of the wood to extinguish itself  
once the source of ignition is consumed or removed is an important element of FRTW. Details  
for preservative treated lumber are found in Section 2303.1.9. Section 2303.2 requires testing of  
fire-retardant-treated wood. The test must be continued 20 minutes beyond the 10 minutes  
required to establish the flame spread without any significant progressive combustion.  
Preservative-treated wood reduces susceptibility to fungi, insects, and marine borers.  
WOOD STRUCTURAL PANEL. Wood structural panels are manufactured from veneers,  
wood strands, or wafers, or a combination thereof, bonded together with waterproof synthetic  
resins. When used for structural purposes such as siding, roof and wall sheathing, subflooring,  
diaphragms, and built-up members, wood structural panels must conform to the requirements in  
DOC PS 1 or PS 2. DOC PS 1 covers plywood and DOC PS 2 covers all other wood-based  
structural panels. DOC Voluntary Product Standards are developed under procedures published  
by the Department of Commerce in Title 15 Code of Federal Regulations Part 10. The purpose of  
these standards is to establish nationally recognized requirements for products and to provide all  
concerned interests with a basis for common understanding of the characteristics of the products.  
The National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) administers the Voluntary Product  
Standards program. The DOC PS 1 and PS 2 standards are available from the NIST global  
standards information program website at www.gsi.nist.gov.  
Section 2302 Design Requirements  
Section 2302 lists sections of Chapter 23 applicable to each type of engineered design and  
prescriptive provisions. Reference is also made to the Wood Frame Construction Manual and  
ICC-400, Design and Construction of Log Structures.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 2303 Minimum Standards and Quality  
2303.1 General. Structural lumber, wood structural panels, and other wood products vary in  
strength and other mechanical properties. The code requires that these materials \(defined in the  
first paragraph of this section\) conform to their respective standards and grading rules specified  
in the code. Furthermore, the code requires that they be identified by a label or be accompanied  
by a certificate of compliance issued by an approved agency. The label is also required to be  
placed on the material by an approved agency \(see labeling—Chapter 17\). The proper use of a  
wood structural member cannot be determined unless it has been properly identified. Counterfeit  
grade stamps, for example, do occasionally appear on lumber in the field, and it is important that  
designers and enforcement personnel be familiar with the approved labels. Examples of labels  
are shown in Figure 2303-1.  
Figure 2303-1 Typical lumber, panel and engineered wood products labels.  
2303.1.1 Sawn lumber. This section references the voluntary product standard, American  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSoftwood Lumber Standard, PS 20, which is available from the American Lumber Standard  
Committee at alsc.org. The NDS references ASTM D1990, ASTM D245, ASTM D2555, the  
Wood Handbook, and PS 20 for the classification, definition, methods of grading, and  
development of design values for lumber. The NDS also references the various standard grading  
rule documents such as NLGA, NELMA, RIS, SPIB, WCLIB, and WWPA.  
2303.1.1.1 Certificate of inspection. Certification is an acceptable alternative to a grade mark  
from both U.S. and Canadian grading agencies certified by the ALSC. The code allows certain  
types of structural lum ber to have a certificate of inspection instead of a grade mark. A certificate  
of inspection is acceptable for precut, remanufactured, or rough-sawn lumber and for sizes larger  
than 3 inches \(76 mm\) nominal in thickness. It is industry practice to place only one label \(grade  
mark\) on a piece of lumber, which may be re moved on precut and remanufactured lumber. Each  
piece of lumber is graded after it has been cut to a standard size. The grade of the piece is  
determined based on its size, number, and location of strength-re ducing characteristics.  
Therefore, one log of timber may pro duce lumber of two or more different grades. It is also  
industry practice not to label lumber having a nominal thickness larger than 3 inches \(76 mm\), or  
rough-sawn material where the label may be illegible. A certificate of inspection from an  
approved agency is acceptable instead of the label for these types of lum ber. The certificate  
should be filed with the permanent records of the building or structure. If defects exceeding those  
permitted for the grade installed are suspected, then a certified grader would be needed to  
determine if the wood is on-grade. To determine if the wood in question is definitely of a suitable  
grade, the grader must inspect all four faces of the piece.  
2303.1.1.2 End-jointed lumber. Approved end-jointed or edge-glued lumber is presumed to be  
equivalent to solid-sawn lumber of the same species and grade. The NDS permits the use of end-  
jointed lumber of the same species and grade. When finger-jointed lumber is marked “STUD  
USE ONLY” or “VERTICAL USE ONLY,  
” such lumber is limited to use where bending or  
tension stresses are of short duration. The use of the term approved is intended to convey the  
need for quality control during the production of these glued products, and also to establish the  
qualification tests for the type of end joint used. Joints are tested for strength and for durability,  
and adhesive manufacturers test their products for durability. Adhesives used in finger-jointed  
lumber are of two basic types, depending on whether they are to be used for members with long-  
duration bending loads like floor joists or short-duration bending and tension loads like wall  
studs. To add elevated-temperature performance requirements for end-jointed lumber adhesives  
intended for use in fire-resistance-rated assemblies, end-jointed lumber manufactured with  
adhesives must meet the new requirements and be designated as “Heat Resistant Adhesive” or  
“HRA” on the grade stamp.  
An example of end-jointed lumber is shown in Figure 2303-2, which illustrates a finger-  
jointed end joint.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2303-2 Finger-jointed end joint.  
2303.1.2 Prefabricated wood I-joists. Wood “I”  
-joists are structural members manufactured of  
sawn or structural composite lumber flanges and wood structural panel webs bonded together  
with exterior exposure adhesives in the form of an “I” cross-sectional shape. The shear, moment,  
and stiffness capacities of prefabricated wood I-joists must be established in accordance with  
ASTM D5055. This standard also specifies that application details, such as bearing length and  
web openings, are to be considered in determining the structural capacity. Wood I-joists are  
structural members typically used in floor and roof construction. The standard requires I-joist  
manufacturers to employ an independent inspection agency to monitor the procedures for quality  
assurance. The standard specifies that proper installation instructions accompany the product to  
the job site. The instructions are required to include weather protection, handling requirements  
and, where required, web reinforcement, connection details, lateral support, bearing details, web  
hole-cutting limitations, and any special conditions.  
2303.1.3 Structural glued-laminated timber. Glued-laminated timbers are manufactured in  
accordance with ANSI A 190.1, which references several other standards. ASTM D3737 is the  
standard method for establishing allowable stresses for glued-laminated timber.  
2303.1.4 Structural glued cross-laminated timber. This section references the manufacturing  
standard ANSI/APA PRG 320 for a wood-based product called Cross-Laminated Timber \(CLT\).  
CLT products were developed in Europe in the 1990s where they have been used extensively as  
large-section structural timber. The North American product manufacturing standard, ANSI/APA  
PRG 320, Standard for Performance-Rated Cross-Laminated Timber, provides requirements and  
test methods for qualification and quality assurance for performance-rated cross-laminated  
timber. CLT products are manufactured from solid-sawn lumber or structural composite lumber.  
Adhesive bonding of wood laminations allows for the manufacture of large wood members.  
Adhesives used for this purpose must meet specified performance criteria at elevated  
temperatures. PRG 320 requires such adhesives to pass a bond line shear test at elevated  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationtemperatures as a demonstration of this performance. In addition, two test protocols are included  
in PRG 320 to ensure adhesives used in CLT will not result in significant delamination and fire  
regrowth. CLT adhesives are required to pass all these tests in order to be qualified under PRG  
320.  
2303.1.5 Wood structural panels. Wood structural panels must conform to the Department of  
Commerce voluntary product standards PS 1 or PS 2. PS 1 is the product standard for  
Construction and Industrial Plywood, and PS 2 is the Performance Standard for Wood-Based  
Structural-Use Panels such as oriented strand board \(OSB\). Wood structural panels include all-  
veneer plywood; composite panels consisting of a combination of veneer and wood-based  
material; and mat-formed panels that contain wood strands only, such as OSB and waferboard.  
The primary distinction between OSB and plywood is that the wood strands in OSB are  
generally oriented in a manner similar to plywood where “mats” of parallel wood fiber are cross-  
laminated prior to pressing. Plywood is defined as panels made by cross laminating three or more  
wood veneers and joining the veneers together with structural adhesives. DOC PS 1 has been  
developed as a guide and specification for the manufacturing of plywood intended for industrial  
and construction uses. DOC PS 2 is a consensus standard that has been developed as a  
specification of product performance for various grades of wood structural panels. Provisions in  
DOC PS 1 and DOC PS 2 define the requirements for structural-grade panels and give the  
requirements for sheathing and single floor-grade wood structural panels.  
ANSI/APA PRP 210 Standard for Performance-Rated Engineered Wood Siding is based on  
APA’s PRP 108 Performance Standards and Qualification Policy for Structural-Use Panels.  
ANSI/APA PRP 210 provides requirements and test methods for qualification and quality  
assurance for performance-rated engineered wood siding intended for use in construction  
applications as exterior siding.  
The term “performance category” is based on the DOC PS 1 and PS 2 standards, which use  
terminologies of bond classification to reference glue type and performance categories to provide  
the thicknesses tolerance consistent with the nominal panel thicknesses in the IBC. The  
performance category value is the “nominal panel thickness” or “panel thickness” both of which  
are used interchangeably throughout the IBC.  
The user is encouraged to obtain the referenced standards for additional technical information  
on wood structural panel products. It must be emphasized that the proper fastening of wood  
structural panels to the supporting structural frame is very important. The nailing schedules  
contained in the code, referenced standards, and the manufacturer’s recommendations must be  
strictly observed for good performance. The correct nail size and spacing is necessary to achieve  
the design strength and performance of the wood structural panel system.  
Wood structural panels manufactured in accordance with DOC PS 1 and DOC PS 2 are  
inspected and labeled to certify compliance by an approved agency. Examples are APA – The  
Engineered Wood Association and PFS TECO. The label identifies the grade and span ratings of  
the product. The inspection agencies maintain a continuous monitoring program designed to  
produce products that meet or exceed the applicable product standard.  
Besides the grades cited above, wood structural panels are also classified by exposure type\:  
Exterior panels are suitable for applications subject to repeated wetting and redrying or  
long-term exposure to weather or other conditions of similar severity.  
Exposure 1 panels are suitable for uses that are not permanently exposed to the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationweather, but where panels must resist effects of moisture due to construction delays,  
high humidity, or other conditions of similar severity. Exposure 1 panels have a fully  
waterproof bond and are made with the same exterior adhesives used in Exterior-rated  
panels.  
Labels applied to certified structural-use panels must include the exposure durability  
classification.  
Plywood is manufactured from more than 70 species of wood, which are divided into five  
groups in accordance with their stiffness and strength characteristics. Construction and  
industrial-panel grades are generally identified under PS 1 in terms of face veneer grade or by a  
name indicating an intended use. The plies may be of any species listed, except for panels  
designated Structural I and other special-use panels, which use only Group I species. The veneer  
grade defines the appearance in terms of natural, unrepaired growth characteristics \(knots\) and  
the number and size of repairs that may be made during manufacturing.  
OSB is manufactured from several species of wood. PS 2 sets forth performance requirements  
in terms of strength, stiffness, and durability. OSB is manufactured to meet the strength,  
stiffness, and durability requirements instead of being manufactured to a prescriptive recipe, as is  
plywood. Table 2303-1 provides an overview of wood structural panel use including grade and  
bond classification, performance category and panel construction \(e.g., OSB and plywood\).  
Table 2303-1. Guide to Wood Structural Panel Use  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2303.1.6 Fiberboard. Fiberboard is a smooth textured panel made up of natural fibers such as  
wood or cane. Fiberboard is used primarily as an insulating board and for decorative purposes,  
but may also be used as wall or roof sheathing under the provisions of this section. Unlike  
particleboard, the cellulosic components of the fiberboard are broken down to individual fibers  
and molded to create the bond between the fibers. Other ingredients may be added during  
processing to provide or improve certain properties such as strength or water resistance, or to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationachieve specific surface finishes for decorative products. Fiberboard is used in most locations  
where panels are necessary, including wall sheathing, insulation of walls and roofs, roof decking,  
doors, and interior finish. Although fiberboard sheathing board may be used for shear walls \[see  
Table 2306.3\(2\)\], fiberboard may not be used for diaphragms. The material is generally labeled  
to indicate an intended use, strength values, and flame resistance where applicable.  
Fiberboard is permitted without any fire-resistance treatment in the walls of all types of  
construction. When used in fire walls and fire separation walls, the fiberboard must be attached  
directly to a noncombustible base and protected by a tight-fitting, noncombustible veneer that is  
fastened through the fiberboard to the base. This will prevent the fiberboard from contributing to  
the spread of fire.  
Fiberboard used in building construction must comply with ASTM C 208, Specification for  
Cellulosic Fiber Insulating Board. For several decades, the fiberboard industry supported  
parallel ASTM and ANSI standards. When used as structural sheathing, fiberboard must be  
identified by an approved agency. See SDPWS Table 4.3A for nominal unit capacities for wood-  
based panel shear walls, including structural fiberboard sheathing.  
2303.1.7 Hardboard. Hardboard is used as exterior siding and in interior locations for paneling  
and underlayment. The code references three Composite Panel Association standards, ANSI  
A135.6, ANSI A135.5, and ANSI A135.4. Manufacturer recommendations for Hardboard  
products are also referenced for installation requirements.  
2303.1.8 Particleboard. Particleboard is a generic term for construction panels and products  
manufactured from cellulosic materials, usually wood, in the form of discreet pieces and particles  
as distinguished from fibers. The particles are combined with synthetic resins and other binders  
and bonded together under heat and pressure.  
Particleboard is used as underlayment, siding, and for shear walls. Particleboard used  
structurally for siding or shear walls must be stamped \(labeled\) M-S Exterior or M-2 Exterior.  
The “M” stands for medium density; the “2” designates the strength grade \(grades range from 1  
to 3\); and “S” designates “special grade.  
” Particleboard designated M-S is medium density and  
has physical properties between an M-1 and M-2 designation. Both must be made with exterior  
glue. See SDPWS Table 4.3A for nominal unit capacities for wood-based panel shear walls,  
including particleboard.  
Although similar in characteristics to medium-density Grade 1 particleboard, the particleboard  
intended for use as floor underlayment is designated “PBU”  
. Particleboard underlayment is often  
applied over a structural subfloor to provide a smooth surface for resilient-finish floor coverings  
or textile floor coverings. The minimum ¼-inch thickness is suitable for use over panel-type  
subflooring. Particleboard underlayment installed over board or deck subflooring that has  
multiple joints should have a thickness of ⅜ inch. Joints in the underlayment should not be  
located over the joints in the subflooring.  
For panels up to and including 3/8-inch \(9.5 mm\) thick use 3d annular threaded nails spaced 3  
inches \(76 mm\) apart around the perimeter of the panel and 6 inches \(152 mm\) on centers each  
way throughout the body of the panel. For panels 1/2- to 5/8-inches \(12.7 mm to 15.8 mm\) thick  
use 4d nails spaced 6 inches \(152 mm\) apart around the perimeter of the panel and 10 inches  
\(254 mm\) on centers each way throughout the body of the panel. Fastener lengths are designed to  
penetrate just through the subfloor and not substantially into the floor joists to minimize nail  
popping caused by shrinkage of the joists. See Table 2304.10.2.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2303.1.9 Preservative-treated wood. The applicable American Wood Protection Association  
\(AWPA\) standards are cited. Different preservative treatments are used depending on whether  
the wood is above ground or in contact with the ground.  
2303.1.9.1 Identification. All wood required to be preservative treated by Section 2304.12 must  
be stamped \(labeled\) with the information listed in the section. There are no exceptions.  
2303.1.9.2 Moisture content. The intent of this provision is to ensure that any additional  
moisture driven into the wood from the preservative-treatment process is at 19 percent or less  
prior to enclosure. This provides some margin of safety that as the treated wood dries, it will not  
support mold growth.  
2303.1.10 Structural composite lumber. The term structural composite lumber \(SCL\) refers to  
either laminated veneer lumber \(LVL\), parallel strand lumber \(PSL\), laminated strand lumber  
\(LSL\), or oriented strand lumber \(OSL\). These materials are structural members bonded with an  
exterior adhesive. SCL structural properties are set forth in manufacturers’ literature and  
evaluation reports by the ICC®  
. Definitions and provisions for manufacturing and design value  
development for SCL are based on ASTM D5456.  
LVL is the most widely used SCL product. It is produced by bonding thin wood veneers  
together. The grain of the veneers is parallel to the long direction of the member. LVL members  
have enhanced mechanical properties and dimensional stability and offer a broad range of  
product widths, depths, and lengths. LVLs are used for a variety of applications such as headers  
and beams, hip and valley rafters, rim boards, scaffold planking, studs, flange material for  
prefabricated wood I-joists, and truss chords. Some examples of commercially available  
laminated veneer lumber products are Microllam® LVL Beams manufactured by Weyerhaeuser,  
VERSA-LAM® LVL manufactured by Boise Cascade, and LP® SolidStart® LVL manufactured  
by Louisiana Pacific \(LP\).  
PSL members consist of long veneer strands in parallel formation and bonded together with  
adhesive to form the finished structural section. PSL members are commonly used for long-span  
beams, heavily loaded columns, and beam and header applications where high bending strength  
is needed. An example of a parallel strand lumber product is Parallam® PSL Beams  
manufactured by Weyerhaeuser.  
LSL and OSL are similar to PSL, but are manufactured from flaked wood strands that have a  
high length-to-thickness ratio. The primary difference between OSL and LSL is the length of  
strand used to fabricate them. OSL strands are shorter \(up to 6 inches\) than LSL strands  
\(approximately 12 inches\). The strands are combined with an exterior adhesive, and are oriented  
and formed into a large mat or billet and pressed. Although their strength and stiffness properties  
are somewhat lower than LVL and PSL members, they have good fastener-holding strength and  
mechanical connector performance. LSL and OSL members are used in a variety of applications,  
such as beams, headers, studs, rim boards, and millwork. Examples of commercially available  
LSL and OSL products include Norbord Durstrand LSL/OSL and LP® SolidStart® LSL.  
Reports prepared by approved agencies or evaluation reports published by the ICC Evaluation  
Service may be accepted as part of the evidence and data needed by the building official to form  
the basis of approval of a material or product not specifically covered in the code. Such research  
reports supplement the resources of the building official and eliminate the need for the official to  
conduct a detailed analysis on every new product. Note that evaluation reports are approved  
under the alternative materials, design, and methods of construction provisions of Section  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation104.11.  
2303.1.11 Structural log members. This section provides structural capacity and grading  
requirements for logs used as structural members. In general, all log structures require  
engineering. Establishing structural capacities of logs is based on ASTM D3957 Standard  
Practices for Establishing Stress Grades for Structural Members Used in Log Buildings which  
specifies the requirement for a grading stamp or alternative means of identification. The  
International Code Council’s® \(ICC\) Standard on the Design and Construction of Log Structures  
\(ICC 400\) also is available. The goal of the standard is to provide technical design and  
performance criteria that will facilitate and promote the design, construction, and installation of  
safe, reliable structures constructed of log timbers. It is intended to be used by design  
professionals, manufacturers, constructors, and building and other government officials, and  
continue as a referenced standard in future building codes. Because ICC 400 gives base values  
and references the NDS for design, either ASD or LRFD can be used.  
2303.1.12 Round timber poles and piles. Similar to other sections in the IBC, this section  
simply directs users to the following referenced standards regarding round timber poles and  
piles\: ASTM D3200 and ASTM D25.  
2303.1.13 Engineered wood rim board. Engineered rim board is an important structural  
element in many engineered wood applications where both structural load path through the  
perimeter member and dimensional change compatibility are important design considerations.  
This section references two standards for products intended for engineered wood rim board  
applications\: ANSI/APA PRR 410 and ASTM D7672, which address the fundamental  
requirements for testing and evaluation of engineered wood rim boards. ASTM D7672 is  
applicable to determination of product-specific rim board performance \(i.e., structural capacities\)  
for engineered wood products that may be recognized in manufacturer’s product evaluation  
reports. The PRR 410 standard also includes performance categories for engineered wood  
products used in engineered rim board applications. Under PRR 410, products are assigned a  
grade based on performance category \(e.g., categories based on structural capacity\) and bear a  
mark in accordance with the grade.  
2303.2 Fire-retardant-treated wood. Fire-retardant-treated wood \(FRTW\) is defined as any  
wood product that has been impregnated with chemicals to improve its flame-spread  
characteristics beyond that of untreated wood. The principal objective of impregnating wood  
with fire-retardant chemicals is to produce a chemical reaction at specific temperature ranges.  
This chemical reaction reduces the release of certain intermediate products that contribute to the  
flaming of wood, and also results in the increased formation of charcoal and water. Some  
chemicals are also effective in reducing the oxidation rate for the charcoal residue. Fire-retardant  
chemicals also reduce the heat release rate of the FRTW when burning over a wide range of  
temperatures. This section gives provisions for the treatment and use of FRTW. However, the  
fire-retardant chemicals are generally quite corrosive and corrosion-resistant fasteners may be  
required with FRTW. See Section 2304.10.6.  
2303.2.1 Pressure process. Treat ment using a pressure process requires a minimum pressure of  
50 psi.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2303.2.2 Other means during manufacture. This section requires treat ment using other means  
during manufacture to be an integral part of the manufacturing process.  
2303.2.3 Fire testing of wood structural panels. This section requires added testing of  
treatments not impregnated by a pressure process. Requiring equivalent performance from all  
sides of the wood product eliminates any concern over the orientation when it is installed. An  
exception to this would include wood structural panels which only require the front and back  
faces to be tested.  
2303.2.4 Labeling. Each piece of FRTW must be stamped \(labeled\). The labeling must show the  
performance of the material, including the 30-minute ASTM E84 test. The labeling must state  
the strength adjustments, and conformance to the requirements for interior or exterior  
application.  
The FRTW label must be distinct from the grading label to avoid confusion between the two.  
The grading label gives information about the properties of the wood before it is fire-retardant  
treated. The FRTW label gives properties of the wood after FRTW treatment. It is imperative  
that the FRTW label be presented in such a manner that it complements the grading label and  
does not create confusion over which label takes precedence.  
2303.2.5 Strength adjustments. Several factors can significantly affect the physical properties  
of FRTW. These factors are the pressure treatment and redrying processes used, and the  
extremes of temperature and humidity that the FRTW will be subjected to once installed. The  
design values for all FRTW must be adjusted for the effects of the treatment and environmental  
conditions, such as high temperature in attic installations and humidity. The design adjustment  
values must be based on an investigation procedure, which includes subjecting the FRTW to  
similar temperatures and humidities. The procedure must be approved by the building official.  
Two subsections prescribe specific strength adjustment requirements for treated wood  
structural panels and lumber. These sections also requires the manufacturer to publish allowable  
maximum loads and spans for service as floor and roof sheathing and the modification factors for  
roof framing for its particular treatment process.  
2303.2.5.1 Wood structural panels. This section references the test standard developed to  
evaluate the flexural properties of fire-retardant- treated plywood that is exposed to high  
temperatures. Note that while the section title refers to wood struc tural panels, the referenced  
standard is limited to soft wood plywood. Therefore, judgment is required in determining the  
effects of elevated temperature and humidity on other types of wood structural panels. The  
section references ASTM D6305 to be used to evaluate ASTM D5516 test data.  
2303.2.5.2 Lumber. This section references the test standard developed to determine the  
necessary adjustments to design val ues for lumber that has been fire-retardant treated including  
the effects of elevated temperatures. The section references ASTM D6841 to be used to evaluate  
ASTM D5664 test data.  
2303.2.6 Exposure to weather, damp, or wet locations. Some fire-retardant treatments are  
soluble when exposed to the weather or used under high-humidity conditions. When an FRTW  
product is to be exposed to weather conditions, it must be further tested in accordance with  
ASTM D2898. The material is then subjected to the ASTM weathering test and retested after  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdrying.  
2303.2.7 Interior applications. When an FRTW product is intended for use under high-  
humidity conditions, it must be further tested in accordance with ASTM D3201. The material  
must demonstrate that when tested at 92-percent relative humidity, the moisture content of the  
FRTW does not increase to more than 28 percent.  
2303.2.8 Moisture content. The intent of this provision is to ensure that any additional moisture  
driven into the wood from the treatment process is at 19 percent or less prior to enclosure. This  
provides some margin of safety that as the treated wood dries, it will not support mold growth. In  
addition, FRTW chemicals are quite corrosive to metal fasteners. Where the moisture content of  
the treated wood is too high, the corrosivity of the treated wood is even higher and contributes to  
greater corrosion of metal fasteners.  
For wood that is kiln dried after treatment \(KDAT\), the kiln temperatures cannot exceed that  
used to dry the lumber and plywood that was submitted for the tests required by Section  
2303.2.5.1 for plywood and Section 2303.2.5.2 for lumber.  
2303.2.9 Types I and II construction applications. Use of FRTW in Type I or II construction  
is limited to nonload-bearing partitions and exterior walls and roof construction of buildings not  
over two stories high.  
2303.3 Hardwood and plywood. Hardwood plywood and decorative plywood are not used for  
structural purposes. This section references the American National Standard for Hardwood and  
Decorative Plywood.  
2303.4 Trusses. All types of trusses are included within these provisions, including those with  
parallel, pitched, or curved chords; bowstring, sawtooth or camelback profiles; heavy-bolted  
timber or light-gage metal-plate-connected elements. Other trusses that are somewhat common  
in the industry include those with wood chords and metal tubular webs connected with bolts or  
pins. Some agricultural structures or other U occupancy buildings use plywood gusset plates to  
connect sawn lumber chords and webs.  
This section includes general design requirements; specific and detailed requirements for truss  
design drawings; requirements for truss member permanent bracing; provisions for truss  
placement diagrams; specific requirements for the requirements for the truss submittal package;  
and specific truss anchorage requirements. The truss submittal package is part of the construction  
documents, which are part of the submittal documents.  
2303.4.1 Design. Wood trusses must be designed in accordance with accepted engineering  
practice, which is generally governed by state laws that regulate professional engineering. Truss  
members are permitted to be joined by any acceptable method.  
The truss designer should furnish complete calculations substantiating the size of all members  
and connector plate sizes. The truss calculations should indicate the combined stress index for  
members subjected to combined stresses from bending and axial compression and tension. The  
combined stress index should be less than one. The calculations are generally performed with a  
computer program; therefore, documentation may be required by the building official that  
substantiates the basis of the computer program used.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2303.4.1.1 Truss design drawings. The section prescribes what information is to be provided on  
truss drawings. Truss design drawings are to be approved by the building official prior to  
installation, and the design drawings are to be on the job site. Note that where required by the  
building official or state law, truss deign drawings do need to be stamped and signed by the truss  
engineer.  
2303.4.1.2 Permanent individual truss member restraint \(PITMR\) and permanent  
individual truss member diagonal bracing \(PITMDB\). Where permanent diagonal bracing or  
restraint is required it should be indicated on the truss design drawings and meet the methods  
prescribed in the section \(see Figure 2303-3\).  
Figure 2303-3 Permanent truss member restraint and bracing.  
Permanent lateral bracing requirements \(e.g., restraint and diagonal bracing\) should be  
specified by the truss designer. Temporary bracing should be left in place until permanent  
bracing is installed. All lateral bracing must be installed per the truss design so that the truss will  
have the same structural capacity for which it was designed. In any case, the individual truss  
member continuous lateral and diagonal bracing locations are to be shown on the truss design  
drawings.  
Permanent bracing must be installed in compliance with the truss industry’s permanent  
bracing standard details that follow sound engineering practice. These details are found in the  
Building Component Safety Information \(BCSI\) Guide to Good Practice for the Handling,  
Installing & Bracing of Metal-Plate-Connected Wood Trusses, a document produced by the  
Structural Building Components Association \(SBCA\). It is the truss industry’s guide for job-site  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsafety and truss performance. The BCSI publication is available from the SBCA website at  
www.sbcindustry.com.  
2303.4.1.2.1 Trusses installed without a diaphragm. Trusses installed without a diaphragm on  
the top or bottom chord require a project-specific PITMR and PITMDB design prepared by a  
RDP. Group U buildings are exempt from this requirement.  
2303.4.1.3 Trusses spanning 60 feet or greater. Trusses spanning 60 feet or more require an  
RDP to design the temporary and permanent bracing. Note that a similar requirement in Section  
2211.1.3.2 applies to cold-formed steel trusses spanning 60 feet or more.  
2303.4.1.4 Truss designer. In general, the truss designer is a specialty engineer that works for  
the truss manufacturer and is not the same as the RDP responsible for the overall building  
design. Section 2303.4.1.4.1 specifies what documents need to be stamped and signed by the  
truss engineer.  
2303.4.2 Truss placement diagram. The truss placement diagram is used in the field to  
facilitate proper installation of the trusses. Note, truss placement diagrams that deviate from the  
design drawings’ layout are required to be stamped and signed by the truss engineer.  
2303.4.3 Truss submittal package. The section describes what documents are required to be  
included in the truss submittal package.  
2303.4.4 Anchorage. The requirement in this section is an essential ingredient in providing a  
complete and continuous load path as required by Section 1604.4. The design of the anchorage  
required to transfer loads \(gravity and lateral\) from each truss to the supporting structure is the  
responsibility of the RDP. This is most critical for lateral loads where forces must be transferred  
from the roof diaphragm to the collectors and supporting shear walls, but it is also important for  
gravity loads. To illustrate a simple case, if the trusses are spaced at 24 inches \(610 mm\) on  
center and the supporting studs are spaced at 16 inches \(406 mm\) on center, some trusses will  
occur between studs. Depending on the roof load, such as where high snow loads occur, the  
double top plate may not be adequate to span between studs and support the truss reaction. In this  
case, the simple solution is for the RDP to require a stud under each truss. Another example is  
multi-ply girder trusses with very high reactions. In this case, the simple solution is for the RDP  
to require a stud under each ply in the girder truss.  
2303.4.5 Alterations to trusses. Obviously truss members should not be cut, notched, drilled,  
spliced, or altered in any way without approval of the truss engineer. Any addition of loads from  
HVAC equipment, piping, additional roofing, and so on should be reviewed and approved by the  
engineer to ensure that the trusses are capable of supporting additional loading.  
2303.4.6 TPI 1 specifications. The design, manufacture, and quality assurance of metal-plate-  
connected wood trusses are to be in accordance with the TPI 1 standard, National Design  
Standard for Metal-Plate-Connected Wood Truss Construction. The IBC references TPI 1,  
which is available from the Truss Plate Institute at www.tpinst.org.  
2303.4.7 Truss quality assurance. The TPI 1 standard includes quality-assurance procedures for  
truss manufacturers. Trusses not manufactured in accordance with the TPI 1 standard or another  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationapproved standard that provides quality control under the supervision of a third-party quality  
control agency require special inspection unless the manufacturer is an approved fabricator in  
accordance with Section 1704.2.5.  
2303.5 Test standard for joist hangers. The section references ASTM D7147, which includes  
sampling and evaluation criteria as well as further refinements regarding quality of test materials,  
adjustments for variation in test materials, and limits on design values with materials other than  
those tested.  
2303.6 Nails and staples. This section references ASTM F1667, including Supplement 1, for  
driven fasteners such as nails, spikes, and staples. Bending yield strength requirements for nails  
are provided. The bending yield strength requirements are those used in the NDS lateral strength  
tables, the IBC and IRC fastener schedules, as well as model code evaluation reports. These  
strengths are standardized within the nail industry for engineered fasteners and are set forth in  
ASTM F1667 Specification for Driven Fasteners\: Nails, Spikes and Staples.  
2303.7 Shrinkage. Because wood shrinkage is a concern, two sections address shrinkage,  
Sections 2303.7 and 2304.3.3. Section 2303.7 requires the designer to consider the effects of  
cross-grain dimensional changes \(shrinkage\) in the vertical direction that can occur in lumber  
that was fabricated green. According to DOC PS 20, dry lumber is lumber that has been seasoned  
or dried to a maximum moisture content of 19 percent. Green lumber is lumber that has a  
moisture content in excess of 19 percent. The NDS Supplement provides nominal and minimum  
dressed sizes for dimension lumber \[less than 5-inch \(127 mm\) nominal dimensions\] and timbers  
\[5-inch \(127 mm\) nominal and greater dimensions\]. A practical “rule of thumb” for  
consideration of cross-grain dimensional change is to anticipate a 1 percent change in dimension  
for every 4 percent change in moisture content. More precise equations are available for  
designers seeking more detailed calculations. Shrinkage in the longitudinal direction \(along the  
length\) of lumber is approximately one-tenth of the cross-grain directions, so shrinkage along the  
length of a stud, for example, can typically be ignored.  
Section 2304 General Construction Requirements  
2304.1 General. The requirements of Section 2304 are general and apply to all of the design  
methods specified in Section 2302.1, which include\: Allowable Stress Design, Load and  
Resistance Factor Design, Conventional Light-Frame Construction, AWC WFCM and, for log  
structures, ICC 400.  
2304.2 Size of structural members. Computations to determine the size of the member required  
by the design are to be based on the actual sizes or dimensions and not the “nominal” sizes. For  
example, when computing the cross-sectional area of a 2x4, the actual dimensions of 1.5 inches  
\(38 mm\) by 3.5 inches \(89 mm\) are to be used. The NDS Supplement Table 1A provides  
nominal and minimum dressed \(actual\) sizes for dimension lumber and timbers; Tables 1B, 1C,  
and 1D provide section properties based on actual dimensions for dressed sawn lumber and  
structural glued-laminated timber.  
2304.3 Wall framing. This section addresses minimum prescriptive requirements for wood-  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationframed walls. These provisions include the framing of bottom plates, the framing over openings  
within the wall, and shrinkage. The shrinkage requirement sets a limit on the height of wood  
framed walls at no more than two floors and a roof. For all of these provisions, an exception is  
made when a “specific design is furnished.  
”  
2304.3.1 Bottom plates. These prescriptive provisions require sill plates to be at least as wide as  
the vertical framing members they are supporting and a minimum of 2-inch \(51 mm\) nominal or  
1.5-inch \(38 mm\) actual thickness.  
2304.3.2 Framing over openings. Windows, doors, air-conditioning units, and other service  
equipment require openings to be provided in wood-stud walls and partitions. Loads imposed  
above these openings must be transferred by a structural element above the opening to supports  
on both sides of the opening and then to a foundation, load-bearing wall or partition. Header  
sizes and spans may be determined per Section 2308.5.5.1. All headers not selected from span  
tables must be engineered in accordance with Section 2302.1. In all cases, headers and their  
supports must be adequate to support the imposed loads \(see Figure 2304-1\). See discussion in  
2308.5.5 regarding prescriptive solutions for openings in walls and partitions.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2304-1 Typical headers over wall openings.  
2304.3.3 Shrinkage. This section imposes requirements for considering wood shrinkage. Wood-  
framed walls and bearing partitions cannot support more than two floors and a roof unless an  
analysis shows that there will be no adverse effects on the structure or its systems resulting from  
anticipated shrinkage or differential movement caused by shrinkage. Systems that typically  
experience adverse effects include plumbing and mechanical systems. There have been cases  
reported in multistory wood-frame projects where shrinkage was not considered in the building  
design, and shrinkage of the framing caused plumbing breaks in the stud walls. With the  
proliferation of mid-rise \(four stories and higher\) wood-frame construction, in many areas of the  
country, designers and code officials need to be aware of proper design and detailing associated  
with multistory wood-frame buildings.  
2304.4 Floor and roof framing. Similar to wall framing, this section addresses minimum  
prescriptive requirements which apply to wood-framed floors and roofs. These requirements are  
found in Section 2308. As with wall framing, all of the provisions in this section include an  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationexception when a “specific design is furnished.  
”  
2304.5 Framing around flues and chimneys. This section sets the minimum distance  
combustible framing materials must be from flues, chimneys, fireplaces, and flue openings.  
Specific wording in the code requires wood framing to be a minimum of 2 inches \(51 mm\) clear  
from flues, chimneys, and fireplaces, and 6 inches \(152 mm\) clear from flue openings.  
Additional distance requirements are found within Sections 2111, 2113 of the IBC and within the  
International Mechanical Code® \(IMC®\). The separations specified in this section and in the  
IMC are intended to prevent the possibility of the wood being subjected to low heat for extended  
periods of time. Note that 2 inches \(51 mm\) of masonry will not provide the same level of  
thermal resistance as 2 inches \(51 mm\) of air space. Therefore, adding 2 inches \(51 mm\) to the  
required thickness of a fireplace or chimney wall will not serve as an acceptable alternative to the  
2-inch \(51-mm\) clear air space requirement.  
2304.6 Exterior wall sheathing. This section specifies that wall sheathing on the exterior face of  
all exterior walls along with the connection of the sheathing to the supporting framing is to be of  
sufficient strength to span between the studs or other structural members, and capable of  
resisting wind pressures. The minimum strength or thickness of most of the exterior wall-  
covering materials listed in Table 2304.6.1 is based on a stud spacing of 16 \(406 mm\) or 24  
inches \(610 mm\) on center.  
2304.6.1 Wood structural panel sheathing. Wood structural panel sheathing used as an exterior  
wall finish must have an Exterior type durability designation. Wood structural panels used under  
an exterior finish such as roof or wall covering must have an Exterior or Exposure 1 designation.  
Exposure 1 panels are allowed to be exposed on the underside of eaves.  
Table 2304.6.1 provides usage requirements and limitations for wood structural panels used  
as exterior sheathing to resist wind pressures. For a given wind speed and exposure category, the  
table gives the minimum nail size, wood structural panel span rating, panel thickness, stud  
spacing, and nailing schedule. The limitations of the table are\: the building must be enclosed  
\(ASCE 7 Section 26.2\); the mean roof height must be not greater than 30 feet \(9,144 mm\)  
\(ASCE 7 Section 26.12\), and topographic factor must be equal to 1.0 \(ASCE 7 Section 26.8\).  
Table 2304.6.1 was originally developed by comparing the component and cladding wind  
pressures given in ASCE 7-05 Figure 6-3 with the wood structural panel capacities based on U.S.  
DOC PS 2 standard, engineering calculations, and the APA Panel Design Specification  
referenced in Section 2306.1. Nail head pull through and withdrawal capacity was also  
considered in addition to panel stiffness and bending strength. Panel-fastener capacity was based  
on tributary area to a single critical nail. Buildings that do not meet the limitations placed on this  
table are required to use ASCE 7 to engineer the exterior sheathing to resist component and  
cladding wind pressures.  
2304.7 Interior paneling. Softwood wood structural panels used for interior paneling are to be  
installed in accordance with Table 2304.10.2 and comply with DOC PS 1 or PS 2. Softwood  
panels installed in accordance with this section are considered interior wall finishes and cannot  
be used to resist lateral forces. Prefinished hardboard paneling must conform to the requirements  
of AHA A135.5, and hardwood plywood must conform to HPVA HP-1.  
2304.8 Floor and roof sheathing. This section specifies the wood structural panel sheathing  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrequirements for floors in Section 2304.8.1 and for roofs in Section 2304.8.2.  
2304.8.1 Structural floor sheathing. Structural floor sheathing serves three purposes\:  
1\. 2. 3. Provides support for and distributes superimposed loads to floor trusses or joists.  
Provides lateral support for the top of the floor trusses or joists.  
Serves as part of the shear-resisting element when the floor acts as a diaphragm to  
distribute lateral wind or seismic loads to the shear walls or foundation.  
The sheathing may either be engineered to meet the loading requirements, or be selected from  
the tables in the code. The tables are prescriptive and therefore deemed to comply with the  
minimum code requirements.  
The maximum span for wood structural panels is limited by both strength and deflection.  
Table 2304.8\(3\) limits deflection to L/180 under the tabulated uniform dead and live load, or  
L/240 under the tabulated uniform live load only. Deflections for combination  
subfloor/underlayment grades in Table 2304.8\(4\) are based on a deflection of L/360 caused by a  
total uniform load of 100 psf \(4.79 kN/m2\) except for 1⅛-inch \(29 mm\) panels on joists spaced at  
48 inches \(1,219 mm\) on center, which are rated at a deflection of L/360 at a uniform load of 65  
psf \(3.11 kN/m2\). When using the tables, all the conditions set forth in the table must be met  
regarding loads, type, grade, species group, plies, blocking, direction of span, and other  
requirements. Sheathing systems that do not meet all the conditions must be engineered.  
Wood structural panels in Table 2304.8\(3\) are designated by the panel span rating instead of  
thickness. The rating consists of two numbers such as 32/16. The first number is the allowable  
span for use as roof sheathing, and the second is the allowable span for use as floor sheathing.  
Panels intended only for single floor grades are designated by one span rating. The single floor  
grades have higher-grade faces than Structural I panels and may be preferable for aesthetic  
reasons as roof sheathing where visible from the underside.  
Several thicknesses of structural panel are included under a single panel span rating. This is  
because different grades of interior and face veneers or strands may be used in different  
combinations. For example, a five-ply plywood panel will have a higher load rating than a four-  
ply panel with the same thickness. Conversely, the five-ply panel may be thinner than the four-  
ply panel, yet have the same panel span rating. For example, a 15/32-inch-thick \(11.9 mm\) four-  
ply panel will support the same total load as a 7/16-inch-thick \(11.1 mm\) five-ply panel. The ⅜-  
inch \(9.5 mm\) wood structural panel is currently the minimum thickness in the table.  
2304.8.2 Structural roof sheathing. Roof sheathing must be designed or conform to the  
provisions of Table 2304.8\(1\), 2304.8\(2\), 2304.8\(3\), or 2304.8\(5\). Wood structural panel roof  
sheathing must be bonded by exterior glue.  
2304.9 Lumber decking. These provisions cover all decking, including mechanically laminated  
and solid-sawn decking. The general provisions, Section 2304.9.1, specify the requirements for  
square ends, beveled ends, and the orientation of tongue-and-groove decking on roofs.  
Section 2304.9.2 provides specific requirements for the various layup patterns described in  
the subsections. Sections 2304.9.3 through 2304.9.5 cover specific requirements for  
mechanically laminated decking, 2-inch \(51 mm\) sawn tongue-and-groove decking, and 3- and  
4-inch \(76 mm and 102 mm\) sawn tongue-and-groove decking, respectively.  
It should be noted that the capacity of lumber decking is determined using the various layup  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationpatterns described in Section 2304.9.2. Depending upon the layup pattern, Section 2306.1.4 gives  
the design capacity of lumber decking for flexure and deflection formulas within Table 2306.1.4.  
2304.10 Connections and fasteners. Connectors and fasteners must comply with the applicable  
provisions of Sections 2304.10.1 through 2304.10.8. The section covers fasteners used to  
connect wood members, sheathing fasteners, fasteners for joist hangers, and framing hardware,  
and specific requirements for fasteners used in treated wood. Other fastening methods such as  
clips, staples, and glue are allowed where approved.  
2304.10.1 Connection fire-resistance rating. Fire-resistance ratings for connections in Type  
IV-A, IV-B, or IV-C construction are to be determined either by testing in accordance with  
Section 703.2 where the connection is part of a fire-resistance test or by engineering analysis.  
The provisions are not applicable to connections in heavy timber \(IV-HT\) construction, because  
heavy timber structural members do not have a prescribed fire-resistance rating.  
Sections 704.2 and 704.3 require connections of columns and other primary structural  
members to be protected with materials that have the required fire-resistance rating. However,  
Sections 704.2 and 704.3 do not require connections that join elements of the structural frame to  
be tested in accordance with ASTM E119. The requirement is for the connections to only be  
protected with material having the fire-resistance rating required for the structural members  
which they connect. It is neither practical nor possible to test connections in a standard fire test  
furnace since there is no capability to test large connections used to transfer gravity loads. In  
addition, ASTM E119 does not include any provisions for how to test connections and assess  
their performance. While testing of large gravity load connections is not contemplated by ASTM  
E119, the fasteners that are used to connect elements of an assembly are considered part of the  
test and critical to the assembly’s fire performance. For example, the fastening system used to  
connect multiple pieces of abutting nail-laminated timber which forms a floor assembly is  
considered part of the tested assembly. Proper detailing of the system used to connect abutting  
segments is a primary factor in meeting the thermal pass/fail criteria established in ASTM E119.  
The connection system has little bearing on the structural performance but is necessary to  
prevent the passage of hot gases at abutting edges.  
An engineering analysis per Option 2 of Section 2304.10.1 would need to demonstrate that  
the temperature rise at any portion of the connection is limited to an average temperature rise of  
250°F \(139°C\), and a maximum temperature rise of 325°F \(181°C\), for a time corresponding to  
the required fire-resistance rating of the structural element being connected. For the purposes of  
this analysis, the connection includes connectors, fasteners, and portions of wood members  
included in the structural design of the connection. Potential options for engineering analysis  
include the following\:  
• IBC Section 722 permits structural fire-resistance ratings of wood members to be  
determined using Chapter 16 of the AWC National Design Specification for Wood  
Construction \(NDS\). Where a wood connection is required to be fire-resistance-rated,  
NDS Section 16.3 requires all components of the wood connection, including the steel  
connector, the connection fasteners, and the wood needed in the connection’s structural  
design, to be protected for the minimum required fire-resistance time. The connection is  
permitted to be protected by wood, gypsum board, or other approved materials.  
• Analysis procedures have been developed that allow protection of these connections to be  
designed based on test results of ASTM E119 fire tests from protection configurations  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationusing the wood member outside of the connection, additional wood cover, and/or gypsum  
board. AWC Technical Report 10\: Calculating the Fire Resistance of Wood Members  
and Assemblies \(TR10\), which is referenced in the NDS Chapter 16 Commentary,  
provides examples of connection designs meeting the requirements of IBC Section 704  
and NDS Section 16.3 \(Figure 2304-2\).  
Figure 2304-2 Mass timber fastener protection example \(from AWC TR10, courtesy  
American Wood Council\).  
It should be noted that Section 110.3.5 establishes inspection requirements where wood cover  
is specified to provide fire-resistance protection of connections in Types IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C  
construction.  
2304.10.2 Fasteners requirements. While this section states that connectors are to be designed  
in accordance with Section 2302.1, the minimum number and size of fasteners are found in Table  
2304.10.2\. The size designations in the table are common to all fastener manufacturers. This  
table accommodates the builder of non-designed \(conventional\) construction, but also provides  
minimum fastening requirements for designed construction. Details such as end and edge  
distances and nail penetration are required to be in accordance with the applicable provisions of  
the NDS. Where required, corrosion-resistant fasteners must be either hot-dipped zinc-coated  
galvanized steel, stainless steel, silicon bronze, or copper.  
Because the pennyweight system of specifying nail sizes is not universally understood, code  
users sometimes focus on pennyweight \(8d = 8 penny, 16d = 16 penny, etc.\) and do not pay  
sufficient attention to the specific type of nail such as common, box, cooler, sinker, finish, and so  
on. A typical example is substitution of box nails for common nails of the same pennyweight.  
The specific type of nail is critical because there can be significant differences in strength  
properties of connections fastened with nails of the same pennyweight but of different nail type.  
Because nominal dimensions are less subject to misinterpretation, the shank length and diameter  
in parentheses will help prevent confusion and misapplication of the various types of nails used  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationin wood connections.  
Roof sheathing nailing criteria in Table 2304.10.2 is based on ASCE 7 and AWC’s WFCM.  
Wind uplift nailing requirements for common species of roof framing are the basis of nail  
spacing requirements in Table 2304.10.2 to meet wind uplift loading requirements of ASCE 7  
without being overly complex in specification of wood structural panel roof sheathing nailing.  
The basic roof sheathing nailing schedule is 6 inches \(152 mm\) on-center at panel edges and 6  
inches \(152 mm\) on-center at intermediate supports in the panel field. For the common case of  
roof framing spaced at 24 inches \(610 mm\) on-center, nailing at intermediate supports in the  
roof’s interior portions is 6 inches \(152 mm\) on-center for wind speeds within the scope of IBC  
Section 2308. Six inches \(152 mm\) on-center spacing is also appropriate for edge zones except  
where ultimate wind speeds equal or exceed 130 mph \(58 m/s\) in Exposure B and 110 mph \(49  
m/s\) in Exposure C where 4 inches \(102 mm\) on-center nail spacing is required. These special  
cases are addressed by footnote “f.  
” Footnote “g” also provides an alternative fastening schedule  
to ASCE 7 uplift loading requirements for specification of wood structural panel roof sheathing  
attachment using staples or certain nails in ½-inch \(12.7 mm\) or less wood structural panels.  
Table 2304.10.2 and IRC Table R602.3\(1\) are consistent when addressing the structural  
connection of Items 1 through 39.  
2304.10.3 Sheathing fasteners. Fasteners should be driven flush with the surface of the  
sheathing, but not overdriven. Overdriving of fasteners can significantly reduce the withdrawal  
capacity of the fastener as well as the shear capacity and ductility of the diaphragm or shear wall.  
For three-ply material, the strength reduction is significant if the fastener is overdriven through  
one ply.  
If no more than 20 percent of the fasteners around the perimeter of the panel are overdriven  
by ⅛ inch \(3.2 mm\) or less, then no reduction in shear capacity need be considered. If more than  
20 percent of the fasteners around the perimeter are overdriven by any amount, or if any  
fasteners are overdriven by more than ⅛ inch \(3.2 mm\), then additional fasteners must be driven  
to maintain the desired shear capacity, provided that the additional fasteners will not split the  
substrate. For every two fasteners overdriven, one additional fastener should be driven.  
2304.10.4 Joist hangers and framing anchors. Most joist hangers and other framing hardware  
have reports issued by building product evaluation services. Such ICC Evaluation Services and  
detailed reports are issued for the various products. There are acceptance criteria for the  
performance of the hardware in terms of the strength limit states of the metal, wood, and  
fasteners, as well as deflection limit states. For example, ICC AC 13, Acceptance Criteria for  
Joist Hangers and Similar Devices, is used to evaluate devices used to support or attach wood  
members, such as joists, rafters, purlins, beams, girders, plates, posts, studs, and headers to  
wood, metal, concrete, or masonry where the attachment is by means of mechanical fastenings  
such as nails, spikes, lag screws, wood screws, bolts, and so on. The term “device” refers to one  
or more pieces or units so arranged as to transfer load vertically or laterally, within safe limits,  
from the end of a supported member \(such as a joist\) to a supporting member \(such as a header,  
beam, or girder\).  
Test requirements for joist hangers are found in ASTM D7147. The ASTM D7147 standard  
includes sampling and evaluation criteria as well as further refinements regarding quality of test  
materials, adjustments for variation in test materials, and limits on design values with materials  
other than those tested.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2304.10.5 Other fasteners. Fasteners not specifically cited in the code may be used but are  
subject to building official approval. See Section 1703.4 for requirements related to research  
reports and acceptance of evaluation reports.  
2304.10.6 Fasteners and connectors in contact with preservative-treated and fire-retardant-  
treated wood. Some chemicals used in preservative-treated and fire-retardant-treated wood are  
corrosive. Fasteners, washers, and nuts must be corrosion resistant when used with these  
materials. Corrosion-resistant fasteners, washers, and nuts are made of type 304 or 316 stainless  
steel, silicon bronze, copper, or steel that has been hot-dipped or mechanically deposited zinc-  
coated galvanized with a zinc coating of not less than 1.0 ounce per square foot.  
Class 55, a mechanical galvanizing process, provides an equivalent amount of zinc as would  
be provided by the hot-dip process in accordance with ASTM A153. According to the American  
Galvanizers Association, mechanically plating to a thickness of 55 microns provides an  
equivalent coating to 1 ounce per square foot \(305 g/m2\) of hot-dipped galvanized zinc, which is  
what is provided for fasteners by ASTM A153.  
Electro-galvanized steel fasteners do not qualify as corrosion resistant; the zinc coating  
typically is about 0.1 ounce per square foot \(30.5 g/m2\). Electro-galvanized nails are suitable  
only for occasionally wet locations such as for nailing composition shingles.  
The section is subdivided into four categories of fasteners and connectors in treated wood\:  
fasteners in preservative-treated wood, fastening for wood foundations, fasteners in fire-  
retardant-treated wood in exterior, wet or damp locations, and fasteners in fire-retardant-treated  
wood in interior locations.  
Additionally, there is an exception for fasteners used in preservative-treated wood in an  
interior dry environment. There is no documented evidence of any detrimental fastener corrosion  
when plain steel fasteners are used in SBX/DOT \(sodium borate\) or zinc borate preservative-  
treated wood in interior, dry environments. In this case, the exception permits plain carbon steel  
fasteners to be used.  
2304.10.7 Load path. The code requires the load path to be continuous from the load’s point of  
origin to the resisting element, which generally means from the roof to the foundation. A  
continuous load path for both gravity and lateral loads is necessary for adequate performance of  
the structure. This is especially critical in the case of high wind and load effects from earthquake  
ground motion. For example, visualize what happens to the wind suction load on a low-slope  
roof. The upward force that is not offset by the dead load of the roof elements must be resisted  
by dead load elsewhere. Similarly, where the structure is subjected to lateral load effects from  
earthquake ground motion, the inertial forces from the floor and roof diaphragms must be  
effectively transferred to the vertical lateral-force-resisting elements. A positive, properly  
detailed and constructed continuous load path is essential to ensure the transfer of all gravity,  
uplift, and lateral loads from the roof and floors through the structural system down to the  
foundation and supporting soil.  
The required minimum thickness of steel straps used to splice discontinuous framing  
members is consistent with the standard thickness in the AISI Product Data Standard, S201. AISI  
S201 provides criteria, material, and product requirements for structural and nonstructural  
members utilized in cold-formed steel framing applications where the specified minimum base  
steel thickness is between 18 mils \(0.0179 inch or 0.455 mm\) and 11 mils \(0.1180 inch or 3 mm\).  
The minimum thickness specified in the code represented galvanized 20 gage steel, but the term  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation“gage” is no longer a steel thickness designation and is now designated as 0.0329 inch \(0.84  
mm\), which is the minimum base metal thickness of 0.0329 inch \(0.84 mm\) for steel straps used  
to splice discontinuous framing members.  
2304.10.8 Framing requirements. Columns must be provided with full end bearing to transfer  
their full compressive load. If not providing full bearing contact, the column’s load carrying  
capacity will be reduced. Connections must also be able to resist lateral and net uplift loads.  
2304.11 Heavy timber construction. Section 2304.11 can best be described as the section for  
“all things heavy timber.  
” Table 2304.11 includes a description of heavy timber structural  
elements based on whether the element supports roof loads and floor loads or only roof loads.  
Specific footnotes about the size and protection of spaced truss elements and the reduction of  
roof beam width for sprinklers are noted where applicable. The nonsize-related detailing  
provisions for framing members and connections are included in Section 2304.11.1. Sections  
2304.11.2 through 2304.11.4 contain pertinent thickness and detailing requirements for walls,  
roof, and floor deck construction. Appropriate distinctions between nominal, net finished, and  
actual dimensions for heavy timber, glulam, SCL, and CLT are provided.  
Table 2304-11. Minimum Dimensions of Heavy Timber Structural Members  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2304.11.1 Details of heavy timber structural members. This section represents the  
consolidation of non-size related detailing provisions for heavy timber framing members and  
connections. This Section is subdivided to address columns in 2304.11.1.1, floor framing in  
2304.11.1.2, and roof framing in 2304.11.1.3.  
2304.11.1.1 Columns. Columns in heavy timber construction must be continuous throughout all  
stories, capable of supporting beams and columns above, and able to transfer vertical and  
horizontal loads through the joints and connections. Girders and beams at column connections in  
heavy timber construction are required to be fitted around columns, and adjoining ends must be  
adequately tied to each other to transfer horizontal loads across the joints.  
2304.11.1.2 Floor framing. Wall pockets or hangers are required where wood beams, girders, or  
trusses in heavy timber construction are supported by masonry or concrete walls. Beams  
supporting floors are required to bear on girders or be supported by ledgers, blocks, or hangers.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2304.11.1.3 Roof framing. Roof girders and every alternate roof beam in heavy timber  
construction are to be anchored to supporting members with steel or iron bolts designed to resist  
vertical and lateral loads of the roof.  
2304.11.2 Partitions and walls. This section addresses exterior walls, interior walls, and  
partitions. The first subsection states that cross-laminated timber, meeting the requirements of  
Section 2303.1.1, can be used for exterior walls. The second subsection allows a minimum of  
two layers of 1-inch \(25.4 mm\) nominal matched boards or laminated construction at least four-  
inches \(102 mm\) thick. The latter provides for the use of CLT. Partitions can also be one-hour  
fire-resistance-rated construction such as a stud and gypsum board FRR assembly.  
2304.11.3 Floors. This section has two subsections addressing cross-laminated timber floors and  
sawn or glued-laminated plank floors\: Sections 2304.11.3.1 and 2304.11.3.2, respectively. Items  
to note include floor decks and floor covering in heavy timber construction cannot extend closer  
than ½ inch to walls with the space covered by a molding fastened to the wall.  
Also notable is an allowance for concealed spaces in traditional Type IV-HT construction  
complying with Section 602.4.4.3. Historically, concealed spaces have not been permitted in  
traditional heavy timber construction. Protection options include\:  
• In fully sprinklered buildings, installing automatic sprinkler protection in the concealed  
space.  
• Filling the space with noncombustible insulation.  
• Protecting combustible surfaces with not less than 5/8-inch \(15.9 mm\) Type X gypsum  
board.  
Concealed spaces in new Types IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C construction are also addressed  
separately. The option of having protected concealed spaces in Type IV-HT buildings is  
important for encouraging adaptive re-use of existing heavy timber buildings as well as  
providing for installation of mechanicals \(MEP\) in Type IV-HT cross-laminated timber  
construction.  
2304.11.4 Roof decks. Subsections 2304.11.4.1 Cross-laminated timber roofs and 2304.11.4.2  
Sawn, wood structural panel, or glued-laminated plank roofs address roof deck construction. See  
preceding discussion in Section 2304.11.3 “Floors” for allowance for concealed spaces in  
traditional Type IV-HT construction complying with Section 602.4.4.3.  
2304.12 Protection against decay and termites. The provisions of this section are intended to  
protect wood against decay caused by water or termite infestation. The provisions are based on  
the extensive material on biodeterioration of wood in the Wood Handbook published by the U.S.  
Forest Products Laboratory.  
2304.12.1 Locations requiring water borne preservatives or naturally durable wood. Wood  
used in direct contact with the ground, in areas close to the ground, or exposed directly to  
weather \(Sections 2304.12.1.1 through 2304.12.1.5, 2304.12.2.6, and 2304.12.2.8\), must be  
naturally durable or preservative-treated with water borne preservatives. Wood used above  
ground, if preservative treated, is usually treated with a water borne preservative such as  
Alkaline Copper Quaternary \(ACQ\) or Copper Azole \(CA\) in accordance with AWPA U1. The  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationretention rates are lower than those required for ground contact.  
2304.12.1.1 Joists, girders, and subfloor. The code requires a minimum of 18 inches \(457 mm\)  
of clearance to joists and 12 inches \(305 mm\) clearance to wood girders from exposed ground if  
they are not of naturally durable or preservative-treated wood. See Figure 2304-3.  
Figure 2304-3 Under-floor clearances.  
2304.12.1.2 Wood supported by exterior foundation walls. Framing, including sheathing \(not  
siding\), must have a minimum of 8 inches \(203 mm\) of clearance from exposed earth if it is not  
naturally durable or preservative-treated wood. See Figure 2304-4. Note that Section 2304.12.1.5  
allows a 6-inch \(152 mm\) clearance for wood siding.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2304-4 Clearance between wood framing, wood siding, and earth.  
2304.12.1.3 Exterior walls below grade. Untreated wood framing attached to the interior side  
of exterior concrete or masonry foundation walls may draw moisture leading to decay.  
2304.12.1.4 Sleepers and sills. Concrete and masonry slabs that are in direct contact with the  
earth are very susceptible to moisture because of absorption of ground water. Similar to exterior  
walls below grade, this can occur on interior slabs as well as at the perimeter. This section is  
intended to prevent the use of untreated wood that may decay under such conditions. Concrete  
that is fully separated from the ground by a vapor barrier is not considered to be in direct contact  
with earth.  
2304.12.1.5 Wood siding. Wood siding must have a minimum of 6 inches \(152 mm\) of  
clearance between the siding and earth unless made of naturally durable or preservative-treated  
wood. Note that the clearance for wood sheathing under the siding is 8 inches \(203 mm\) as  
required by Section 2304.12.1.2. In other words, siding can extend 2 inches \(51 mm\) below the  
foundation plate, or framing, whereas the sheathing must be terminated at the sill plate. See  
Figure 2304-4.  
The IBC requires a minimum 2-inch \(51 mm\) clearance between wood siding and a concrete  
slab or steps.  
2304.12.2 Other locations. When preservative-treated wood is used in interior locations, two  
coats of a protective finish are required to be applied after the wood is dried unless water borne  
preservatives are used. The code further specifies that the protective finish is to be urethane,  
shellac, latex, epoxy, or varnish.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2304.12.2.1 Girder ends. A ½-inch \(12.7 mm\) airspace is required around the top, sides, and  
ends of wood girders embedded in concrete or masonry exterior walls to reduce moisture takeup  
that can contribute to decay of an untreated wood member.  
2304.12.2.2 Posts or columns. Posts and columns are required to be naturally durable or  
preservative-treated wood unless they meet the minimum clearances illustrated in Figure 2304-5.  
Figure 2304-5 Wood posts and columns.  
2304.12.2.3 Supporting member for permanent appurtenances. Balconies, porches, and other  
appurtenances that are directly exposed to weather conditions can collect water in the joints and  
on the surfaces, creating alternating cycles of wetting and drying conducive to deterioration and  
decay. In this case, the wood-framed structural supports must be of naturally durable or  
preservative-treated wood. The exception can be applied to buildings located in areas where  
climatic conditions are favorable enough to preclude the use of naturally durable or preservative-  
treated wood. For example, very dry desert areas such as Death Valley, California, and Yuma  
Valley, Arizona, have extremely low annual precipitation where the exception could be used  
with the approval of the building official.  
2304.12.2.4 Supporting members for permeable floors and roofs. Where wood framing is  
used to support floors and roofs that are moisture permeable, such as a concrete slab over a patio  
or a patio slab over a garage, the framing must be of preservative-treated wood or approved  
naturally durable species, unless the slab is separated from the wood framing by a waterproof  
membrane that is capable of providing positive drainage. Although these wood-framing members  
are not necessarily in direct contact with the ground, their exposure to moisture is similar to that  
of wood in direct contact with the ground. Therefore, the wood framing must be of naturally  
durable wood, or it must be preservative treated in accordance with applicable AWPA standards.  
2304.12.2.5 Ventilation beneath balconies or elevated walking surfaces. These provisions  
address required ventilation openings to provide cross-ventilation to enclosed framing supporting  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationexterior balconies and elevated walking surfaces exposed to weather.  
2304.12.2.6 Wood in contact with the ground or fresh water. Note specifically the limiting  
adjective fresh, which means this section only applies to wood in contact with the ground or  
fresh water. The water borne preservatives used for fresh water are not suitable for brackish or  
salt water, where attack can also come from marine borers. The first paragraph of this code  
section allows wood in direct contact with the earth to be naturally durable. However, this only  
applies to wood in contact with the ground, not posts or columns embedded in concrete. Posts  
and columns supporting permanent structures are required by Section 2304.12.2.6.1 to be  
preservative treated. It is also worth noting that an exception for wood entirely submerged in  
fresh water is provided. This exception acknowledges that the rate of decay is significantly  
reduced in the absence of free oxygen.  
2304.12.2.6.1 Posts or columns. Posts or columns embedded in concrete, such as columns in a  
post-frame building, where moisture tends to get trapped around the wood member, are subject  
to decay. Hence, they must be of preservative-treated wood.  
2304.12.2.7 Termite protection. Where termites are a significant hazard such as in some  
southern states, floor framing must be preservative treated, naturally durable, or have some other  
approved method of termite protection. Section 2603.8 has specific restrictions on the use of  
foam plastics in areas where the probability of termite infestation is very heavy, based on the  
termite infestation probability map shown in IBC Figure 2603.8. \(See Figure 2304-6.\) In areas  
where the probability of termite infestation is very heavy, naturally durable termite-resistant  
wood or preservative-treated wood must be used. This map is often updated due to the increasing  
spread of and threat from termites.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2304-6 Termite infestation probability map.  
2304.12.2.8 Wood used in retaining walls and cribs. Wood used in retaining walls, crib walls,  
bulkheads, and other walls that retain or support the earth must be of preservative-treated wood  
specified as ground-contact-treated wood. AWPA lists three categories for ground contact use\:  
General Use \(UC4A\), Heavy Duty \(UC4B\), and Extreme Duty \(UC4C\). Heavy Duty protection  
would be suitable for most circumstances. Extreme Duty would be appropriate in such locations  
as freshwater lake or pond side walls. AWPA has separate categories for use in marine  
\(saltwater\) environments.  
2304.12.3 Attic ventilation. Refer to the discussion under Section 1202.2 with regard to attic  
ventilation.  
2304.12.4 Under-floor ventilation \(crawl space\). Refer to the discussion under Section 1202.4  
with regard to under-floor ventilation.  
2304.13 Long-term loading. Wood structural members can exhibit long-term creep, which  
increases deflection, particularly where a high dead load is present. Additional deflection can  
cause severe cracking in the masonry or concrete. Under sustained loading, wood members  
exhibit additional time-dependent deformation \(creep\), which generally develops over long  
periods of time. The tabulated modulus of elasticity design values, E, in the NDS are intended to  
be used to estimate the immediate deformation under load. Where dead loads or sustained live  
loads represent a relatively high percentage of total design load, creep is an appropriate design  
consideration, which is addressed within the NDS. The total deflection under long-term loading  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationis estimated by increasing the initial deflection associated with the long-term load component by  
1.5 for seasoned lumber or 2.0 for unseasoned or wet lumber or glued-laminated timber. In either  
case, the total deflection, including the effects of long-term loading, are not to exceed those  
specified within Section 1604.3.1. An exception to the long-term loading check for nonstructural  
floor or roof surfacing, such as a gypcrete floor topping, is provided.  
Section 2305 General Design Requirements for Lateral-  
# Force-Resisting Systems  
Section 2305 has three subsections\: Section 2305.1 is general requirements; Section 2305.1.1  
contains a general requirement regarding openings in shear walls; Section 2305.2 contains  
provisions for calculating deflection of stapled diaphragms; and Section 2305.3 contains  
provisions for calculating deflection of stapled shear walls. All other requirements pertaining to  
lateral design of wood-framed structures are in the AWC SDPWS. The SDPWS standard  
provides complete requirements for design and construction of wood members, fasteners, and  
assemblies that resist lateral forces from wind and seismic loads \(Figure 2305-1\).  
Figure 2305-1 2021 Special Design Provisions for Wind and Seismic standard.  
2305.1 General. The section references the AWC SDPWS for design and construction of wood-  
frame shear walls or wood-frame diaphragms to resist wind, seismic, or other lateral loads.  
Provisions in Sections 2305, 2306, and 2307 are also required to the extent that they apply.  
2305.1.1 Openings in shear panels. This provision predates the perforated shear wall design  
method. Although the section requires that openings in shear walls that materially affect their  
strength be detailed and have their edges reinforced, the meaning of the phrase materially affect  
their strength is not defined in the code. It should also be noted that the perforated shear wall  
design method in SDPWS does permit openings in shear walls without force transfer design,  
provided certain requirements, adjustments, and restrictions are met.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2305.2 Diaphragm deflection. The SDPWS standard does not address deflection calculations  
for stapled diaphragms. Equation 23-1 includes the parameters necessary to calculate deflection  
of diaphragms fastened with staples. Stiffness properties \(apparent shear stiffness, kip/inch\) for  
diaphragms constructed of wood structural panels and lumber are given in SDPWS for purposes  
of complying with diaphragm classification, drift, and stiffness compatibility requirements  
specified in ASCE 7. See the SDPWS Commentary for detailed discussion of calculating  
diaphragm deflection.  
2305.3 Shear wall deflection. As noted earlier, the SDPWS standard does not address deflection  
of stapled shear walls. Equation 23-2 includes the parameters necessary to calculate deflection of  
shear walls fastened with staples. Stiffness properties \(apparent shear stiffness, kip/inch\) for  
shear walls constructed of wood structural panels and other materials are given in SDPWS for  
purposes of complying with drift and stiffness compatibility requirements specified in ASCE 7.  
Section 2306 Allowable Stress Design  
2306.1 Allowable stress design. The ANSI/AWC National Design Specification \(NDS\) for  
Wood Construction and Supplement is adopted by reference without any amendments \(see  
Figure 2306-1\). The NDS is an AWC standard developed by the AWC Wood Design Standards  
Committee. The IBC also references the AWC SDPWS in Sections 2305, 2306, and 2307.  
Figure 2306-1 2018 NDS and NDS Supplement.  
The standard for Shallow Post Foundation Design, ASABE EP486.2, provides a design  
procedure for shallow post foundations that resist moments and lateral and vertical forces. The  
standard includes definitions, material requirements, and design equations for designing post  
foundations. Additional referenced ASABE standards deal with diaphragm design of metal-clad  
post-frame buildings and mechanically laminated columns used in post-frame construction.  
APA—The Engineered Wood Association develops several standards for design of structural  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationglued-laminated timber and related recommendations for connection detailing, field notching and  
drilling and other application guidelines. APA also promulgates several standards and  
supplements for panel design.  
The Truss Plate Institute develops TPI 1, National Design Standard for Metal Plate Connected  
Wood Trusses as an ANSI standard. TPI 1 is the standard for the design, fabrication, quality  
control, and installation of light-frame metal-plate-connected wood trusses.  
AITC standards 104, 110, 113, 119, and 120 provide typical construction details, standard  
appearance grades and dimensions, hardwood specifications, and quality control systems for  
structural glued-laminated timber. These standards are all managed by the Pacific Lumber  
Inspection Bureau \(PLIB\).  
2306.1.1 Joists and rafters. Although the section indicates that rafters may be designed using  
the AWC STJR span tables, the intent is that both joists and rafters are permitted to be designed  
by the AWC STJR. The IBC references the latest edition of the AWC STJR and Design Values  
for Joists and Rafters which are available online from the American Wood Council at awc.org.  
2306.1.2 Plank and beam flooring. Plank and beam flooring may be designed in accordance  
with the AWC Wood Construction Data No. 4 \(WCD No. 4\), Wood Construction Data—Plank  
and Beam Framing for Residential Buildings. The WCD4 document is also available online from  
the American Wood Council at awc.org.  
2306.1.3 Treated wood stress adjustments. Several factors can significantly affect the physical  
properties of fire-retardent-treated wood \(FRTW\). These factors are the pressure treatment and  
redrying processes used, and the extremes of temperature and humidity that the FRTW will be  
subjected to once installed. The design values for FRTW must be adjusted for the effects of the  
treatment and environmental conditions, such as high temperature and humidity in attic  
installations. The design adjustment values must be based on an investigation procedure that  
includes subjecting the FRTW to similar temperatures and humidities, and which has been  
approved by the building official. The FRTW tested must be identical to that which is produced.  
The building official reviewing the test procedure must consider the species and grade of the  
untreated wood, and conditioning of the wood, such as drying before the fire-retardant-treatment  
process. Fire-retardant-wood treaters may choose to have their treatment process evaluated by  
ICC Evaluation Service and have an ESR issued that will assist the building official in  
determining compliance with the code.  
2306.1.4 Lumber decking. The capacity of lumber decking is arranged according to the various  
layup patterns described in Section 2304.9.2. Section 2306.1.4 gives the design capacity of  
lumber decking for moment and deflection according to the formulas given in Table 2306.1.4.  
2306.2 Wood-frame diaphragms. The term diaphragm refers to horizontal or sloping panel  
elements that resist and distribute lateral forces. \(Vertical panel elements that resist lateral forces  
are termed shear walls.\) See Section 202 for definitions of various types of diaphragms and  
diaphragm components. This section references the SDPWS for their design.  
Tables 2306.2\(1\) and 2306.2\(2\) contain allowable stress design \(ASD\) values for diaphragms  
fastened with staples because the SDPWS does not address stapled diaphragms. The design  
values given in the tables are based on Douglas fir-larch or southern pine framing. When the  
framing lumber is of a species other than Douglas fir-larch or southern pine, the tabular values  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmust be adjusted to account for the fastener behavior in framing members of other lumber  
species. The adjustments must be made in accordance with Footnote “a” of each table.  
High-load diaphragms are required to have special inspection in accordance with Section  
1705.5.1, as indicated in Footnote “g” of Table 2306.2\(2\). The footnote was added to the table as  
a cross reference to Chapter 17 so that code users are aware of the requirement for special  
inspection for high-load diaphragms. The figures accompanying Table 2306.2\(2\) show the  
various multi-row fastening patterns, required spacing, and staggering. These fastening diagrams  
are intended to clarify proper application of the table and are essential to develop the diaphragm  
shear values listed.  
Footnotes in the diaphragm and shear wall tables \[Table 2306.2\(1\), Table 2306.2\(2\), and  
Table 2306.3\(1\)\] provide the necessary factors to convert table values for shear loads of normal  
or permanent load duration as defined by the NDS. The factors reflect the fact that the values in  
the tables have a built-in load duration factor of 1.6. As such, to convert to a normal load  
duration of 1.00, the tabular value must be multiplied by 0.63 \(1.6 × 0.63 = 1.00\). To convert to a  
permanent load duration of 0.90, a factor of 0.56 must be used \(1.6 × 0.56 = 0.90\).  
Shear capacity modifications for wind loads. Section 2306.2 permits allowable shear  
capacities for wood diaphragms fastened with staples to be increased 40 percent for wind design.  
The 40-percent increase is permitted in Section 2306.2 for diaphragms and Section 2306.3 for  
wood-framed shear walls. The wind loads determined by ASCE 7 have changed over time, and  
research has provided a better understanding of how structures are affected by wind, and code-  
prescribed wind loads have been refined since the diaphragm and shear wall tables were  
originally developed. The design values in the tables include a 2.8 factor of safety. Because wind  
loads are essentially monotonic and bounded, a safety factor of 2 is deemed to be sufficient for  
wind loading. This results in a 40-percent increase in the tabulated values \(2.8 − 2.0/2.0 = 0.4\).  
This approach is consistent with SDPWS shear wall and diaphragm capacities for assemblies  
using nails to attach sheathing to framing.  
Diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms. The detailed requirements for diagonally sheathed  
lumber diaphragms are covered in SDPWS including nominal unit shear capacities for lumber  
sheathed diaphragms of single horizontal, single diagonal, and double diagonal sheathing.  
2306.2.1 Gypsum board diaphragm ceilings. Section 2508.6 allows the use of gypsum board  
ceiling diaphragms provided certain requirements and restrictions are met. For example, gypsum  
board ceiling diaphragms cannot be used to resist lateral forces resulting from concrete or  
masonry. The maximum diaphragm aspect ratio is 1½\:1, and cantilevered diaphragms and  
diaphragm rotation are not permitted.  
2306.3 Wood-frame shear walls. Where shear wall panels are fastened with staples, the IBC  
contains tables with allowable shear values for wood structural panels \[Table 2306.3\(1\)\],  
fiberboard \[Table 2306.3\(2\)\], and Portland cement plaster and gypsum materials \[Table  
2306.3\(3\)\].Requirements and limitations of SDPWS must also be met for shear walls where  
panels are fastened to framing members with staples. As noted in Footnote “e” of Table  
2306.3\(2\), fiberboard shear walls fastened with staples are not permitted to be used in Seismic  
Design Categories D, E, and F. The SDPWS restricts the use of particleboard and structural  
fiberboard shear walls to Seismic Design Categories A, B, and C and Portland cement plaster  
\(stucco\) and gypsum shear walls to Seismic Design Categories A, B, C, and D. Thus, only wood  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstructural panel shear walls are permitted to be used in Seismic Design Categories E and F.  
Maximum shear wall aspect ratios \(h/b\) are prescribed by the SDPWS. Blocked wood  
structural panel shear walls are limited to 3.5\:1 with unblocked set at 2\:1. See later discussion on  
aspect ratio capacity adjustments.  
The SDPWS has an exception allowing horizontal blocking to be omitted if specific  
conditions are met and shear capacity is reduced by the unblocked shear wall adjustment factor.  
As with diaphragms, the allowable shear wall capacities where wood structural panels are  
fastened to framing with staples are 40 percent higher than capacities used for seismic design.  
See earlier discussion on shear capacity modifications for wind loads.  
As previously noted, the IBC references the SDPWS, which covers design and construction  
requirements for wood members, fasteners, and assemblies designed to resist wind and seismic  
forces. Table 4.3A of the SDPWS gives nominal unit shear capacities for wood-frame shear  
walls sheathed with wood-based panels. Tabulated nominal unit shear capacities for wood-frame  
shear walls are applicable for both wind and seismic design for a given combination of  
sheathing, fastening schedule, and framing \(in prior editions, separate nominal values were  
tabulated for wind design and seismic design\). Coupled with this new tabulation of a single  
nominal unit shear capacity for wind and seismic are new ASD reduction factors and LRFD  
resistance factors for wind and seismic design.  
The IBC tables only contain design values for staples since SDPWS does not contain shear  
wall capacities for panels attached to framing with staples. The design values given in the IBC  
tables are based on Douglas fir-larch or southern pine framing. When the framing lumber is of a  
species other than Douglas fir-larch or southern pine, the tabular values must be adjusted to  
account for the fastener behavior in framing members of other lumber species. The adjustments  
must be made in accordance with Footnotes “a” and “b” of the wood structural panel and  
structural fiberboard tables, respectively.  
For wood structural panel shear walls utilizing staples, Footnotes “d” and “f” require 3-inch  
\(76 mm\) nominal or wider framing at adjoining panel edges where fastener spacing at panel  
edges is 2 inches \(51 mm\) on center or less, and where panels are applied to both faces, panel  
edge fastener spacing is less than 6 inches \(152 mm\) on center and panel joints are not offset  
from each other.  
Table 2306.3\(1\) Footnote “g” applies to wood structural panel shear walls in Seismic Design  
Categories D, E, and F. All framing members receiving edge fastening from abutting panels must  
be 3-inch \(76 mm\) nominal when the shear design value exceeds 350 pounds per linear foot \(5.1  
kN/m\) \(ASD\). Note that two 2-inch \(51 mm\) nominal members fastened together to transfer  
shear between framing members in accordance with the NDS is an acceptable alternative. Both  
panel joint and sill plate fasteners must be staggered to prevent splitting. SDPWS requires 3-inch  
\(76 mm\) square by 0.229-inch-thick \(5.8 mm\) square plate washers with some exceptions. A  
standard cut washer can be used where all of the following are met\: Anchor bolts are designed to  
resist shear only; the full-height segment design method is used; hold-downs are designed  
without considering any dead load to resist overturning; the shear wall aspect ratio does not  
exceed 2\:1; and the nominal shear capacity of the shear wall does not exceed 1370 plf \(20.0  
kN/m\) \(which translates to an ASD capacity of 490 plf \(7.2 kN/m\) for seismic and 685 plf \(10.0  
kN/m\) for wind\).  
Lumber sheathed shear walls. Provisions covering lumber sheathed shear walls are located in  
the SDPWS including construction requirements for single and double layer diagonally sheathed  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationshear walls, shear walls horizontally sheathed with a single layer of lumber and shear walls  
sheathed with vertical board siding. The SDPWS only permits diagonally sheathed lumber shear  
walls in Seismic Design Categories A, B, C, and D. Shear walls horizontally sheathed with a  
single layer of lumber and shear walls sheathed with vertical board siding are limited to SDC A,  
B, and C. All lumber sheathed shear walls may be used for wind design.  
Particleboard shear walls. Particleboard shear walls are covered in the SDPWS and are  
permitted to resist wind loads. However, the SDPWS only permits particleboard shear walls in  
buildings in Seismic Design Categories A, B, and C. Particleboard used for shear walls must  
conform to ANSI A208.1. Note that particleboard shear walls have a maximum aspect ratio of  
2\:1.  
Structural fiberboard shear walls. Structural fiberboard shear walls are addressed in the  
SDPWS and are also permitted to resist wind loads. However, the SDPWS only permits  
structural fiberboard shear walls in buildings in Seismic Design Categories A, B, and C.  
Fiberboard used for shear walls must conform to ASTM C208. Comparable to wood structural  
panel shear walls, SDPWS allows fiberboard shear walls to have an aspect ratio of up to 3.5\:1.  
Shear Wall Capacity Adjustments. The SDPWS includes adjustments where the shear capacity  
is reduced by the Aspect Ratio Factor for wind and seismic design. The Aspect Ratio Factor  
applies for structural fiberboard when the aspect ratio exceeds 1\:1. It applies to wood structural  
panels when the aspect ratio exceeds 2\:1. The Aspect Ratio Factors for wood structural panels  
and structural fiberboard are shown in Table 2306-1 for an 8-foot \(2,838 mm\) tall shear wall.  
Table 2306-1. Shear Wall Aspect Ratio Factors for 8-Foot Shear Wall Height  
Shear walls sheathed with other materials. Shear walls composed of cement plaster and  
gypsum materials are covered in the SDPWS. The detailed construction requirements for  
gypsum board, gypsum base for veneer plaster, water-resistant gypsum backing board, gypsum  
sheathing board, gypsum lath and plaster, and Portland cement plaster shear walls are in SDPWS  
and IBC Chapter 25. Applicable ASTM standards for the various types of materials are given in  
SDPWS. The SDPWS permits cement plaster and gypsum shear walls to be used for wind loads  
and in Seismic Design Categories A, B, C, and D. Shear walls using these materials are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconsidered brittle \(nonductile\), and as such the strength and stiffness of both plaster and gypsum  
shear walls decrease significantly under a limited number of cycles when subjected to seismic  
demands.  
Cross-laminated Timber Shear Wall Systems. SDPWS contains design and detailing  
provisions for cross-laminated timber \(CLT\) shear wall systems that can be used to resist wind  
and seismic loads. There are two main categories of CLT-based lateral resisting systems that  
have been actively investigated by researchers around the world since the introduction of this  
mass timber material. The first type of system is suited for platform-style construction, utilizing  
CLT panels as shear walls. System strength is provided through nailed connectors at CLT panel  
edges. Yielding of the nails and metal connectors, and combined rocking and sliding behavior of  
individual panels, produces the system’s ductile response. The CLT wall panel is designed to  
resist overturning induced compression forces and uses either continuous hold-down rods or  
conventional hold-downs at shear wall ends to resist overturning induced tension forces. This  
system is codified in SDPWS \(see Table 2306-2 for wind and seismic applications\). The second  
type of CLT-based lateral resisting system is a rocking wall system that can achieve self-  
centering and energy dissipation through a variety of designed components. Using CLT  
components in seismic force-resisting systems is an area of considerable ongoing research.  
Seismic design coefficients for CLT shear wall systems are expected to be provided in ASCE 7-  
22.  
Table 2306-2. Cross-Laminated Timber Shear Wall Capacities  
Seismic considerations. Technical provisions for seismic design are covered in the ASCE 7  
standard. The IBC only contains the design criteria for environmental loads such as seismic and  
wind. Shear walls resisting seismic loads are subject to the limitations in Section 12.2.1 and  
Table 12.2-1 of ASCE 7. Similar requirements applicable to the simplified seismic provisions are  
found in Section 12.14 and Table 12.14-1. Tables 12.2-1 and 12.14-1 contain two types of wood-  
frame shear walls\: light-frame \(wood\) walls sheathed with wood structural panels rated for shear  
resistance, and light-frame walls with shear panels of all other materials. See Items 15 and 17 of  
ASCE 7 Table 12.2-1 under bearing wall systems. For light-frame shear walls sheathed with  
materials other than wood structural panels, Table 12.2-1 assigns a response modification factor  
of 2 and restricts the height of the building to 35 feet \(10,668 mm\) in Seismic Design Category  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationD. Also, these shear walls are not permitted to be used to resist seismic forces in Seismic Design  
Category E or F. Further, since ASCE 7 references SDPWS for detailing requirements, and since  
SDPWS does not permit certain shear wall materials such as particle board and structural  
fiberboard to be used in Seismic Design Category D, that would limit use of those shear wall  
materials to Seismic Design Categories A through C. The ASCE 7 standard also limits light-  
frame wood walls sheathed with wood structural panels to a building height of 65 feet \(19,812  
mm\) in Seismic Design Categories D, E, and F. Table 2306-3 provides a summary of these  
requirements.  
Table 2306-3. Summary of Different Types of Wood-Frame Shear Wall System Limitations  
Based on Seismic Design Category  
Section 2307 Load and Resistance Factor Design  
2307.1 General. The section references the NDS and SDPWS for load and resistance factor  
design \(LRFD\) of wood structures. Both are dual format standards that permit ASD and LRFD  
procedures. The NDS approach is to tabulate reference \(ASD\) capacities for wood members and  
connections. The following discussion, adapted from the NDS Commentary, provides an  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationoverview of the LRFD design approach.  
The approach of adjusting a reference value in accordance with the applicable adjustment  
factors to arrive at either an ASD- or LRFD-adjusted design value is illustrated in the  
following example for sawn lumber bending stress, Fb\:  
where\:  
Format conversion factors convert reference design values \(allowable stress design values  
based on normal load duration\) to LRFD reference resistances. Resistance factors are assigned  
to various wood properties with only one factor assigned to each stress mode \(i.e., bending,  
shear, compression, tension, and stability\). In general, the magnitude of the resistance factor is  
considered to, in part, reflect relative variability of wood product properties. Actual  
differences in product variability are accounted for in the derivation of reference design  
values. Both format conversion factors and resistance factors are determined per ASTM  
D5457.  
The time effect factor, λ \(LRFD counterpart to the ASD load duration factor, CD\), varies by  
load combination and is intended to establish a consistent target reliability index for load  
scenarios represented by applicable load combinations. Except for the load combination for  
dead load only, each load combination can be viewed as addressing load scenarios involving  
peak values of one or more “primary” loads in combination with other transient loads. Specific  
time effect factors for various ASCE 7 load combinations are largely dependent on the  
magnitude, duration, and variation of the primary load in each combination.  
The reduced probability of the simultaneous occurrence of combinations of various loads  
on a structure, such as dead, live, wind, snow, and earthquake, is recognized for both ASD and  
LRFD in the IBC and ASCE 7. Specific load reductions for ASD or load combinations for  
LRFD apply when multiple transient loads act simultaneously.  
All modifications for load combinations are entirely separate from adjustments for load  
duration, CD, or time effect, λ, which are directly applicable to wood design values. It should  
be emphasized that reduction of design loads to account for the probability of simultaneous  
occurrence of loads and the adjustment of wood resistances to account for the effect of the  
duration of the applied loads are independent of each other and both adjustments are  
applicable in the design calculation.  
The SDPWS approach for shear walls and diaphragms is to tabulate “nominal strength”  
values. As discussed earlier in Sections 2306.2,  
“Wood-frame diaphragms,  
” and 2306.3,  
“Wood-  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationframe shear walls,  
” nominal strength \(or nominal capacity\) is used to provide a common  
reference point from which to derive ASD or LRFD reference design values. LRFD resistance  
factors for sheathing in-plane shear, sheathing out-of-plane bending, and connections are  
determined per ASTM D5457. Since time effect factors, λ, for load combinations including wind  
and seismic loads are set to a short-term \(10-minute\) baseline, a value of unity is assumed.  
Section 2308 Conventional Light-Frame Construction  
Introduction. Where engineering is provided, the designer is required to determine all  
applicable gravity and lateral loads that act on the structure, and design and detail the various  
structural systems to resist these loads.  
A key feature of the conventional construction provisions is in this statement\: “Other methods  
may be used provided a satisfactory design is submitted showing compliance with other  
provisions of this code.  
” In other words, one need not conform to the restrictions, limitations,  
and requirements of the provisions if a design is submitted to the jurisdiction that conforms to the  
engineering requirements of the code.  
2308.1 General. The provisions of Section 2308 provide prescriptive construction details and  
methods for light-frame wood construction. Light-frame wood construction consists of 2x  
construction with walls of 2-inch-nominal-thickness \(51 mm\) studs typically spaced at 16 or 24  
inches \(406 or 610 mm\) on center, and roofs and floors framed of 2-inch-nominal-thickness \(51  
mm\) rafters or joists spaced at 12, 16, or 24 inches \(305, 406, or 610 mm\) on center.  
Construction that meets the restrictions, limitations, and prescriptive provisions of Section 2308  
is deemed to comply with the intent of the code without requiring engineering. Perhaps most  
important is Section 2308.2, which contains the specific restrictions and limitations for the  
conventional construction provisions.  
Detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses not more than three stories in height  
with a separate means of egress are specifically within the scope of the IRC. Only buildings that  
are within the scope of the IBC and Section 2308.2 are permitted to use the conventional  
construction provisions of Section 2308. However, the IRC requires structural elements that do  
not conform to the limits of the IRC to be designed in accordance with accepted engineering  
practice under the engineering provisions of the IBC. Section 2309 also permits compliance with  
the AWC Wood Frame Construction Manual \(WFCM\) as an alternative. Tables 2308-1 and  
2308-2 compare scoping provisions of the IRC, IBC Section 2308 and the WFCM, all of which  
contain prescriptive light-frame wood construction provisions. While each of these three  
documents permit or even provide engineered solutions for light-frame wood construction, the  
discussion here is limited to prescriptive provisions. Consult each of the codes and the WFCM  
for exceptions and additional details. Prescriptive wood provisions are applicable to all use  
groups in the IBC in accordance with the scoping limitations of IBC Section 2308 and the  
WFCM.  
Table 2308-1. Applications for Prescriptive Light-Frame Wood Construction Provisions  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTable 2308-2. Scoping Provisions for the IRC, IBC 2308, and IBC 2309  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2308.1.1 Portions exceeding limitations of conventional light-frame construction. In this  
case, portions of a building as well as the supporting load path must be designed in accordance  
with accepted engineering practice and provisions of the code. In this section, the term portions  
does not refer to structural elements but to parts of the building that contain volume and area  
such as a room or a series of rooms. See Section 2308.8 regarding design of elements or  
members that exceed the limitations of conventional construction.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2308.1.2 Connections and fasteners. This section refers back to Section 2304.10 for  
requirements for fasteners used in conventionally constructed wood-frame buildings.  
2308.2 Limitations. One of the most important aspects of most prescriptive methods is meeting  
restrictions and limitations required to use the method. The structures for which conventional  
construction is applicable are described in this section. The limitations are broken into categories  
as follows\: \(1\) maximum number of stories, \(2\) maximum floor-to-floor height, \(3\) maximum  
dead, live, and snow loads, \(4\) maximum basic wind speed, \(5\) maximum roof span, \(6\) risk  
category and highest permissible seismic design category.  
2308.2.1 Stories. Table 2308.2.1 restricts the building height to three stories above grade plane  
in Seismic Design Category A and B. The table further restricts the building height to two stories  
above grade plane in Seismic Design Category C, and one story above grade plane in Seismic  
Design Categories D and E. In Seismic Design Category D or E, cripple walls exceeding 14  
inches \(356 mm\) are considered a story for the purposes of determining the number of stories.  
Note that cripple walls exceeding 14 inches \(356 mm\) high in structures classified in any seismic  
design category are considered an additional story for purposes of bracing as indicated in Section  
2308.6.6\. Typical conventional raised-floor construction generally uses post and girder  
construction to support the floor joists within the interior of the structure. Because interior braced  
wall lines may not necessarily extend down to the foundation, lateral loads must be transferred  
through exterior cripple walls to the foundation. Because cripple walls are at the lowest level of  
the structure, they are the most heavily loaded, relative to the braced panel walls. Thus, cripple  
walls are very important to satisfactory performance of the structure when subjected to lateral  
loads from wind pressure or earthquake ground motion. By classifying cripple walls exceeding  
the 14-inch \(356 mm\) limit as a story, higher bracing strength criteria may be required to resist  
the higher lateral loads.  
2308.2.2 Allowable floor-to-floor height. There are two conditions\: a maximum floor-to-floor  
height of 11 foot 7 inches \(3,531 mm\) and a maximum bearing wall stud height of 10 feet \(3,048  
mm\). See Figure 2308-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-1 Maximum floor-to-floor height.  
2308.2.3 Allowable loads. Section 2308.2.3 limits the average dead load to 15 psf \(718 N/m2\)  
for roofs and exterior walls, floors, and partitions combined. There are two exceptions\: \(1\) stone  
or masonry veneer up to the lesser of 5 inches \(127 mm\) thick or 50 psf \(2,395 N/m2\) is  
permitted to a height of 30 feet \(9,144 mm\) above a noncombustible foundation with an  
additional 8 feet \(2,438 mm\) permitted for gable ends, and \(2\) concrete or masonry fireplaces,  
heaters, and chimneys are permitted.  
2308.2.4 Basic wind speed. Buildings located in hurricane-prone region such as along the U.S.  
Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico coasts or in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, and  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAmerican Samoa cannot use this section when wind speeds are greater than 130 mph \(57 m/s\).  
See Section 202 for definition of hurricane-prone region.  
Where the basic wind speed, V, exceeds 130 mph \(57 m/s\), special details are necessary to  
resist the higher wind pressures and ensure adequate load path continuity. Exceptions allow use  
of the conventional light-frame construction provisions for buildings in Exposure Category B  
areas with wind speeds up to 140 mph \(63 m/s\) if the area is not a hurricane-prone regions.  
Additionally, buildings in areas with wind speeds exceeding 130 mph \(57 m/s\) may use AWC’s  
Wood Frame Construction Manual or ICC 600, Standard for Residential Construction in High-  
wind Regions.  
2308.2.5 Allowable roof span. The provisions indicate that a ridge board is not to be  
misconstrued as being a point of vertical support. Conventionally framed roofs with ridge board,  
rafters, and ceiling joists behave similar to trusses, spanning from wall to wall, with the rafter in  
compression and the ceiling joist in tension. A structural ridge beam, on the other hand, is  
designed to support vertical loads \(reactions\) from the rafters and as such is considered a point of  
vertical support. See Figure 2308-2.  
Figure 2308-2 Typical rafter framing with ridge board.  
2308.2.6 Risk category limitation. The conventional construction provisions are not permitted  
to be used for structures in Risk Category IV assigned to seismic design category B, C, D, or F.  
Risk categories are determined from Table 1604.5 based on the use of the structure. The seismic  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdesign category of a structure is determined based on the risk category \(Section 1613.2.5\), site  
class or soil properties \(Section 1613.2.2\), and potential earthquake ground motion \(Section  
1613.2.4 spectral response accelerations\) at the site.  
2308.3 Foundations and footings. This section references Chapter 18 for foundation design,  
which includes prescriptive footings for light-frame construction in Section 1809.7 and  
prescriptive foundation walls in Section 1807.1.6.  
2308.3.1 Foundation plates or sills. Prescriptive requirements for foundation plates and  
anchorage are given in this section, although these provisions apply only to conventional  
construction. The requirements in Section 2304.3.1 apply to both engineered and conventional  
construction. Foundation \(footing\) requirements for light-frame construction are contained in  
Section 1809.7.  
Typical sill anchorage is ½-inch-diameter \(12.7 mm\) bolts spaced not more than 6 feet \(1,829  
mm\) on center, or 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) on center for structures over two stories above grade. The  
phrase “or approved foundation anchor straps load-rated … and spaced to provide equivalent  
anchorage” is based on cyclic testing of walls using foundation anchor straps that showed they  
perform well under cyclic loading.  
2308.3.1.1 Braced wall line sill plate anchorage in Seismic Design Category D. The  
requirement for plate washers originated in response to the extensive splitting of wood sills  
during the Northridge earthquake. The splitting was caused by a variety of factors including  
cross-grain tension and oversized holes for anchor bolts, in addition to splitting from insufficient  
edge distance in heavily loaded walls. Subsequent cyclic testing of wood shear wall assemblies  
showed that use of 2-inch by 2-inch by 3/16-inch, or larger, steel plate washers at the anchor  
bolts helps prevent the sill from splitting.  
The IBC requires 3 × 3 × 0.229 inch \(76.2 × 76.2 × 5.8 mm\) plate washers. The hole in the  
plate washer is permitted to be diagonally slotted with a width up to 3/16-inch \(81.0 mm\) wider  
than the bolt diameter and a slot length up to 1¾ inches \(44.5 mm\), provided a standard cut  
washer is used between the square plate washer and the nut. The IBC, within this section, allows  
the use of not less than ½-inch diameter \(12.7 mm\) anchor bolts.  
2308.3.1.2 Braced wall line sill plate anchorage in Seismic Design Category E. Similar to  
Section 2308.3.1.1, this section calls for the use of plate washers and diagonally slotted holes  
with the same dimensions and tolerances. Unlike Seismic Design Category D, Seismic Design  
Category E requires not less than ⅝-inch diameter anchor bolts.  
2308.4 Floor framing. The section provides prescriptive framing requirements for girders and  
floor joists.  
2308.4.1 Girders. The section allows the use of a 4 × 6 \(102 mm × 152 mm\) girder for spans not  
more than 6 feet \(1,829 mm\) and spacing not more than 8 feet \(2,438 mm\). Girders require a  
minimum of 1½ inches \(38 mm\) of bearing on wood or metal and 3 inches \(76 mm\) of bearing  
on concrete or masonry. The design of girders to support floor loads involves so many variables  
that the tables in the code are only applicable to the most simple cases. In many cases, girders  
should be engineered because of unusual configurations or loading conditions. Figures 2308-3  
and 2308-4 show details deemed to comply with the splice and tie requirements for posts and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationgirders.  
Figure 2308-3 Post-to-girder connection.  
Figure 2308-4 Post-to-girder connection.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2308.4.2 Floor joists. The floor joist span tables in the IBC are excerpted from the AWC span  
tables for joists and rafters. Joists selected from these tables are deemed to comply with code  
requirements for both strength and deflection. Table 2308.4.2.1\(1\) is for a floor live load of 30  
psf \(1,436 N/m2\) because Table 1607.1 allows a 30 psf \(1,436 N/m2\) floor live load in residential  
one- and two-family sleeping areas and habitable attics.  
2308.4.2.2 Bearing. The code requires a minimum of 1½ inches \(38 mm\) of bearing on wood or  
metal and 3 inches \(76.2 mm\) of bearing on concrete or masonry. The 1 × 4 \(25.4 × 101.6 mm\)  
ribbon \(ledger\) nailed with 3–16d common nails to the studs was common in older balloon-  
framed multistory structures but is very uncommon today. Figures 2308-5 and 2308-6 illustrate  
minimum bearing requirements.  
Figure 2308-5 Joists bearing on concrete or masonry.  
Figure 2308-6 Bearing requirements.  
2308.4.2.3 Framing details. This section contains basic requirements for framing floor joist  
systems to provide lateral support at joist ends. Figure 2308-7 depicts the provisions for support  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationby solid blocking or other means. Figure 2308-8 depicts the requirements for lapping and tying  
joists over a beam or partition.  
Figure 2308-7 Framing details.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-8 Floor joists tied over wood beam, girder, or partition.  
2308.4.2.4 Notches and holes. Figure 2308-9 illustrates limits on notches or bored holes in  
joists.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-9 Cut, notched, or bored holes.  
2308.4.3 Engineered wood products. This section specifically prohibits cuts, notches, and holes  
bored in trusses, structural composite lumber, structural glued-laminated timber, or I-joists,  
unless specifically permitted by the manufacturer or where the registered design professional has  
considered their effects on the stiffness and capacity of the member and verified the  
modification.  
2308.4.4 Framing around openings. Figure 2308-10 depicts acceptable framing details for  
openings not greater than 4 feet \(1,219 mm\). Figure 2308-11 depicts acceptable framing for  
openings greater than 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) but not greater than 6 feet \(1,829 mm\). Figure 2308-12  
shows framing and hangers for openings greater than 6 feet \(1,829 mm\).  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-10 Framing around openings—header span ≤ 4 feet.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-11 Framing around openings header \> 4 feet but ≤ 6 feet.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-12 Framing around opening—header span ≤ 6 feet.  
2308.4.4.1 Openings in floor diaphragms in Seismic Design Categories B, C, D, and E. This  
limitation attempts to place a practical limit on the size of openings in floor diaphragms. See  
Section 2308.7.6.1 for detailing requirements for permitted openings in roof diaphragms. In  
Seismic Design Categories other than A, openings in floor diaphragms with a dimension greater  
than 4 feet require metal ties and blocking as shown in Figure 2308.4.4.1\(1\). The section  
prescribes specific requirements for straps, blocking, and nailing to reinforce the boundaries of  
the opening. In Seismic Design Categories D and E, the dimensions of openings in floor  
diaphragms are limited to 50 percent of the distance between braced wall lines or an area greater  
than 25 percent of the area between orthogonal pairs of braced wall lines as shown in Figure  
2308.4.4.1\(2\). If the restrictions are not met, then the diaphragm and opening reinforcement must  
be designed to resist lateral forces in accordance with accepted engineering practice.  
2308.4.4.2 Vertical offsets in floor diaphragms in Seismic Design Categories D and E . This  
limitation results from observation of damage that is somewhat unique to split-level wood-frame  
construction. If floors on either side of an offset move in opposite directions because of  
earthquake ground motion or wind loading, the short bearing wall in the middle becomes  
unstable and vertical support for the upper joists can be lost, resulting in a collapse. If the vertical  
offset is limited to a dimension equal to or less than the joist depth, and a simple strap tie directly  
connecting joists on different levels can be provided, then the instability is eliminated. In Seismic  
Design Categories D and E, portions of floor levels cannot be vertically offset such that the  
framing members on either side cannot be adequately tied together as shown in Figure  
2308.4.4.2\. The exception permits the framing to be supported directly by foundations in lieu of  
being lapped and tied directly together. If the restrictions cannot be met, then the diaphragm and  
offset irregularity must be designed to resist lateral forces in accordance with accepted  
engineering practice.  
2308.4.5 Joists supporting bearing partitions. Figure 2308-13 depicts the requirement for  
joists supporting bearing partitions when partitions are parallel and perpendicular to supporting  
joists.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-13 Supporting bearing partitions.  
2308.4.6 Lateral support. Rectangular members such as floor and ceiling joists require lateral  
support to avoid buckling in the weak direction. The requirements are based on the nominal  
depth-to-thickness \(d/b\) rather than the actual dimensions of the member. Thus, a 2 × 12 has a  
d/b ratio equal to 12/2 = 6. Figure 2308-14 depicts the lateral support requirements for 2 × 12  
and deeper joists unless both edges of the member are held in line by sheathing.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-14 Lateral support requirements for 2 × 12 and deeper joists.  
2308.4.7 Structural floor sheathing. This section references Section 2304.8.1 which references  
Tables 2304.8\(1\) through 2304.8\(4\) for installation requirements for floor sheathing. Flooring  
systems may consist of a subfloor on which may be placed an underlayment for the floor  
covering or a combined subfloor and underlayment system, upon which a finished floor-  
surfacing material is applied. The finished floor-surfacing material may be wood-strip flooring,  
tongue-and-groove flooring, or various types of resilient floor coverings such as vinyl, tile or  
carpet. For the noncombined subfloor and underlayment system, underlayment is required to  
provide a smooth, even surface to which the finished flooring will be attached. However, in some  
cases, the underlayment is required to add strength to the subflooring.  
Allowable spans and minimum grade requirements for lumber subflooring are in Tables  
2304.8\(1\) and 2304.8\(2\). The span tables are based on the thickness of the floor sheathing, the  
orientation of the sheathing with respect to the joists \(either perpendicular or diagonal\), and the  
board grade of the lumber being used \(see Figure 2308-15\).  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-15 Typical details—lumber or wood structural panel subfloor.  
Wood structural panels may be manufactured for use as either structural subflooring or  
combined subfloor-underlayment. See Tables 2304.8\(3\) and 2304.8\(4\). The allowable spans for  
structural subflooring and combined subfloor-underlayment are based on the wood structural  
panel’s face grain \(strength axis\) being continuous over two or more spans with the face grain  
perpendicular to the supports \(see Figure 2308-15\). To create a stiffer floor and prevent or  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationminimize squeaking of the floor system after the building has been in use, the subfloor may be  
glued to the joists. This gluing prevents the relative movement between the panel and the joist  
that takes place when loads are placed on the floor, and provides additional stiffness.  
Particleboard can be used as underlayment, structural subflooring, or as combined subfloor-  
underlayment. Where used as underlayment, the code permits Type PBU particleboard in  
accordance with ANSI A208.1. See Section 2303.1.8.  
2308.4.8 Under-floor ventilation. See discussion of Section 1202.4 in regard to under-floor  
ventilation requirements.  
2308.4.9 Floor framing supporting braced wall panels. This section references Section  
2308.6.7, Connections of braced wall panels, for construction requirements for braced wall  
panels that are supported by floor framing such as cantilevered floors or set backs from the floor  
joist support.  
2308.4.10 Anchorage of exterior means of egress components in Seismic Design Categories  
D and E. To prevent possible collapse of means of egress components such as exterior egress  
balconies and exterior exit stairways, positive anchorage to the main structure is required by this  
section. Anchors must be spaced at no more than 8 feet on center. If anchorage to the main  
structure is not provided, then the egress component itself must be designed to resist seismic load  
effects. Toenails and nails in withdrawal are not permitted because past experience has shown  
that they do not perform well when subjected to cyclic loads from seismic demands.  
2308.5 Wall construction. This section contains typical framing requirements for  
conventionally framed stud walls.  
2308.5.1 Stud size, height, and spacing. Figure 2308-16 depicts typical stud requirements for  
bearing walls. Wall studs must be continuous from a support at the sole plate to a support at the  
top plate to resist out-of-plane loads perpendicular to the wall. The requirement does not apply to  
trimmers \(king studs\), jack studs and cripple studs at openings in walls. Where scissor trusses are  
used to create a vaulted ceiling, a scissor truss is often used at the gable end wall, and the top  
plate is not laterally supported because the ceiling follows the profile of the bottom chord of the  
truss. See Figure 2308-17. Where scissor trusses are used to create a vaulted ceiling profile, the  
gable end wall studs should be balloon framed up to the truss bottom chord or to the roof  
sheathing. If the studs are not supported at the top by a ceiling or roof deck in accordance with  
this requirement, then an engineered design should be provided for the gable end wall studs studs  
to resist out-of-plane \(component and cladding\) wind loads perpendicular to the wall.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-16 Stud requirements for bearing walls.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-17 Vaulted ceiling at gable wall.  
2308.5.2 Framing details. Studs are required to be placed with their wide dimension  
perpendicular to the plane of the wall for maximum out-of-plane strength and stiffness. Not less  
than three studs are installed at each corner of exterior walls, although the exception allows two  
stud corners under specific conditions.  
2308.5.3 Plates or sills. The section prescribes requirements for bottom plates and sills, and top  
plates in conventional stud framed walls.  
2308.5.3.1 Bottom plate or sill. Studs are required to have full bearing on a 2-inch \(51 mm\)  
nominal bottom plate or sill at least as wide as the supported stud.  
2308.5.3.2 Top plates. Top plate splices require face nails on each side of the 4-foot \(1,219 mm\)  
lapped joint. The 16d common nails or other equivalent fasteners are required by Item 13 of  
Table 2304.10.2. Single plate butt-joint splices must have at least twelve 8d box nails on each  
side of the splice with a 3-inch-wide by 12-inch-long by 0.036-inch-thick \(76 mm by 305 mm by  
0.91 mm\) steel strap. Corners and intersecting walls require only half the number of nails needed  
for a butt-joint splice. Figure 2308-18 depicts the double top plate splice requirement; Figure  
2308-19 depicts the recommended single top plate splice.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-18 Double top plate splice.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-19 Single top plate butt-joint splice—bearing and exterior walls.  
Top plates for studs spaced at 24 inches. The code has specific requirements where bearing  
wall studs are spaced 24 inches \(610 mm\) on center. Figure 2308-20 depicts the requirements for  
locating the joists or trusses where studs are spaced 24 inches \(610 mm\) on center.  
Figure 2308-20 Top plate—bearing location limitations.  
2308.5.4 Nonload-bearing walls and partitions. This section allows for increased stud spacing  
on nonload-bearing walls, and studs may be turned with the long dimension parallel to the wall  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfor construction of plumbing chases. See Section 202 for definition of nonload-bearing wall. \(For  
wood-frame construction, a nonload-bearing wall is a stud wall that supports 100 plf \(1,459 N/m\)  
or less superimposed vertical load.\) Note that sheathing materials might require increased  
thickness when wider stud spacing is used. Partitions must be capped with at least a single top  
plate to provide overlapping at corners and at intersections with other walls and partitions. Single  
top plates need to be continuously tied at joints by 16-inch-long \(406 mm\) solid blocking equal  
to the plate size, or by ½-inch by 1½-inch \(12.7 mm by 38 mm\) metal ties fastened with two 16d  
nails on each side of the joint.  
2308.5.5 Openings in walls and partitions. The section provides prescriptive requirements for  
conventionally framed openings in exterior and interior walls and partitions.  
2308.5.5.1 Openings in exterior bearing walls. Headers over openings in walls are required to  
carry loads from the wall, floors, and roof above. Allowable header spans for exterior bearing  
walls are given in Table 2308.4.1.1\(1\). The table gives the minimum header size, allowable span,  
and number of jack studs required for various ground snow loads and building widths. The 30-  
psf \(1.44 kN/m2\) ground snow load is also to be used for sizing headers with roof live loads of 20  
psf \(0.96 kN/m2\) or less or ground snow loads less than 30 psf \(1.44 kN/m2\) \(see Footnote “e”\).  
The permissible species for lumber are given in the heading on the table \(Douglas-Fir Larch,  
Hem-Fir, Southern Pine, and Spruce-Pine-Fir\), and the minimum grade of lumber \(No. 2\) is  
specified in Footnote “b.  
” Multiple members must be fastened together in accordance with the  
prescriptive fastening Table 2304.10.2. Headers selected in accordance with Table 2308.4.1.1\(1\)  
may only be used for structures that fit within the parameters of the table. Headers for other  
configurations or loading conditions must be designed in accordance with the engineering  
provisions of the code.  
Note that the table only includes 2x dimension lumber members. On the West Coast, 4x and  
6x headers are common. Span tables that include 4x and 6x members are available from wood  
industry sources such as the Western Wood Products Association \(WWPA\). AWC’s Wood  
Frame Construction Manual also includes header and girder span tables for both dimension  
lumber and structural glued-laminated timber members. Use of structural composite lumber in  
header applications is also prevalent and span tables are available in manufacturers’ literature  
and evaluation reports by ICC. Figure 2308-21 illustrates typical header framing requirements.  
Headers supported by jack studs as required by Table 2308.4.1.1\(1\) must have a minimum of 1½  
inches \(38 mm\) of bearing at the supports. Where the number of required jack studs equals one,  
the header is permitted to be supported by an approved framing anchor attached to the full-height  
wall stud and to the header.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-21 Laterally unsupported header over wall opening.  
Single-member headers of nominal 2-inch \(51 mm\) thickness are also addressed in this  
section stating they shall be framed with a single flat 2-inch-nominal \(51 mm\) member or wall  
plate not less in width than the wall studs on the top and bottom of the header. Figures  
2308.5.5.1\(1\) and 2308.5.5.1\(2\) illustrate these requirements.  
Spans are calculated assuming the top of the header or girder is laterally braced by  
perpendicular framing. Where the top of the header or girder is not laterally braced \(for example,  
cripple studs bearing on the header\), Table 2308.4.1.1\(1\) note “f” indicates that tabulated spans  
for headers consisting of 2 × 8, 2 × 10, or 2 × 12 sizes shall be multiplied by 0.70 or the header  
or girder shall be designed. AWC’s Wood Frame Construction Manual contains header and  
girder tables for “dropped” and “raised” conditions that correspond to laterally unbraced and  
laterally braced headers, respectively. See Figure 2308-22 for examples of dropped versus raised  
headers.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-22 Examples of dropped versus raised headers \(courtesy American Wood  
Council\).  
2308.5.5.2 Openings in interior-bearing partitions. Allowable header spans for interior-  
bearing walls supporting floor loads are given in Table 2308.4.1.1\(2\). The table gives the  
minimum header size, allowable span, and number of jack studs required. Headers selected in  
accordance with Table 2308.4.1.1\(2\) may be used only for structures that fit within the  
parameters of the table. Headers for other configurations or loading conditions must be designed  
in accordance with the engineering provisions of the code. Headers supported by jack studs as  
required by Table 2308.4.1.1\(1\) or Table 2308.4.1.1\(2\) must have a minimum of 1½ inches of  
bearing at the supports.  
2308.5.5.3 Openings in interior-nonbearing partitions. Interior-nonbearing walls can have  
single studs at each end of headers with a minimum of 1½ inches of bearing at each support.  
2308.5.6 Cripple walls. Foundation cripple walls are required to be framed of studs not less than  
the size of the studs above. Exterior cripple wall studs are to be not less than 14 inches \(356 mm\)  
in length or be framed of solid blocking. When cripple wall studs exceed 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) in  
height, they must be framed of studs having the size required for an additional story. Specific  
requirements for cripple wall bracing are found in Section 2308.6.6.  
2308.5.7 Bridging. Where stud partitions do not have adequate sheathing to brace the studs  
laterally in their weak \(smaller\) dimension, and the studs have a height-to-least-thickness ratio  
exceeding 50, the studs are required to have bridging or solid blocking with a minimum nominal  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthickness of 2 inches \(51 mm\) and a width the same as the studs. This blocking should be  
installed at intervals that reduce the height-to-least-thickness ratio below 50. For 2x studs, this  
translates to 75 inches \(1,905 mm\) and for 3x studs, 125 inches \(3,175 mm\).  
2308.5.8 Pipes in walls. This section provides requirements for framing walls with pipes such as  
plumbing walls. Figure 2308-23 illustrates the requirements of this section for pipes in a wood-  
framed wall.  
Figure 2308-23 Pipes in walls.

Figure 2308-24 illustrates acceptable cutting or notching of studs.

2308.5.10 Bored holes. Studs often have drilled holes to accommodate wiring, plumbing, etc.  
Figure 2308-25 illustrates acceptable dimensions and location of bored holes in studs.  
Figure 2308-25 Bored holes in studs.  
2308.5.11 Exterior wall sheathing. Exterior wall sheathing other than cement plaster \(stucco\)  
must be sheathed with one of the materials specified in Table 2308.5.11. Type, size, and spacing  
of fasteners must be in accordance with the prescriptive requirements given in Section 2304.10  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand Table 2304.10.2 or the fasteners must designed to resist applicable loads in accordance with  
accepted engineering practice. Other wall sheathing materials and wood structural panels  
installed and fastened in accordance with Section 2304.6 are a permissible alternative.  
2308.6 Wall bracing. All buildings must be able to resist both vertical \(gravity\) loads and lateral  
\(wind and seismic\) loads. Resistance to lateral loads produced by wind pressure or seismic  
ground motion is provided in part by wall bracing. Buildings that do not require a seismic  
analysis in accordance with Section 1613.1 and are located in regions where hurricane winds are  
not anticipated \(see Section 2308.2.4\) should be braced in accordance with this section.  
Conventionally constructed buildings use braced wall panels and braced wall lines to provide  
lateral support for the structure. Braced wall panels in prescriptive design are analogous to shear  
walls in engineered design. A braced wall line consists of a series of straight lines through the  
building plan in both directions \(building length and width\). The difference between a shear wall  
and a braced wall panel is a shear wall is designed and detailed to resist a specific portion of the  
lateral load along a shear wall line, and a braced wall panel is determined from prescriptive rules  
and methods prescribed in the code. Table 2308-3 provides a description of the various wall  
bracing methods.  
Table 2308-3. IBC Braced Wall Panel Methods  
Because IBC wall bracing requirements are in some ways similar to the IRC, a good reference  
and resource for wall bracing in general is Guide to the 2018 IRC Wood Wall Bracing Provisions  
jointly published by APA and ICC.  
2308.6.1 Braced wall lines. Braced wall lines \(BWLs\) consist of a series of braced wall panels  
\(BWPs\) that are considered to be in a line of lateral resistance as shown in Figure 2308.6.1. The  
term is defined in Section 202. For determining the amount and location of bracing required  
along each story level of a building, braced wall lines are considered straight lines in both the  
longitudinal and transverse direction, and placed in accordance with Table 2308.6.1. IBC Figure  
2308.6.1 illustrates the basic components of lateral bracing system consisting of braced wall  
panels and braced wall lines. Braced wall line spacing must be within the limits specified in  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationTable 2308.6.1. In Seismic Design Category D or E, braced wall lines are required to intersect  
and be perpendicular to each other.  
2308.6.2 Braced wall panels. Braced wall panels are the elements that “brace” and provide  
lateral support to the structure. The term is defined in Section 202. As noted, a braced wall line  
consists of a series of complying braced wall panels. To be considered part of a particular braced  
wall line, the braced wall panels cannot be offset from each other by more than 4 feet \(1,219  
mm\). Figure 2308.6.1 illustrates typical layouts for braced wall panels and braced wall lines. A  
braced wall panel must be located at the corners of intersecting braced wall lines and within the  
maximum distance from the end of the braced wall line in accordance with Table 2308.6.1. From  
a plan review perspective, it is important to note that the section requires that braced wall panels  
to be clearly indicated on the plans. A good way to accomplish this is for the designer to provide  
a schematic of each story level, showing the locations of each braced wall line and the braced  
wall panels assumed to be in each line.  
2308.6.3 Braced wall panel methods. Acceptable methods of constructing complying braced  
wall panels are given in Table 2308.6.3\(1\). Each bracing method is given an abbreviated  
designation such as LIB, DWB, and WSP, and each has specific construction requirements. The  
minimum length of braced wall panels depends on the method used. Note that the ABW and  
PFH have maximum specified heights of 10 feet \(3,048 mm\), whereas the other bracing methods  
are governed by the maximum allowable floor-to-floor height or stud height specified in Section  
2308.2.2.  
In regard to braced wall panel heights, it should be noted that the Building Seismic Safety  
Council National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program \(NEHRP\) Recommended Provisions  
for Seismic Regulations for New Buildings and Other Structures considers a structure irregular if  
there are differences of more than 6 feet \(1,829 mm\) in height of the shear panels in a single  
story. Where the heights of a braced wall panel vary significantly, the stiffness and thus the  
distribution of lateral forces will also vary. The usual assumption of a uniform shear per foot will  
not be accurate, and the net result is a possible torsional irregularity. For example, if a structure  
on a hill is supported on 2-foot-high \(610 mm\) braced cripple wall panels on one side and 8-foot-  
high \(2,438 mm\) panels on the other, torsion and redistribution of forces will occur. Although the  
code does not currently require it, an engineered design is recommended to evaluate force  
distribution and provide adequate wall bracing and anchor bolting in this situation. See Section  
2308.6.8.3 for requirements related to variations in cripple wall heights and stepped foundations.  
2308.6.4 Braced wall panel construction. The specific construction requirements for each  
bracing method are given in this section. For example, for panel methods DWB, WSP, SFB,  
PBS, PCP, and HPS, each panel must be at least 48 inches \(1,219 mm\) in length. Minimum panel  
thickness and fastening requirements are provided in Table 2308.6.3\(1\). See section for specific  
details.  
2308.6.5 Alternative bracing. Alternative braced wall panels were developed to solve the  
problem of having narrow walls adjacent to garage door openings. In some cases, alternate  
bracing methods such as ABW or a PFH are permitted to substitute for a 48-inch \(1,219 mm\)  
braced wall panel of Method DWB, WSP, SFB, PBS, PCP, or HPS. Also, Method ABW or PFH  
are permitted to replace the 96-inch \(2,438 mm\) one-faced Method GB or a 48-inch \(1,219 mm\)  
double-faced Method GB.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2308.6.5.1 Alternate braced wall \(ABW\). The braced panel in Section 2308.6.4 may be  
replaced by the ABW of this section. Note that the ABW is a complete assembly; therefore, all  
the requirements described in the section must be met. The specific requirements for constructing  
alternative braced panels are illustrated in Figure 2308-26. Alternative braced wall panels can  
only be used on a one-story building or on the first story of a two-story building. They cannot be  
used on the second story, because the code does not address the specific details and load path  
connections required for in-plane shear transfer and uplift anchorage to resist overturning forces  
at a second-story condition. The minimum length of an ABW is 32 inches \(813 mm\). This allows  
the alternative braced wall panel to fit in tight conditions in comparison to the 48-inch-long  
\(1,219 mm\) braced wall panel.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-26 Alternate braced wall \(ABW\).  
2308.6.5.2 Portal frame with hold-downs \(PFH\). The portal frame with hold-downs \(PFH\)  
allows a reduction of the width of the full-height segment of ABW panels to 16 inches \(406 mm\)  
in width for a one-story building, and 24 inches \(610 mm\) in width for the first story of a two-  
story building. Because it is a prescriptive alternative bracing method, no engineering is required  
if constructed strictly in accordance with all of the requirements of the section, as shown in  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-27.  
Figure 2308-27 Portal frame with hold-downs \(PFH\).  
Method PFH uses the header over the opening to resist lateral forces by running the header  
the length of the sheathed bracing panel to the first full-length stud. Where the sheathing and  
header overlap, the header is fastened to the full-height sheathing with a grid nailing pattern that  
provides some nominal rigidity at the top. At the base of the sheathed section, embedded hold-  
down anchors nailed to the edge studs provide a moment-resistant connection at the base. The  
hold-down anchors are sized to provide uplift and shear resistance capacity, resulting in a  
reduction in anchor bolt requirements at the plate. Additional straps are required as shown in  
Figure 2308-27.  
2308.6.6 Cripple wall bracing. Cripple walls \(sometimes referred to as foundation stud walls or  
knee walls\) are stud walls usually less than 8 feet \(2,438 mm\) in height that rest on the  
foundation sill plate and support the first immediate floor and/or wall above. Where cripple walls  
are exterior walls supporting one or more stories, the wall must be braced with either solid  
blocking or sheathing based on wall bracing requirements. These walls have been found to rack  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationsideways and fail in moderate and large earthquakes. Adding sheathing or blocking stiffens the  
wall.  
For buildings in Seismic Design Categories \(SDC\) A, B, and C, where a cripple wall is part of  
an interior wall line, whether below an interior braced wall line or simply supporting the floor  
above, there is no requirement for bracing the wall line by blocking or sheathing. These walls are  
inside a much stiffer exterior foundation wall of concrete or CMU block and will not move  
independently of the floor and exterior walls during an earthquake.  
Cripple wall bracing in SDC D and E is limited to 14 inches \(356 mm\) in height and must be  
solidly blocked along both interior and exterior walls. Therefore, buildings may only be one-  
story with a slab on grade foundation or a crawlspace consisting of studs 14 inches \(356 mm\) or  
less in height with solid-blocked cripple walls per Table 2308.2.1. Because cripple walls over 14  
inches \(356 mm\) in height are considered an additional story, a one-story building over cripple  
walls is considered a two-story building and prohibited in SDC D and E. The extent of cripple  
wall stud solid blocking to allow for ventilation and access openings is stipulated.  
2308.6.7 Connections of braced wall panels. The general intent of the provisions in this section  
is to provide prescriptive requirements for achieving a continuous load path for lateral loads from  
the roof and floor system to the braced wall lines, braced wall panels, and supporting foundation.  
Section 2308.6.7.1 contains requirements for the bottom plate connections, Section 2308.6.7.2  
contains requirements for the top plate connections, Section 2308.6.7.3 includes sill anchorage  
provisions and 2308.6.7.4 covers anchorage to all-wood foundations. Figures 2308-28 through  
2308-31, which originated with the 1997 NEHRP Commentary \(FEMA 303\), illustrate  
recommended connection details for various framing conditions. Figures 2308-32 through 2308-  
35 illustrate methods of transferring lateral loads from the roof system to braced wall panels.  
These connection details are designed to transfer shears of approximately 100–200 pounds per  
foot \(1.46–2.92 kN/m\), which is consistent with the allowable shear resistance of the prescriptive  
braced wall panel systems.

@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-35 Wall parallel to truss alternate bracing detail.  
The purpose of the connections is to transfer wind and seismic lateral forces. The first  
paragraph of Sections 2308.6.7.1 and 2308.6.7.2 clearly states that the connections apply to  
braced wall lines and not the braced wall panel portion of a braced wall line. For example, the  
connection between blocking and floor framing at a braced wall line top plate does not occur  
only at the braced wall panel, nor does the connection of the wall bottom plate to the foundation  
occur only at the braced wall panel. These connections are required along the entire braced wall  
line.  
2308.6.7.1 Bottom plate connection. The bottom plate must be connected to the supporting  
elements below such as joists, blocking, or the foundation sill plate. The section refers to Table  
2304.10.2, which requires two 16d common nails or equivalent spaced at 16 inches \(406 mm\) on  
center.  
2308.6.7.2 Top plate connection. This section requires braced wall line top plates to be  
connected over their entire length to the framing above and refers to various fastening options in  
Table 2304.10.2. The wording of the second paragraph refers to exterior gable end walls because  
that is the condition where braced wall panels can be practically extended and attached to the  
roof framing. The phrase “braced wall panel sheathing in the top story shall be extended”  
provides a clear description of the requirement. The language “providing equivalent lateral force  
transfer” gives the building official a straightforward basis for accepting methods other than  
blocking between ends of trusses. Required minimum blocking size and connection of blocking  
to the braced wall top plate is specified. Additional guidance on permissible notching or drilling  
through the blocking is located in Section 2308.4.2.4 \(floor joists\) and Section 2308.7.4 \(ceiling  
joists and rafters\). Figures 2308.6.7.2\(1\) and 2308.6.7.2\(2\) illustrate top plate connections where  
engineered trusses are used.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2308.6.7.3 Sill anchorage. Where braced wall lines are required to be supported by continuous  
footings, sills must be anchored to the foundation with ½-inch-diameter \(12.7 mm\) anchor bolts  
with a maximum spacing of 6 feet \(1,829 mm\) on center, or 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) on center for  
structures over two stories in height. Buildings in Seismic Design Category E require ⅝-inch-  
diameter \(15.9 mm\) anchor bolts in accordance with Section 2308.3.1. See Section 2308.6.8 for  
braced wall line support requirements, and discussion under Section 2308.3 for anchorage  
requirements.  
2308.6.7.4 Anchorage to all-wood foundations. This section requires that anchorage to wood  
foundations be designed to have at least as much capacity as is required by Section 2308.3 for  
conventional concrete or masonry foundations.  
2308.6.8 Braced wall line and diaphragm support. The section provides requirements for  
support of braced wall lines as well as roof and floor diaphragms. In general, braced wall lines  
must be supported by continuous footings, except that interior braced wall lines need not be  
supported by continuous footings if the maximum plan dimension of the structure does not  
exceed 50 feet \(15,240 mm\). In this case, continuous footings are required at exterior walls only  
and lateral loads on interior braced wall lines are assumed to be transferred to the exterior  
foundation by the floor system or slab on grade.  
Several types of structural irregularities are not permitted in conventionally constructed wood-  
frame buildings in Seismic Design Category D or E. Figures 2308.4.4.1\(1\), 2308.4.4.1\(2\),  
2308.4.4.2, 2308.6.8.2\(1\), and 2308.6.8.2\(2\) illustrate various conditions to aid the code user in  
understanding several types of structural irregularities. Structures with geometric discontinuities  
in the lateral-force-resisting system sustain more earthquake and wind damage than structures  
without discontinuities. They have also been observed to suffer concentrated damage at the  
discontinuity location. For Seismic Design Category D or E, this section translates applicable  
irregularities from ASCE 7 Tables 12.3-1 and 12.3-2 into limitations on conventional wood-  
frame construction. When a structure has an irregularity and none of the exceptions are met,  
either the entire structure or the nonconventional \(irregular\) portions must be engineered in  
accordance with the engineering provisions of the code. Although conceptually these are equally  
applicable to all seismic design categories, they are most critical in areas of high seismic risk,  
where damage caused by irregularities has repeatedly been observed in past earthquakes.  
Providing an engineered design of the nonconventional portions in lieu of the entire structure is  
explicitly permitted by the code \(see Section 2308.1.1\) and is a common practice in some  
regions. The registered design professional must judge the extent of the portion required to be  
designed. This often involves design of the nonconforming element, adequate force transfer into  
the element, and a complete load path from the element to the foundation. In some cases, the  
nonconforming portion may have enough of an impact on the behavior of a structure to warrant  
that the entire lateral-force-resisting system be engineered.  
2308.6.8.1 Foundation requirements. In Seismic Design Categories D and E, exterior braced  
wall panels are required to be in the same vertical plane as the foundation unless one of the  
exceptions listed in the section are met. If exterior braced wall panels are not in the same vertical  
plane as the foundation and none of the exceptions are met, then that portion of the structure  
containing the offset must be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice as  
prescribed in Section 2308.1.1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationException 1. This limitation applies when braced wall panels are offset out-of-plane from floor  
to floor. In-plane offsets are discussed in Exception 2. Ideally, braced wall panels should always  
stack above each other from floor to floor with the length stepping down at upper floors where  
less length of bracing panel is required. Because cantilevers and setbacks are very often  
incorporated into residential construction, the exception offers rules by which limited cantilevers  
and setbacks can be considered conventional. Exterior braced wall panels are permitted to be  
offset no more than 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) from the plane of the foundation, provided the specific  
requirements given in Items 1.1 through 1.6 are met. Cantilevers or setbacks cannot exceed four  
times the nominal depth of the floor joists. Floor joists are limited to 2 by 10 \[actually 1½ inches  
by 9¼ inches \(38 mm by 235 mm\)\] or larger, spaced 16 inches \(406 mm\) on center and doubled  
at braced wall panel ends to accommodate the vertical overturning reactions at the end of braced  
wall panels. In addition, the ends of the cantilever are attached to a common rim joist to allow for  
redistribution of load. For rim joists that cannot run the entire length of the cantilever, the metal  
tie is intended to transfer vertical shear as well as provide a nominal tension tie. Limitations are  
placed on gravity loads to be carried by the cantilever or setback floor joists so that the joist  
strength will not be exceeded. The roof loads discussed are based on the use of solid-sawn  
members where allowable spans limit the possible loads. Where engineered framing members  
such as trusses are used, gravity load capacity of the cantilevered or setback floor joists should  
be carefully evaluated.  
Exception 2. This limitation applies when braced wall panels are offset in-plane or out-of-plane.  
Ends of braced wall panels supported on window or door headers below can transfer large  
vertical reactions to headers that may not be of adequate size to resist these reactions. The  
exception permits the braced wall panel to extend a maximum of 1 foot \(305 mm\) over an  
opening no more than 8 feet \(2,438 mm\) in width, provided a nominal 4 by 12 or larger header is  
used. The intent is that the vertical reaction will not result in critical shear or flexure. Other  
header conditions that do not meet the exception require an engineered design. Wall segments  
that are not considered braced panels, that is, with minimal lateral resistance, are allowed over  
openings.  
2308.6.8.2 Floor and roof diaphragm support in Seismic Design Categories D and E. This  
limitation applies to open-front structures or portions of structures. The conventional  
construction bracing concept is based on using braced wall lines to divide a structure into a series  
of boxes of limited dimension, with the seismic force to each box being limited by the size. The  
intent is that each box be supported by braced wall lines on all four sides, limiting the amount of  
torsion that can occur. IBC Figure 2308.6.8.2\(1\) illustrates a portion of a roof that is not  
supported by a braced wall line below. The exception, which permits portions of roofs or floors  
to extend up to 6 feet \(1,829 mm\) past the braced wall line, is intended to permit construction  
such as porch roofs and bay windows, as illustrated in IBC Figure 2308.6.8.2\(2\). The framing  
members must be connected to the braced wall line below in accordance with the applicable  
requirements of Section 2308.6.7.  
2308.6.8.3 Stepped footings in Seismic Design Categories B, C, D, and E. IBC Figure  
2308.6.8.3 illustrates the requirements of this section. Where a stepped foundation creates braced  
wall panels that vary in height by more than 4 feet \(1,219 mm\), this section has specific detailing  
requirements. The sill must be anchored to the foundation as required by Section 2308.3. This is  
somewhat redundant because this is a general requirement that applies to all sills anchored to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfoundations. If there is a segment at least 8-foot long \(2,438 mm\) where the floor framing bears  
directly on the sill bolted to the foundation, then the braced wall line is considered sufficiently  
braced, and the double plate of the cripple wall beyond this segment of footing must be spliced to  
the sill plate with metal ties as shown in the figure. Item 2 describes the requirements for the  
splice strap and minimum nailing. Item 3 requires cripple walls to meet the bracing requirements  
for a story, which is essentially the same as is required by Section 2308.6.6.  
2308.6.9 Attachment of sheathing. Wall sheathing must be fastened as specified in Table  
2308.6.1 or the general fastening Table 2304.10.2 without substitution. Adhesives are not  
permitted to be used to fasten wall sheathing due to limited ductility. Nails or staples yield when  
the braced panels are subjected to high seismic demands from earthquake ground motion and the  
panels undergo ductile behavior. Panels attached by adhesives are not permitted because they can  
behave in a brittle manner when subjected to cyclic loading imposed by high seismic demand.  
2308.6.10 Limitations of concrete or masonry veneer. Concrete or masonry veneer must  
comply with Chapter 14 and the requirements of this section.  
2308.6.10.1 Limitations of concrete or masonry veneer in Seismic Design Category B or C.  
In Seismic Design Category B, stone and masonry veneer is permitted to be used in three stories  
above grade if the lowest story is constructed of concrete or masonry walls. Other wall bracing  
must be constructed of wood structural panels with a length that is increased to at least one- and  
one-half times the length required by Table 2308.6.1. Stone and masonry veneer is permitted to  
be used in two stories above grade, provided the lowest story is constructed of concrete or  
masonry walls. Where the lowest story is not constructed of concrete or masonry walls, stone  
and masonry veneer is permitted to be used in two stories above grade, provided the following  
criteria are met\: \(1\) The bracing required by Section 2308.6.1 must be wood structural panels  
with an allowable shear capacity of 350 plf \(16.8 kN/m2\) minimum; \(2\) the bracing of the top  
story must be located at each end, at least every 25 feet \(7,620 mm\) on center and not less than  
25 percent of the braced wall line. The bracing of the first story must be located at each end, at  
least every 25 feet \(7,620 mm\) on center and not less than 45 percent of the braced wall line; \(3\)  
2,000-pound \(8.9 kN\) capacity hold-down devices are required at the ends of braced wall panel  
segments from the second floor to the first floor wall, and 3,900-pound \(17.3 kN\) capacity hold-  
down devices are required from the first floor to the foundation; \(4\) cripple walls are not  
permitted.  
2308.6.10.2 Limitations of concrete or masonry in Seismic Design Categories D and E.  
Concrete or masonry walls and stone or masonry veneer above the foundation \(basement\) level is  
prohibited entirely in Seismic Design Categories D and E. An exception allows stone and  
masonry veneer to be used in the first story above grade in Seismic Design Category D, provided  
the following conditions are met\: \(1\) Wall bracing must be wood structural panels with a  
minimum allowable shear capacity of 350 plf \(16.8 kN/m2\); \(2\) the bracing on the first story  
must be located at each end and at least every 25 feet \(7,620 mm\) on center and not less than 45  
percent of the braced wall line; \(3\) 2,100-pound \(9.3 kN\) capacity hold-down devices are  
required at the ends of braced walls from the first floor to the foundation; \(4\) cripple walls are  
not permitted.  
2308.7 Roof and ceiling framing. These prescriptive roof framing provisions apply only to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationroofs with a minimum slope of 3\:12 or greater. Where roofs have slopes less than 3\:12, the  
horizontal thrust created by truss action with the ridge board and ceiling joists or rafter ties  
becomes excessive. Thus, for roof slopes less than 3\:12, the members supporting the rafters and  
ceiling joists such as the ridge beam, hip, and valley rafters must be designed to resist the gravity  
loads as beams instead of behaving like a truss. See Figures 2308-36 and 2308-37.  
Figure 2308-36 Roof framing.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2308-37 Roof framing thrusts—truss action.  
2308.7.1 Ceiling joist spans. Allowable spans for ceiling joists may be determined in  
accordance with the tables in the code. The tables cover live load of 10 psf \(0.48 kN/m2\) plus  
dead load of 5 psf \(0.24 kN/m2\), live load of 20 psf \(0.96 kN/m2\) plus dead load of 10 psf \(0.48  
kN/m2\), and a deflection limit of L/240. For other grades and species, the section references  
AWC Span Tables for Joists and Rafters \(AWC STJR\).  
2308.7.2 Rafter spans. Allowable spans for roof rafters may be determined in accordance with  
the tables in the code. Rafter spans are measured along the horizontal projection. The tables  
cover live loads of 20 psf \(0.96 kN/m2\) and ground snow loads of 30 and 50 psf \(1.44 and 2.39  
kN/m2\) plus dead loads of 10 and 20 psf \(0.47 and 0.96 kN/m2\). With respect to the indicated  
ground snow loads, the spans shown reflect consideration of unbalanced snow loads in  
accordance with established roof snow load criteria. Other considerations, such as drifting snow  
loads, are not accounted for in these tables. Tabulated rafter spans assume that ceiling joists are  
located at the bottom of the attic space or that some other method of resisting the outward thrust  
of the rafters on the bearing walls, such as rafter ties, is provided at that location. Where ceiling  
joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic space, the rafter spans are multiplied by  
adjustment factors. The deflection limit of L/180 is used for rafters without a ceiling attached to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe rafters. See Table 1604.3 for deflection limits. For other loading conditions, grades and  
species, the section references AWC STJR.  
2308.7.3 Ceiling joist and rafter framing. As noted in the discussion above, the roof rafters in  
conjunction with the ceiling joists or rafter ties form a simple truss. The ceiling joists or rafter  
ties resist the horizontal thrusts, as shown in Figure 2308-38, in tension.  
Figure 2308-38 Ceiling joist and rafter framing.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2308.7.3.1 Ceiling joist and rafter connections. Ceiling joists and rafters must be nailed to each  
other and to the top wall plate in accordance with Tables 2304.10.2 and 2308.7.5. To resist  
outward thrust due to gravity loads, ceiling joists must be tied over interior partitions and  
fastened to adjacent rafters to provide a continuous rafter tie across the building. Where ceiling  
joists are not parallel to rafters, a rafter tie must provide a continuous tie across the building  
spaced not more than 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) on center. Figure 2308-38 illustrates the requirements.  
In either case, the connections must be in accordance with Tables 2308.7.3.1 and 2304.10.2. A  
10d common nail option is included in Table 2308.7.3.1 footnote “a” based on NDS lateral  
design value calculations for nails. The table heading clarifies a 10 pounds per square foot \(0.48  
kN/m2\) dead load basis of the nailing requirements. Also, adjustment factors for rafter tie height,  
consistent with WFCM and IRC, have also been added in footnote “h” to increase connection  
requirements where the rafter tie, or ceiling joist, is not located at the bottom of the attic space.  
Generally, rafter ties located at the top of support walls are also ceiling joists. Ceiling joists are  
required to have a minimum bearing length of not less than 1½ inches \(38 mm\) on the top plate  
at each end.  
2308.7.4 Notches and holes. This section contains prescriptive limits for bored holes and for  
notching at the ends, top or bottom of rafters or ceiling joists.  
2308.7.5 Wind uplift. Wind suction \(main wind force–resisting system pressures\) can cause  
considerable uplift forces on roof framing. The uplift loads must be positively transferred into  
the structure below to resist the uplift. See also Section 2304.10.7 for additional discussion. Note  
that the uplift forces on low slope roofs such as those less than 3\:12 uplift will be larger than the  
forces for roofs with slopes equal to or greater than 3\:12. Since this section only applies to roofs  
with a slope greater than or equal to 3\:12, uplift ties require design for lower-sloped roofs. The  
key features of the table are covered in the footnotes. The uplift loads are in pounds and are  
based on roof truss or rafter spacing of 24 inches \(610 mm\) on center. Other spacings must be  
adjusted. The table values have a built-in allowance for 10-psf \(0.48 kN/m2\) roof dead load. The  
overhang loads are in pounds per foot of projection and based on 24-inch \(610 mm\) spacing. The  
overhang load must be added to the roof uplift load. The uplift loads are based on end zone loads  
from ASCE 7 and allow reductions for connections away from the corners. The uplift loads are  
permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds \(0.44 kN\) based on the dead load for each full-height  
wall above.  
2308.7.6 Framing around openings. This section contains prescriptive requirements for  
trimmer and header rafters used to frame around openings in conventionally framed roofs.  
2308.7.6.1 Openings in roof diaphragms in Seismic Design Categories B, C, D, and E. In  
Seismic Design Categories other than A, openings in roof diaphragms with a dimension greater  
than 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) require metal ties and blocking as shown in Figure 2308.4.4.1\(1\). The  
section prescribes specific requirements for straps, blocking, and nailing to reinforce the  
boundaries of the opening.  
2308.7.7 Purlins. This section contains prescriptive provisions for purlin and strut bracing to  
reduce rafter spans. Purlins and struts are permitted to be installed to reduce the span of rafters to  
be within allowable span limits. Purlins are required to be supported by struts to bearing walls,  
which means a purlin that is braced to an interior wall creates a bearing wall. The maximum span  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationof nominal 2 × 4 purlins is 4 feet \(1,219 mm\), and the maximum span of 2 × 6 purlins is 6 feet  
\(1,829 mm\). However, in no case can the purlin be of smaller size than the supported rafter.  
Struts cannot be less than 2 × 4 members. The maximum unbraced length of struts is 8 feet  
\(2,438 mm\), and the slope of the struts cannot be less than 45 degrees \(0.79 rad\) from the  
horizontal. Figure 2308-39 illustrates purlin and strut requirements.  
Figure 2308-39 Rafter, purlin and strut framing.  
2308.7.8 Blocking. Roof rafters and ceiling joists must be supported laterally to prevent rotation  
and lateral displacement in accordance with Section 2308.4.6, which contains lateral support  
requirements for floor, roof, and ceiling framing. Connections to braced wall lines are prescribed  
in Section 2308.6.7.2.  
2308.7.9 Engineered wood products. Engineered wood products such as wood I-joists, glued-  
laminated timber, and structural composite lumber cannot be notched or drilled except where  
specifically permitted by the product manufacturer or where the effects of notches or drilled  
holes are specifically considered by the registered design professional.  
2308.7.10 Roof sheathing. This section references the appropriate tables for wood structural  
panel and lumber roof sheathing. Wood structural panels should be labeled Exterior or Exposure  
1\. See Sections 2304.6.1 and 2304.8.2. Wood structural panels permanently exposed to outdoor  
conditions should be Exterior type, except that wood structural panels used on the exposed  
underside of roofs or roof overhangs are permitted to be Exposure 1 type. See Section 2303.1.5.  
2308.7.11 Joints. Joints in lumber sheathing must occur over supports unless end-matched  
\(tongue-and-groove\) lumber is used. Where end-matched lumber is used, each individual piece  
must bear on at least two supports.  
2308.7.12 Roof planking. Where 2-inch \(51 mm\) tongue-and-groove wood planking is used, it  
must be installed in accordance with Table 2308.7.12 or be designed in accordance with the  
general engineering provisions of the code.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2308.7.13 Wood trusses. Wood trusses are required to be designed in accordance with the  
engineering provisions of the code and conform to the detailed requirements prescribed in  
Section 2303.4. As noted in the discussion of Section 2303.4.6, pre-engineered metal-plate–  
connected wood trusses are considered structural elements that must be designed in accordance  
with the general engineering provisions of the code and the design, manufacture, and quality  
assurance provisions of TPI 1.  
2308.7.14 Attic ventilation. Refer to the discussion under Section 1203.2 regarding attic  
ventilation.  
2308.8 Design of elements. Where a structure consists of a combination of engineered and  
conventional construction, only those engineered elements must be designed to resist the loads  
and forces specified in Chapter 16. The performance of engineered elements should be  
compatible with the performance of a conventionally framed system. For example, the stiffness  
of the engineered elements should be approximately the same as the stiffness of the conventional  
construction unless a stiffness analysis for proportioning the loads between the conventional and  
engineered construction is performed. The engineering needs only to demonstrate compliance of  
the nonconventional elements with applicable provisions of the code. The code permits elements  
and members as well as rooms or a series of rooms to be engineered in an otherwise  
conventionally constructed building. Thus, many so-called conventional wood-framed buildings  
have elements and portions that are engineered.  
2308.8.1 Elements exceeding limitations of conventional construction. When a  
conventionally constructed building contains structural elements that exceed the limits of Section  
2308.2, those elements and their supporting load path must be designed in accordance with the  
engineering provisions of the code.  
2308.8.2 Structural elements or systems not described herein. When a conventionally  
constructed building contains structural elements or systems that are not specifically covered by  
Section 2308, the elements and their supporting load path must be designed in accordance with  
the engineering provisions of the code. Some examples of such elements are engineered floor  
and roof trusses, I-joists, glued-laminated timber or SCL beams and columns, and cross-  
laminated timber.  
Section 2309 Wood Frame Construction Manual  
2309.1 Wood Frame Construction Manual. The IBC references the ANSI/AWC Wood Frame  
Construction Manual \(WFCM\) for One- and Two-Family Dwellings \(see Figure 2309-1\). The  
ANSI/AWC WFCM is a permissible alternative for structural design of wood-frame dwellings in  
Risk Category I and II subject to the load restrictions in WFCM Section 1.1.2 and the building  
dimension limitations in WFCM Section 1.1.3. For a summary of the limitations, see Table 1 of  
the WFCM. Also see Section 2308 and Tables 2308-1 and 2308-2 for a comparison of IRC, IBC  
Section 2308, and WFCM provisions for conventional light-frame construction.Structures that do  
not comply with the limitations must be designed in accordance with accepted engineering  
practice.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2309-1 The 2018 Wood Frame Construction Manual \(WFCM\) for One- and Two-  
Family Dwellings.  
The WFCM is an ANSI standard developed by American Wood Council \(AWC\) technical  
committees that contains both engineering criteria and engineered prescriptive provisions for  
wood-frame buildings that may be used for the design of wood-frame structures within its scope.  
Although WFCM provisions are intended primarily for detached one- and two-family dwellings  
due to the floor live load assumption associated with those occupancies, many of the provisions  
for specific geographic wind, seismic, and snow loads are applicable to other types of buildings.  
For example, wind provisions for sizing of roof sheathing, wall sheathing, fastening schedules,  
uplift straps, shear anchorage, shear wall lengths, and wall studs for out-of-plane wind loads are  
included in WFCM and are applicable to other occupancies within the load limitations of the  
WFCM tables. Similarly, roof rafter size and spacing for heavy snow, and shear wall lengths and  
anchorage for seismic are applicable within the load limitations of the WFCM tables.

Key Points  
Chapter 24 regulates glass and glazing for essentially two important reasons\:  
1\. To protect against breakage that is due to building distortion under wind and  
earthquake loads along the wall line or perpendicular to the wall and surface of the  
glass.  
2\. To protect against breakage that is due to accidental impact by individuals adjacent to  
the glazing or debris during wind events.  
Glass, light-transmitting ceramic panels, and light-transmitting plastic panels are regulated  
by Chapter 24 for their use in both vertical and sloped applications  
Section 2402 Glazing Replacement  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAn often overlooked provision, replacement windows and other glazing materials must comply  
with the requirements for new installations. The building official must be able to ensure that  
appropriate glazing is used in hazardous locations, in areas where fire-resistant glazing is  
required, and several other scenarios which are outlined in the code. This requirement is also  
highlighted throughout the International Existing Building Code® \(IEBC®\) when performing  
repairs, alterations, changes of occupancy, or when dealing with historic structures.  
Section 2403 General Requirements for Glass  
2403.1 Identification. Because glass is usually incorporated into assemblies that are not  
manufactured at the building site, the code requires that the glass and glazing be identified as to  
type and thickness so that it is possible to determine compliance with this chapter as far as  
permitted areas of glass are concerned. The identifying information furnished on each light may  
be removable or permanent. Where approved by the building official, an affidavit furnished by  
the glazing contractor is acceptable in lieu of the manufacturer’s mark located on each pane of  
glass or glazing material. The affidavit must certify that each light is glazed in accordance with  
approved construction documents, as well as the provisions of Chapter 24. Where an  
identification mark is utilized, it shall designate both the type and the thickness of the material.  
Unless used in a spandrel application, tempered glass is required to be permanently identified  
by the manufacturer. The identifying mark is to be acid etched, sandblasted, ceramic fired,  
embossed, or of any other type that is unable to be removed without being destroyed. A  
removable paper marking provided by the manufacturer is permitted, but only for tempered  
spandrel glass.  
2403.2 Glass supports. Glass firmly supported on all edges is considerably stronger than a glass  
light with one or more free edges. As a result, where the glass does not have firm support on all  
edges, the code requires that a design for the glass be submitted to the building official for  
approval. In this latter case, the design would be based on the number and location of any free  
edges.  
2403.3 Glass framing. The amount of deflection that is permitted to occur within any individual  
pane of glazing is limited, ensuring the safety of the building occupants as well as those in close  
proximity to the building exterior. Section 1604.3.7 notes that the load used to determine the  
glazing deflection shall equal 0.6 times the component and cladding wind loads for the building.  
Section 2403.3 and Section 1604.3.7 each require that any panes of glazing having maximum  
dimensions no more than 13 feet 6 inches \(4,115 mm\) shall not deflect more than the length of  
the pane divided by 175. As an example, consider a 4030 window \[4 feet wide by 3 feet high  
\(1,219 mm by 914 mm\)\]. The maximum pane dimension is 48 inches \(1,219 mm\) and this is to  
be divided by 175, resulting in a maximum allowable deflection of approximately 1/4 inch \(6.4  
mm\)\].  
If the glass panes exceed 13 feet 6 inches \(4,115 mm\), the deflection limit should be measured  
as the maximum pane dimension divided by 240, plus 1/4 inch \(6.4 mm\). Consider a curtain wall  
system having maximum pane dimensions of 10 feet \(3,048 mm\). The first step is to divide 120  
inches \(3,048 mm\) by 240 and then add 1/4 inch \(6.4 mm\). In this scenario a maximum  
deflection of 3/4 inch \(19 mm\) is allowed for a 10-foot \(3,048 mm\) glass pane. The fact that  
these requirements are located in both Chapters 16 and 24 of the code highlight their importance.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2403.5 Louvered windows or jalousies. The requirements for louvered windows are based on  
there being no edge support on the longitudinal edges. See Figure 2403-1. Moreover, for safety  
purposes, the code requires that the exposed edge be smooth. For the same reason, wired glass,  
when used in jalousie or louvered windows, shall have no exposed wire projecting from the  
longitudinal edges. Where a louvered window complies with the provisions of this section, such  
an application is exempt from the requirements for safety glazing for use in hazardous locations.  
Figure 2403-1 Louvered window.  
Section 2404 Wind, Snow, Seismic, and Dead Loads on  
# Glass  
Exterior glass and glazing are subject to the same loads as the exterior cladding of the building;  
therefore, the code requires that glass and glazing in a vertical or near-vertical position should be  
designed for the same wind loads as specified in Section 1609 for components and cladding.  
For seismic considerations, ASCE 7 is referenced for the design of glass in glazed curtain  
walls, glazed storefronts, and glazed partitions. This design will also include the increased  
pressures on local areas at discontinuities. As the slope of the glass increases, it may be  
necessary to address other loads as well, such as the dead load and any snow load. See Figure  
2404-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2404-1 Snow load on glazing.  
Glass sloped 15 degrees \(0.26 rad\) or less from vertical is defined as vertical glass. Glass  
sloped more than 15 degrees \(0.26 rad\) is defined as sloped glass \(see Figure 2405-2\). Table  
2404-1 outlines the applicable code sections for design of various types and orientations of glass.  
Table 2404-1. IBC Design Provisions for Vertical and Sloped Glass  
Section 2405 Sloped Glazing and Skylights  
By application, sloped glazing and skylights consist of glazing installed in roofs or walls that are  
on a slope of more than 15 degrees \(0.26 rad\) from the vertical. See Figures 2405-1 through  
2405-3\. The provisions of the International Building Code® \(IBC®\) are intended to protect these  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationglazed openings from flying fire brands and to provide adequate strength to carry the loads  
normally attributed to roofs. The provisions are also intended to protect the occupants of a  
building from the possibility of falling glazing materials.  
Figure 2405-1 Sloped glazing as roof.  
Figure 2405-2 Sloped glazing.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2405-3 Sloped glazing without screen.  
2405.2 Allowable glazing materials and limitations. Glazing materials and protective measures  
for sloped glazing and skylights are outlined in this section. The materials and their  
characteristics and limitations are as follows\:  
Laminated glass. Laminated glass is usually furnished with an inner layer of polyvinyl butyral,  
which has a minimum thickness of 30 mil \(0.76 mm\). Such glass is highly resistant to impact  
and, as a result, requires no further protection below.  
Wired glass. Wired glass is resistant to impact and, when used as a single-layer glazing, requires  
no additional protection below.  
Tempered glass. Tempered glass is glass that has been specifically heat-treated or chemically  
treated to provide high strength. When broken, the entire piece of glass immediately breaks into  
numerous small granular pieces. Because of its high strength and manner of breakage, tempered  
glass has been considered in the past to be a desirable glazing material for skylights without any  
protective screens. However, as a result of studies that show that tempered glass is subject to  
spontaneous breakage such that large chunks of glass may fall under this condition, the IBC  
requires screen protection below tempered glass unless specifically exempted.  
Approved light-transmitting plastic materials. See discussion under Section 2609.  
Heat-strengthened glass. Heat-strengthened glass is glass that has been reheated to just below  
its melting point and then cooled. This process forms a compression surface on the outer face  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand increases the glass strength. However, heat-strengthened glass has the unsatisfactory  
characteristic of breaking into shards, as does annealed glass. Thus, as a general rule, heat-  
strengthened glass requires screen protection below the skylight to protect the occupants from  
falling shards.  
Annealed glass. Annealed glass is subject to breakage created by impact, has very low strength,  
and is unsatisfactory as a glazing material in skylights and sloped glazing. Annealed glass has a  
further unsatisfactory characteristic for use as a skylight because it breaks up under impact into  
large sharp shards which, when they fall, are hazardous to occupants of a building. Annealed  
glass is permitted to a limited degree as sloped glazing and skylights when no walking surfaces  
are below or when used in some greenhouses, as discussed under Section 2405.3.  
2405.3 Screening. As a general rule, single-layer glazing of heat-strengthened, annealed, wired,  
and fully tempered glass must be provided with broken glass retention screens below the glazing  
material. To ensure that the screen provides the protection necessary, several requirements are  
imposed. The screen shall be of a noncombustible material at least No. 12 B&S gauge \(0.0808  
inch\) mesh with 1 inch by 1 inch \(25 mm × 25 mm\) or smaller openings. The screen must be  
installed within 4 inches \(102 mm\) of the glass surface and capable of supporting twice the  
weight of the glass. In corrosive atmospheres, structurally equivalent noncorrosive screen  
materials must be utilized.  
It is also critical that the screen is installed in a manner that will adequately support the weight  
of the glass. In utilizing a safety factor of 2, the screen and its fastenings must be capable of  
supporting twice the weight of the glazing. In order to accomplish this, the screen is to be  
fastened firmly to the framing members.  
Multiple-layer glazing systems are now used quite often for skylights and sloped glazing  
because of energy-conservation requirements. Where heat-strengthened, fully tempered and  
wired glass is used as the layer facing the interior, screen protection is required below the  
skylight.  
Five exceptions are provided to eliminate the need for protective screens in both monolithic  
and multilayer sloped-glazing systems. The first exception, shown in Figure 2405-3, permits  
fully tempered glass in near vertical wall sections, based on the low height plus the very low  
probability of breakage. Annealed glass may be used only \(and is permitted without screening\)  
under the following two circumstances\:  
1\. Where the accessible area below is permanently protected from falling glass.  
2\. In greenhouses under the limitations outlined in Exception 3.  
The fourth and fifth exception allow use of fully tempered glass and laminated glass as single  
glazing or as both panes in an insulating glass unit within individual dwelling units in Groups R-  
2, R-3, and R-4, provided each pane of the glass is limited to 16 square feet \(1.5 m2\) or less in  
area, and the highest point of the glass is no more than 12 feet \(3,658 mm\) above a walking  
surface or other accessible area. For laminated glass, a 15-mil \(0.38-mm\) polyvinyl butyral inner  
layer is required. Tempered glass must be 3/16 \(4.8 mm\) inch or less in thickness.  
2405.4 Framing. This is an omnibus section containing requirements related to\:  
1\. Combustibility of materials and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. Leakage protection of the skylight juncture with the roof.  
This section logically requires that skylight frames be constructed of noncombustible  
materials where erected on buildings for which the code requires noncombustible roof  
construction—that is, Type I and II construction. Where combustible roof construction is  
permitted by the code, combustible skylight frames are also permitted. Skylights are required to  
be mounted on a curb at least 4 inches \(102 mm\) tall when placed on a roof. See Figure 2405-4.  
Figure 2405-4 Curb for a skylight on a roof.  
The provision requiring a curb at least 4 inches \(102 mm\) above the plane of the roof for  
mounting skylights is intended to provide a means for flashing between the skylight and the  
roofing to prevent leaks around the margin of the skylight. The 4-inch \(102-mm\) curb then  
provides a vertical surface up to which the flashing can be extended and to which the counter-  
flashing may be attached to cover the flashing.  
Section 2406 Safety Glazing  
2406.1 Human impact loads. In areas where it is likely that persons will impact glass or other  
glazing, the IBC mandates that specific glazing materials be installed. Such specific areas, as  
identified in Section 2406.4, are considered by the code as “hazardous locations.  
” Unless  
exempted, all glazing located in hazardous locations must pass the test requirements established  
in Section 2406.2 for impact resistance. Special criteria are placed on plastic glazing, glass block,  
louvered windows, and jalousies.  
2406.2 Impact test. Glazing installed in areas subject to human impact as specifically identified  
by Section 2406.4 is generally required to comply with the CPSC 16 CFR, Part 1201 criteria for  
Category I or II glazing materials as established in Table 2406.2\(1\). CPSC 16 CFR, Part 1201,  
Safety Standard for Architectural Glazing Materials, is a federally mandated safety regulation of  
the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission. The exception also allows the installation of  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationglazing materials that have been tested to a different standard, ANSI Z97.1 Safety Glazing  
Materials Used in Buildings—Safety Performance Specifications and Methods of Test, in limited  
applications. Glazing tested under the ANSI Z97.1 standard must meet the test criteria for Class  
A or B as set forth in Table 2406.2\(2\).  
For the most part, the differences between the CPSC’s 16 CFR Part 1201 standard and the  
ANSI Z97.1 standard relate to their scope and function. The CPSC standard is not only a test  
method and a procedure for determining the safety performance of architectural glazing, but also  
a federal standard that mandates where and when safety glazing materials must be used. It  
preempts any nonidentical state or local code. In contrast, ANSI Z97.1 is only a voluntary safety  
performance specification and test method. It does not indicate where and when safety glazing  
materials must be used.  
Glazing in compliance with the appropriate test criteria of CPSC 16 CFR Part 1201 may be  
used in all hazardous locations. It is also acceptable to utilize safety glazing materials complying  
with ANSI Z97.1, but only to the extent of those applications other than storm doors,  
combination doors, entrance-exit doors, sliding patio doors, and closet doors. In addition, such  
glazing is not permitted in doors and enclosures for hot tubs, whirlpools, saunas, steam rooms,  
bathtubs, and showers. In all other areas subject to human impact \(hazardous locations\) as  
specified in Section 2406.4, required safety glazing is permitted to comply with the applicable  
requirements of either CPSC 16 CFR 1201 or ANSI Z97.1. See Figure 2406-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2406-1 Safety glazing classification.  
Where glazing that is tested in accordance with CPSC 16 CFR Part 1201 is utilized, the base  
requirement is that Category II glazing be used. Only where permitted by Table 2406.2\(1\) is the  
use of Category I glazing permitted. A similar approach is provided for those locations where  
glazing complying with the ANSI Z97.1 criteria can be applied. \[See the discussion of Tables  
2406.2\(1\) and 2406.2\(2\) for information on glazing categories.\] As an example, glazing adjacent  
to stairs as regulated by Section 2406.4.6 is not addressed in Table 2406.2\(1\). Therefore, glazing  
tested in accordance with CPSC 16 CFR 1201 must meet the test criteria for Category II. If  
tested in accordance with ANSI Z97.1, Category A glazing is required. Where Tables 2406.2\(1\)  
and 2406.2\(2\) are applicable, such as for glazed panels adjacent to doors as regulated by Section  
2406.4.2, the minimum required category classification is provided based on the size of the glass  
lite.  
Table 2406.2\(1\)—Minimum Category Classification of Glazing Using CPSC 16 CFR 1201.  
Glazing tested in accordance with CPSC 16 CFR 1201 is classified as either Category I or II,  
based on the specifics of the test. The Category II classification is more difficult to achieve and is  
thus required in those areas where the highest degree of protection is required. Although  
Category II material is acceptable in all hazardous locations, Category I glazing may only be  
installed as relatively small lites in doors and areas adjacent to doors. Otherwise, only Category  
II glazing is acceptable. See Figure 2406-2. As addressed in the discussion of Section 2406.2,  
Category II glazing is required in those hazardous locations not addressed in Table 2406.2\(1\).  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2406-2 Hazardous locations.  
Table 2406.2\(2\)—Minimum Category Classification of Glazing Using ANSI Z97.1. The  
minimum required category classification of glazing tested to ANSI Z97.1, established in Table  
2406.2\(2\), is also based on the glazing location and size of the lite. This approach is similar to  
that for determining the minimum required category classification of glazing tested to CPSC 16  
CFR 1201 as set forth in Table 2406.2\(1\). ANSI Z97.1 addresses three separate impact  
categories or classes, based on impact performance. ANSI Z97.1 Class A glazing materials are  
comparable to the CSCS Category II glazing materials and ANSI Z97.1 Class B glazing  
materials are comparable to the CPSC Category I glazing materials. For those hazardous  
locations not addressed in Table 2406.2\(2\), the use of Category A glazing is required. Although  
there is also a Class C category recognized by ANSI Z97.1, applicable only for fire-resistant  
glazing materials, it is not viewed by the code as an acceptable safety glazing material. Only  
Class A and B ANSI Z97.1 glazing materials are recognized in the table.  
2406.3 Identification of safety glazing. The code requires the identification of safety glazing for  
the same reasons as for ordinary annealed glass not subject to human impact. However, in the  
case of safety glazing, the requirement carries more detail insofar as improperly installed  
annealed glass in areas of human impact can create a serious hazard. Therefore, it is doubly  
important that the glazing material be further identified to ensure that the proper glazing material  
is in place. Not only does proper marking assist in the inspection process, it could also help  
identify a location where safety glazing must be installed should future replacement be required.  
The code specifically requires the use of identification marks for glazing installed in hazardous  
locations.  
Each pane of safety glazing must be individually identified with a manufacturer’s designation.  
It shall specify who applied the designation, the manufacturer or the installer, and the safety  
glazing standard with which the glazing complies, as well as the type and thickness of the glass  
or glazing material. Acceptable methods for the designation include acid etching, sand blasting,  
ceramic firing, and embossing. Additionally, the designation is permitted to be of a type that  
cannot be removed without being destroyed. This limitation ensures that a designation cannot be  
transferred to any other glazing materials. As another option, the building official may be willing  
to accept a certification or affidavit from the supplier and/or installer indicating that the  
appropriate glazing was provided and installed. Under such a situation, it is critical that the  
building official be completely satisfied that the appropriate material is utilized for the  
installation location. The acceptance of an affidavit or similar document is appropriate for all  
safety glazing materials other than tempered glass.  
The only variation to the general requirement for individual identification is for multipane  
glazed assemblies such as French doors. Where the individual panes do not exceed 1 square foot  
\(0.0929 m2\) in exposed area, only one pane in the assembly is required to be marked as  
described above. However, all other panes in the assembly must still be identified with “CPSC  
16 CFR, Part 1201.  
” See Figure 2406-3. Where multiple panes occur in assemblies other than  
doors or enclosures regulated by Item 5 of Section 2406.4, glazing tested and labeled as “ANSI  
Z97.1” is also acceptable.

2406.4 Hazardous locations. This section lists those specific hazardous locations where safety  
glazing is required. Some of these locations are shown in Figures 2406-5 through 2406-14. In  
addition to the hazardous locations shown in the various illustrations, safety glazing is also  
required for a number of other conditions, including fixed and sliding panels of sliding door  
assemblies, storm doors, and glass railings.

Figure 2406-14 \(b\) Glazing adjacent to bottom stair landing.  
Figure 2406-2 also illustrates several locations where safety glazing may or may not be  
required. To facilitate discussion, each panel has been numbered. Panels 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 are  
addressed under Section 2406.4.3. Under this provision, all four stated conditions must occur  
before safety glazing is required. These conditions are as follows\:  
1\. The area of an individual pane must be greater than 9 square feet \(0.84 m2\);  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2\. 3. 4. The bottom edge must be less than 18 inches \(457 mm\) above the floor;  
The top edge must be more than 36 inches \(914 mm\) above the floor; and  
One or more walking surfaces must be within 36 inches \(914 mm\), measured  
horizontally, of the glazed panel.  
Panel 1 is not required to have safety glazing, because a protective bar has been installed in  
compliance with Exception 2 to Section 2406.4.3, the requirements of which are illustrated in  
Figure 2406-4. Panels 2 and 3 do not require safety glazing, because their bottom edges are not  
less than 18 inches \(457 mm\) from the floor. If Panels 8 and 9 have a walking surface within 36  
inches \(914 mm\) of the interior, safety glazing would be required. This would be true even  
though the bottom of the panel appears to be greater than 18 inches \(457 mm\) above the exterior  
walking surface, as the exterior condition would have no bearing on the determination. However,  
the exterior condition, because it is adjacent to a stairway, would be regulated by Section  
2406.4.6 and/or Section 2406.4.7 for glazing adjacent to stairways. Therefore, multiple  
conditions mandate the need for safety glazing in Panels 8 and 9. Panels 4 and 7 require safety  
glazing because they are door sidelights. The exception using a horizontal rail mentioned above  
does not apply to panels adjacent to a door; therefore, although Panel 7 has been provided with a  
protective bar, safety glazing is still required.  
Panels 5 and 6 in Figure 2406-2 are glass doors, which require safety glazing based on the  
provisions of Section 2406.4.1. All ingress and egress doors, unframed swinging doors, and  
glazing in storm doors require safety glazing, as well as any other swinging, sliding, and bifold  
doors with fixed or operable glazed panels. See Figure 2406-5. There are several exceptions. If  
openings in a door will not allow passage of a 3-inch-diameter \(76-mm\) sphere, the glazing is  
exempt, as are assemblies of leaded, faceted, or carved glass used for decorative purposes. The  
latter exception not only applies to doors, but also to sidelights and other glazed panels covered  
by Sections 2406.4.2 and 2406.4.3.  
Figure 2406-8, safety glazing would not be required. If the door serves only a shallow storage  
room or closet, adjacent glazing need not be safety glazing, as depicted in Figure 2406-9. Figure  
2406-10 illustrates an exception applicable only to one- and two-family dwellings and within  
dwelling units in Group R-2 uses.  
Figure 2406-11 illustrates the condition where a window occurs within a tub/shower  
enclosure. If glazing in the window shown is less than 60 inches \(1,524 mm\) above a standing  
surface, then safety glazing would be required. This same requirement applies not only to  
tub/shower combinations, but also to windows installed adjacent to hot tubs, whirlpools, saunas,  
steam rooms, showers, and bathtubs. Because of the presence of moisture, all of these locations  
represent slip hazards and need safety glazing to prevent injury in case of a fall. The provisions  
of Section 2406.4.5 address not only glazing adjacent to bathtubs, showers, hot tubs, and  
whirlpools, but also any glazing adjacent to indoor and outdoor swimming pools, as shown in  
Figure 2406-12.  
Glass in railings, baluster panels, and in-fill panels, regardless of height above the walking  
surface, require safety glazing. Because of the high probability that persons will impact guards, it  
is critical that an increased level of protection be provided.  
Section 2406.4.6 requires the installation of safety glazing for glazing adjacent to stairways,  
landings, and ramps. Where the glazing is within 36 inches \(914 mm\) horizontally and 60 inches  
\(1,524 mm\) vertically of the adjacent walking surface, safety glazing is mandated. See Figure  
2406-13\. In addition, Section 2406.4.7 identifies a hazardous location to be within 5 feet \(1,524  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmm\) of the bottom tread of a stairway when the bottom edge of the glazing is less than 60 inches  
\(1,524 mm\) above the landing. See Figure 2406-14. Where protected by a railing or guard  
located at least 18 inches \(457 mm\) from the glass, safety glazing is not required.  
2406.5 Fire department access panels. There may be conditions under which glass panels will  
be utilized for fire department access purposes. Certainly, such panels shall be of the type that  
will provide safe conditions under which fire department personnel can enter a building or a  
specific area of a building. For this reason, glass access panels must be of tempered glass. Where  
the glazed unit is an insulating panel, all panes shall be tempered. Because access must be  
provided completely through the panel, it is necessary that all panes be of this specific safety  
glazing material.  
Section 2407 Glass in Handrails and Guards  
The desired use of glass in handrail assemblies and guard sections prompted the inclusion of  
these provisions in the IBC. See Figure 2407-1. These provisions provide uniform regulations  
identifying the specific types of safety glazing that may be used structurally. Laminated  
tempered and laminated heat-strengthened glass are the only types considered by the code to be  
structurally adequate under all conditions of installation. Single tempered glass that is not a  
laminated product is acceptable under limited applications where there is no walking surface  
below the glass, or where the walking surface below is permanently protected from the risk of  
falling glass.  
Figure 2407-1 Glass balusters with handrail.  
Only glazing conforming to the provisions of Section 2406.1.1 is permitted. This would limit  
glazing in a handrail or guard to materials that have passed the applicable test requirements of  
CPSC 16 CFR 1201 or ANSI Z97.1. Regardless of the type of glazing, the minimum nominal  
thickness of the structural balustrade panels in railings shall be ¼ inch \(6.4 mm\). Glass handrails  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationand guards and their supporting system must be designed to withstand the loads as specified in  
Section 1607.9, utilizing a safety factor of 4. Guards having glass balusters are not permitted to  
be installed without an attached top rail or handrail supported by at least three structural glass  
balusters. The purpose for requiring at least three balusters is that, should one fail, the remaining  
two balusters will continue to support the handrail or guard section. As an alternative to having  
three balusters supporting the handrail, the code allows the design team to provide a means of  
ensuring the handrail will remain in place should a glass baluster fail.  
Section 2408 Glazing in Athletic Facilities  
Where glazing forms entire or partial wall sections, or is used as a door or as part of a door, in  
racquetball courts, squash courts, gymnasiums, basketball courts, and similar athletic facilities  
subject to impact loading, it shall comply with Section 2408. In racquetball and squash courts,  
glass walls and glass doors must pass specific test criteria above and beyond those typically  
required of safety glazing materials. Such special test criteria are necessary to address those  
glazed areas where impact with the glass is not merely accidental, but rather expected because of  
the nature of the physical activities involved. Special conditions for compliance are also set forth  
for glazing subject to human impact in gymnasiums, basketball courts, and other high-intensity  
activity areas where it is expected that contact with the glazing will occur more often, and with  
more force, than in most hazardous locations addressed by the code. In such facilities, all glazing  
in hazardous locations identified by the code must meet the Category II requirement of CPSC 16  
CFR 1201 or the Class A requirements of ANSI Z97.1. This would include glazing both in doors  
\(only CPSC 16 CFR 1201 glazing permitted\) and adjacent to doors.  
Section 2409 Glass in Walkways, Elevator Hoistways, and  
# Elevator Cars  
Section 2409 deals with three separate building elements, as noted in the title. First, it addresses  
requirements for elevated glass walkways, mandating that glazing in such walkways consist of  
laminated glass which complies with ASTM E2751. This ASTM standard addresses design and  
support requirements for elevated glass walkways. Section 2409.1 also mandates that the glazing  
meet the fire-resistance-rating requirements for the applicable floor/ceiling assembly.  
Glass within elevator hoistways must comply with the hazardous location requirements in  
addition to meeting the fire-resistance rating established in Section 716 for hoistways. Provisions  
are also provided for glass used in hoistway doors. Glass used within elevator cars must consist  
of laminated glass conforming to Class A of ANSI Z97.1 or Category II of CPSC 16 CFR Part  
1201\. This includes all glazing within the car, such as doors, walls, ceilings, and lining materials.  
An exception permits the use of tempered glazing under specified conditions.

This chapter regulates covering materials for walls and ceilings with requirements for\:  
1\. 2. Providing weather protection for the exterior of the building.  
Securing the material to the wall and ceiling framing to remain in place during the  
expected life of the building.  
Where these materials are used or required for fire-resistance-rated construction, the code  
requires that they also comply with the provisions of Chapter 7  
Section 2501 General  
This chapter of the International Building Code® \(IBC®\) covers the material, design,  
construction, and quality requirements for wall- and ceiling-covering materials, including their  
method of fastening and, in the case of plaster, the permitted materials for lath, plaster, and  
aggregate.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationAlthough plaster has many uses, including ornamental and decorative work, its use in the IBC  
is regulated purely as a wall- and ceiling-covering material.  
The IBC regulates the installation of wall- and ceiling-covering materials as well as quality  
standards for the materials themselves. The primary wall- and ceiling-covering material in use  
today is gypsum wallboard; however, other gypsum panel products, as well as lath, plaster, and  
wood paneling, are sometimes utilized. As wood paneling is covered in Chapter 23, it follows  
that Chapter 25 only regulates gypsum wallboard, gypsum panel products, lath, and plaster.  
However, in this section the code permits the installation of other wall- and ceiling-covering  
materials, provided the materials have been approved. On this basis, the manufacturer’s  
recommendations and conditions of approval should be consulted.  
Gypsum wallboard is a relatively new material for covering walls and ceilings. On the other  
hand, plaster is among the oldest of building materials still in use. The use of gypsum plaster  
dates back to about 4,000 B.C., when the Egyptians applied it to the interior and exterior of the  
pyramids.  
A key aspect of regulation of the use of gypsum board, gypsum panel products, and plaster  
relates to where such materials are installed. Surfaces of walls, ceilings, floors, roofs, soffits, and  
similar elements, where exposed to the weather, are typically considered weather-exposed  
surfaces or exterior surfaces. There are three exceptions defined in Section 202 to the general  
criteria that define weather-exposed surfaces. Exterior conditions considered other than weather-  
exposed surfaces are illustrated in Figure 2501-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2501-1 Weather-exposed surfaces.  
Section 2508 Gypsum Construction  
This section addresses the installation of gypsum materials; primarily that of gypsum wallboard  
installed as wall and ceiling membranes. As gypsum board is a construction material utilized in  
almost every construction project, it is important that its application is in compliance with the  
IBC and the appropriate referenced standards.  
2508.1 General. The primary installation criteria for various gypsum materials are in referenced  
standards identified in Table 2508.1. The application of gypsum board varies based on gypsum  
board thickness, wall or ceiling installation, orientation of gypsum board to the framing  
members, and maximum spacing of the framing members. Based on the specific conditions  
encountered, the maximum fastener spacing and size of fasteners are identified.  
2508.2 Limitations. Because gypsum plaster and gypsum board are subject to deterioration from  
moisture, the code restricts their use to interior locations and weather-protected surfaces. The  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdefinition for weather-exposed surfaces is found in Section 202 and illustrated in Figure 2501-1.  
Even where installed in interior locations, it is important that gypsum wallboard not be installed  
in areas of continuous high humidity or wet locations. The IBC further requires that interior  
gypsum board, gypsum plaster, and gypsum lath shall not be installed until the installation has  
been weather-protected.  
2508.3 Single-ply application. The application of gypsum wallboard is specified in this chapter  
for locations where fire-resistance-rated construction is not provided or for construction where  
shear resistance or diaphragm action is not required. Table 2508.1 provides the installation  
standards for various types of gypsum construction.  
The code requires that the fit of gypsum wallboard sheets be such that the edges and ends are  
in moderate contact. However, wider gaps are permitted in concealed spaces where fire-  
resistance-rated construction or diaphragm action is not required. This requirement is based  
primarily on appearance. Therefore, where the wallboard application is concealed, it is not  
objectionable to have wider gaps than those resulting from moderate contact. However, where  
the wallboard surface is exposed as it normally is, moderate contact is required so that there will  
be no objectionable cracking when the joint between the sheets is finished.  
Unless the wallboard is considered a shear-resisting element or an element of a fire-  
resistance-rated assembly, fasteners may be omitted at certain locations. It should be emphasized  
that where a fire-test report or other installation standard indicates that fasteners are required on  
supports or edges, the fastening pattern may not be modified. Otherwise, those fasteners located  
at the top and bottom plates of vertical assemblies are permitted to be omitted. In addition,  
fasteners need not be provided at the edges and ends of horizontal assemblies perpendicular to  
supports and at the wall line. Note that fasteners are to be applied in a manner in which the face  
paper is not fractured by the fastener head. The intent of the requirement is to provide a tight  
fastening but not damage the gypsum board to the extent its nail-holding power may be affected.  
Proper construction procedure for the nailing of gypsum wallboard panels is to use a drywall  
hammer that has a crowned head and use wallboard nails that have concave heads. The intent is  
to create a dimple in the wallboard with no projection of the nail head above the wallboard.  
2508.5 Joint treatment. Although as a general rule the IBC requires joint and fastener treatment  
for fire-resistance-rated assemblies, the code exempts locations where the wallboard is to receive  
a decorative finish or any other similar application, which is considered to be equivalent to the  
joint treatment. Also, joint treatment is not required where joints occur over wood framing  
members, or where square-edge or tongue-and-groove edge gypsum board is used. In addition,  
joint treatment is not required for assemblies tested without joint treatment. In general, joint  
treatment does not materially increase the fire rating, and many partitions have passed the fire  
test without joint treatment. As indicated earlier in this section, joint treatment is primarily used  
for aesthetic reasons. One further exception addresses the condition where a multilayer system is  
constructed. Where two or more layers of gypsum board are utilized in the assembly, joint and  
fastener treatment is not required where the joints of adjacent layers are offset from each other.  
Section 2510 Lathing and Furring for Cement Plaster  
# \(Stucco\)  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationCement plaster \(stucco\) used in both exterior and interior locations must be installed in  
accordance with this section. In order to ensure reliability and consistency, the materials of  
construction must comply with the appropriate standards listed in Table 2507.2. Of particular  
importance is the installation method of the water-resistive barrier \(WRB\) that is required over  
wood-based sheathing where exterior plaster is applied. Section 1403.2 outlines the requirements  
for WRB’s and notes that they shall be continuous and describes acceptable products that can be  
used.  
WRB provisions in Section 2510 are divided into two categories\: WRB requirements for  
plaster in “dry climates,  
” and provisions for “moist or marine climates.  
” In both scenarios two  
options are provided. For dry climates, Option \#1 is to use two layers of 10-minute Grade D  
paper. Grade D paper is classified as a Type I WRB in accordance with ASTM E2556. The  
greatest benefits of using two layers of WRB materials can only be realized if the method and  
manner of the installation establish a continuous drainage plane, separated from the stucco. In a  
two-layer system, each layer provides a separate and distinct function. The primary function of  
the inboard layer is to resist water penetration into the building cavity. This interior layer should  
be integrated with window and door flashings, the weep screed at the bottom of the wall, and any  
through-wall flashings or expansion joints. This inner layer becomes the drainage plane for any  
incidental water that gets through the outer layer or at one of the joints or openings or where the  
outer layer is damaged. The primary function of the outboard layer \(layer that comes in contact  
with the stucco\) is to separate the stucco from the WRB. This layer has historically been called a  
sacrificial layer, intervening layer, or bond break layer. See Figure 2510-1. The second option for  
“dry climates” is to apply a single layer of 60-minute Grade D paper. This is considered a Type  
II WRB in accordance with ASTM E2556 and must be separate from the stucco by foam plastic  
sheathing, a non-absorbing layer, or a drainage space.  
Figure 2510-1 Installation of water-resistive barrier.  
The options available for “moist or marine climates” incorporate the two options for “dry  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationclimates” with some additional provisions. For Option \#1 the user can follow either Option \#1 or  
\#2 for “dry climates” so long as a space or drainage material having a depth of at least 3/16 inch  
is provided on the exterior side of the WRB. Option \#2 requires that option \#2 for “dry climates”  
be following in addition to confirming that the drainage efficiency on the exterior side of the  
WRB can be measured at a minimum of 90 percent. Obviously, in wet climates it becomes  
imperative that adequate drainage at the exterior side of the WRB is provided to afford an  
additional safety factor to limit moisture from entering the wall cavity.  
Section 2511 Interior Plaster  
Multicoat plastering has been the standard in the western world for over 100 years. It is generally  
the consensus of the industry that, particularly where plaster application is by hand, multicoat  
work is necessary for control of plaster thickness and density. Most of the materials used for  
plaster densify underhand application because of the pressure applied to the trowels, and it is  
believed that this change in density is more controllable and will be of a more uniform nature  
where the plaster is applied in thin, successive layers. For these reasons, the IBC requires three-  
coat plastering over metal or wire lath and two-coat work applied over other plaster bases  
approved for use by the code. Reducing the requirement for plaster bases other than metal or  
wire lath is based on the rigidity of the plaster base itself. More rigid plaster bases are not as  
susceptible to variations in thickness and flatness of the surface. In fact, it may be considered that  
the first coat applied in three-coat work on a flexible base, such as wire lath, is used to stiffen  
that base to provide the rigidity necessary to attain uniform thickness and surface flatness.  
Fiber insulation board does not have the qualities necessary for a good performing plaster  
base. It absorbs excessive moisture from the plaster mix, creating problems of workmanship, and  
it does not have the stability and rigidity required for a proper functioning plaster base. Also, in  
the colder and damper climates, the fiberboard insulation retains the moisture absorbed from the  
plaster for a relatively longer period of time than other bases, causing premature failure of the  
plaster. For these reasons, the code prohibits its use as a plaster base.  
Because cement plaster does not bond properly to gypsum plaster bases, the code prohibits its  
use over gypsum plaster bases. However, the code permits exterior plaster to be applied on  
horizontal surfaces, soffits, and so on, over gypsum lath and gypsum board when used as a  
backing for metal lath.  
Plaster grounds are utilized to establish the thickness of plaster and usually are wood or metal  
strips attached to the plaster base. The intent is that plaster grounds are used as a guide for the  
straightedge in determining the thickness. In many cases, door and window frames are used as  
plaster grounds.  
In plaster work, a base coat is any coat beneath the finish coat. This is true whether the plaster  
is of two-coat or three-coat application. In three-coat work, the first coat is usually referred to in  
the trade as the scratch coat. It is usually applied over flexible bases, such as metal or wire fabric  
lath, and is intended to stiffen the base and provide a mechanical bond to the base. Also, as its  
name implies, the first coat is scratched with a scarifying tool, which provides horizontal ridges  
or scratches that are intended to provide mechanical keys for the application of the second coat  
\(or brown coat\). The brown coat usually constitutes the major bulk of the plaster and,  
consequently, materially affects the membrane strength. As a result, proportioning and  
workability are critical, and the mix should have high plasticity for proper application. The term  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbrown coat is utilized by the trade to differentiate the relative color of the second coat to the  
finish coat, which is usually much lighter in color and is sometimes white, depending on the  
constituents.  
The base coats in plaster work provide the strength for the plaster membrane but generally do  
not provide a proper surface texture for a finished surface. Therefore, a thin, almost veneer, coat  
of plaster is applied to the base coats as a finish coat. The finish coat may be applied in such a  
manner as to provide an ornamental or decorative finish, or it may be applied as a smooth surface  
to act as a flat base over which paint and wallpaper may be applied.  
Section 2512 Exterior Plaster  
Cement plaster is the only material approved by the code for exterior plaster. Gypsum plaster  
deteriorates under conditions of weather and moisture, which are prevalent on the exterior  
surfaces of buildings. Exterior cement plaster is required by the code to be applied in not less  
than three coats when applied over metal lath, wire-fabric lath, or gypsum board backing for the  
same reasons as discussed for interior plaster. When the cement plaster is applied over other  
approved plaster bases, the code requires only two-coat work. Additionally, where the plaster  
surface is to be completely concealed; it is not necessary to provide a finish coat.  
The code requires that the exterior plaster be installed to completely cover, but not extend  
below, the lath and paper on wood or metal-studded exterior wall construction supported by an  
on-grade concrete floor slab. This requirement, combined with the requirement in Section  
2512.1.2 for a weep screed, is intended to prevent the entrapment of free moisture and the  
subsequent channeling of the moisture to the interior of the building. See Figure 2512-1.  
Figure 2512-1 Exterior stucco construction—wall with wire mesh, paper, and scratch coat.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2512.1.2 Weep screeds. Water can penetrate exterior plaster walls for a variety of reasons. Once  
it penetrates the plaster, the water will run down the exterior face of the water-resistive barrier  
until it reaches the sill plate or mudsill. At this point, the water will seek exit from the wall, and  
if the exterior plaster is not applied to allow the water to escape, it will exit through the inside of  
the wall and leak into the building. Thus, the IBC requires a weep screed that, when constructed  
as shown in Figure 2512-2, will permit the escape of the water to the exterior of the building. In  
addition, where weep screeds are not provided for plaster exterior walls constructed in cold-  
climate areas, it is possible that the trapped moisture will freeze and cause a premature failure of  
the exterior plaster. The water-resistive barrier required by the code must lap the weep screed’s  
vertical flange. Although this section does not specify the amount of overlap, at least 2 inches  
\(51 mm\) should be adequate in keeping with the typical weather-resistive-barrier lap  
requirements.  
Figure 2512-2 Weep screed.  
2512.2 Plasticity agents. Admixtures such as plasticizers should not be added to Portland  
cement or blended cement unless approved by the building official. Some admixtures can have  
deleterious effects that more than offset the desired improvement in plasticity. It is preferable  
that plasticizers be added during the manufacture of the cement in order to ensure product  
uniformity and proper proportions. When plastic cement is used, the code does not permit any  
further additions of plasticizers as it is assumed that the amount added during the manufacturing  
process is adequate and is the maximum permitted. Hydrated lime and lime putty are time-tested  
plasticizers used with cement plaster, and their use is permitted by the code in the amounts set  
forth in ASTM C 926.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2512.4 Cement plaster. When cement plaster is applied during freezing weather, it loses a high  
proportion of its strength and, therefore, does not meet the intent of the code. In addition to  
protecting the plaster coats from freezing for at least 24 hours after set has occurred, application  
of the plaster should only be done when the ambient temperature is higher than 40°F \(4°C\).  
Plaster may be applied in colder temperatures where provisions are made to keep the cement  
plaster work above 40°F \(4°C\) during application and for at least 48 hours thereafter.  
It is also important that the plaster not be applied to frozen bases or those covered with frost,  
which will not only weaken the bond of the plaster to its base but will also freeze the layer of  
plaster adjacent to the frozen base. In those cases where cement plaster is mixed with frozen  
ingredients or applied to a frozen base, it loses a high percentage of its strength.  
KEY POINTS  
• Limits on provisions for wall and ceiling coverings are detailed for weather-exposed  
surfaces.  
• Because gypsum plaster, gypsum lath, gypsum panel products, and gypsum board are  
subject to deterioration from moisture, the code limits their use to interior locations and  
weather-protected surfaces.  
• For exterior plaster walls, the IBC requires a weep screed that will permit the escape of  
water to the exterior of the building.

Key Points  
This chapter covers the use and installation of various types of plastic materials. Included are  
foam plastic insulation, light-transmitting plastics, plastic veneer, plastic composites, and  
interior plastic trim  
Section 2603 Foam Plastic Insulation  
Foam plastic insulation code provisions developed as a result of extensive research are centered  
on two basic concepts\:  
1\. An index limitation of the flame spread and smoke developed to 75 and 450,  
respectively.  
2\. Separation of the foam plastic insulation from the interior of the building by an  
approved thermal barrier. The adequacy of the thermal barrier is related to the time  
during which the thermal barrier is expected to remain in place under fire conditions.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation2603.1.1 Spray-applied foam plastic. Reference is made to ICC 1100 for single- or multi-  
component spray-applied foam plastic insulation. ICC 1100 is the industry standard for spray-  
applied foam plastics and establishes minimum physical properties and performance  
requirements for spray-applied products. The standard also addresses specific installation  
requirements.  
2603.2 Labeling and identification. In addition to the flame-spread and smoke-developed  
criteria, the code also requires that the containers of foam plastic and foam plastic ingredients be  
labeled by an approved agency to show that the material is compliant. There are many foam  
plastic products on the market that do not comply with the code and that were not intended for  
use in construction. The labeling requirement is intended to prevent the misapplication of  
products not designed for this use.  
2603.3 Surface-burning characteristics. It is important that any foam plastic insulation or foam  
plastic core material found in manufactured assemblies be limited in flame spread and smoke  
development. In this section, the code limits such foam plastic materials to a flame-spread index  
of 75 and a smoke-developed index of 450 where tested at the maximum intended thickness of  
use. Various exceptions are provided for interior trim, cold-storage buildings and similar  
facilities, interior signs in covered mall buildings, listed roof assemblies, and special approvals.  
2603.4 Thermal barrier. Because of the potential hazards involved, foam plastic must typically  
be separated from the interior of a building by an approved thermal barrier. Gypsum wallboard at  
least ½ inch \(12.7 mm\) in thickness satisfies this requirement, as does any equivalent thermal  
barrier material complying with the criteria of this section. It must be demonstrated by approved  
testing that the thermal barrier will remain in place for the required 15-minute time period.  
The thermal barrier as described is not required when the conditions described in Sections  
2603.4.1.1 through 2603.1.14 are met; however, some form of protective membrane is typically  
mandated.  
Masonry or concrete construction. When foam plastics are encapsulated within concrete or  
masonry walls, or floor or roof systems, the code does not require a thermal barrier as long as the  
foam plastic is covered by a minimum 1-inch \(25-mm\) thickness of the masonry or concrete. See  
Figure 2603-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2603-1 Encapsulated foam plastic.  
Cooler and freezer walls. Cold storage uses provide a unique condition for foam plastic  
insulation in that thicknesses are generally required to be greater than 4 inches \(102 mm\) for  
proper thermal insulation, although 4 inches \(102 mm\) is about the maximum that can be tested.  
The code, in all other cases, places limits on the thickness of the foam plastic insulation to that  
which was tested. However, because of the nature of the use in cold-storage facilities, the  
ignition hazards are not great. Therefore, the code permits foam plastic insulation in greater  
thicknesses, up to a maximum of 10 inches \(250 mm\), even though tested at a thickness of 4  
inches \(102 mm\). The intent is that the foam plastic will be provided with a complying protective  
thermal barrier. In the case of interior rooms within a building, the foam plastic is required to be  
protected on both sides with a complying thermal barrier.  
Provisions are included to permit cooler and freezer walls without a thermal barrier if multiple  
conditions are met. Again, the code presumes that with a low-hazard use, such as a cold storage  
and freezer box, the metal covering will prevent the actual impingement of any flames on the  
foam plastic, and the sprinkler system will provide the cooling necessary to maintain proper low  
temperatures to prevent ignition of the foam plastic.  
Exterior walls—one-story buildings. For one-story buildings, metal-clad sandwich panels with  
foam plastic cores with thicknesses up to 4 inches \(102 mm\) are permitted to be installed without  
a thermal barrier, provided the metal cladding complies with the provisions outlined in Section  
2603.4.1.4 and, furthermore, the building is protected with automatic fire sprinklers. In this case,  
the code assumes that the protection and cooling effect provided by automatic sprinklers is a  
reasonable alternative to the thermal barrier.  
Roofing. A thermal barrier is not required for foam plastic insulation that is a part of a Class A,  
B, or C roof-covering assembly if the assembly is tested or constructed according to code-  
prescribed prescriptive provisions. Foam plastic may be used when the foam is separated from  
the interior of the building by minimum 0.47-inch \(12-mm\) wood structural-panel sheathing  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbonded with exterior glue. The edges of the wood structural-panel sheathing must be supported  
by blocking or be of tongue-and-groove construction or of any other approved type of edge  
support. In this case, the thermal barrier is waived, as well as the smoke-developed index.  
If foam plastic insulation is considered an integral part of the roof-covering assembly. A  
nationally recognized test standard for insulated roof decks is to be utilized. See Figure 2603-2.  
The test standards for insulated roof-deck construction are adequately conservative so that  
assemblies passing either of the two test standards are considered to meet the intent of the code  
without any limit on flame spread or smoke development. Furthermore, no thermal barrier is  
required. Additionally, most insulated metal decks that are listed require that the deck be  
nonperforated—essentially a nonacoustical deck. Acoustical decks are commonly proposed in  
gymnasiums and auditoriums for sound control purposes and would therefore require a thermal  
barrier unless specifically listed under UL 1256 or NFPA 276.  
Figure 2603-2 Foam plastic used with roof covering.  
Attics and crawl spaces. This item describes specific methods used to protect foam plastics  
located within attics and crawl spaces \(in lieu of a complying thermal barrier\) where entry is  
provided only for service of utilities. See Figure 2603-3. The phrase “where entry is provided  
only for service of utilities” is intended to restrict these reduced requirements for a thermal  
barrier to those unused areas where there are no heat-producing appliances. In addition, drop  
lights or portable service lights are often utilized when serving equipment in such concealed  
spaces, and such lighting devices pose an ignition threat to the foam plastic. Thus, the reduced  
provisions are intended to provide a barrier whose only purpose is to prevent the direct  
impingement of flame on the foam plastic.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2603-3 Foam plastic in attic and crawl spaces.  
The reduced level of protection is also applicable in those situations where the service of  
utilities is not an issue. If there are no utilities within the attic space or crawl space that require  
service, the minimum described degree of separation between the foam plastic and the enclosed  
space must still be provided where a complying thermal barrier is not installed. Where the attic  
or crawl space provides a suitable area that exists for a purpose other than the access to utilities,  
such as storage, a thermal barrier complying with Section 2603.4 is required.  
Doors not required to have a fire-protection rating. Pivoted or side-hinged doors not required  
to have a fire protection rating are permitted to be installed without the thermal barrier, provided  
the door facings are of sheet metal of the thicknesses prescribed in this section. The rationale  
behind the waiver of the thermal barrier is that the foam plastic is completely encapsulated  
within the sheet-metal facings, and the quantity of foam plastic in protected doors is quite small.  
Garage doors. Garage doors, other than those in garages accessory to dwellings, that contain  
foam plastic are allowed, provided the door does not require a fire-resistance rating and is faced  
with materials prescribed by this section. If the garage door containing the foam plastic does not  
have an aluminum, steel, or wood facing of the minimum thickness prescribed, the door must be  
tested in accordance with DASMA 107 Room Fire Test Standard for Garage Doors Using Foam  
Plastic Insulation. This provision is intended to regulate the commercial applications of  
overhead, sectional, and tilt-up types of doors.  
Siding backer board. Where it is desired to insulate exterior walls under exterior siding, the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcode permits foam plastic to be used as a backer board for the siding, provided the insulation has  
a potential heat of not more than 2,000 Btu per square foot \(22.7 mJ/m2\). The thermal barrier is  
not required under these circumstances as long as the siding backer board has a maximum  
thickness of ½ inch \(12.7 mm\) and is separated from the interior of the building by not less than  
2 inches \(51 mm\) of mineral-fiber insulation or equivalent.  
The code also permits the siding backer board without a thermal barrier when the siding is  
applied as re-siding over existing wall construction. This is reasonable considering the separation  
provided by the existing construction and limitations on the potential heat imposed by the code.  
Type V construction. The use of spray-applied foam plastic has become common in wood-  
frame construction for the sill plates, joist headers, and rim joists. Such a limited amount of foam  
plastic insulation is considered acceptable without the protection afforded by a thermal barrier.  
Testing has been conducted to evaluate the behavior of foam plastic having the density,  
thickness, flame-spread, and smoke-developed indices stipulated. The results indicated no  
substantial performance difference between a foam plastic-insulated wood floor system and a  
wood only floor system.  
Floors. Section 2603.4.1.14 provides a viable means to protect foam plastic insulation when it is  
installed within a floor system. The thermal barrier required to separate foam plastic insulation  
installed beneath a walking surface must not only be an adequate barrier to protect the foam  
plastic, but also be durable enough to withstand the load and wear-and-tear that is needed for the  
floor. With society’s focus on energy efficiency and conservation, many new types of products  
are being used that incorporate foam plastic insulation for energy reasons. One example is the  
use of structural-insulated panels where the foam plastic is laminated between two structural  
wood facings. These types of panels are often used in floor systems.  
Although a ½-inch \(12.7-mm\) wood structural panel \(i.e., plywood or oriented strand board\)  
is not by itself considered as a complying “thermal barrier” as required by Section 2603.4, it will  
fulfill the dual need for structural strength and thermal protection of the foam insulation. In the  
case of a floor, the use of such panels will provide sufficient protection because, in the event of  
an interior fire, the floor faces a reduced exposure and is typically the last building element to be  
significantly exposed by the fire. See Figure 2603-4.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2603-4 Floors with foam plastic insulation.  
It is important to note that the protection provided by wood structural panels is only accepted  
on the walking surface side of the floor. If the floor is used in multistory construction, then the  
underside of the floor system \(ceiling of the room below\) must be covered by the typically  
required thermal barrier. The thermal barrier protection on the bottom side of the assembly does  
not get to take advantage of the reduction because it will not be used as a walking surface does,  
and it will face a more severe exposure to an interior fire.  
The exception is intended to address items such as carpet padding, and other interior floor  
finishes, that do not need to be covered by a thermal barrier.  
2603.5 Exterior walls of buildings of any height. The provisions for foam plastic insulation  
also allow such material in the exterior walls of buildings required to have noncombustible  
exterior wall construction \(Types I, II, III, and IV\). Applicable to such buildings of any height,  
an important provision of this section requires that the wall be tested in accordance with NFPA  
285\. This test provides a method of evaluating the wall’s flammability characteristics that are due  
to the combustible foam plastic materials within the wall. Wall assemblies need not be tested  
where they can comply with the provisions of Section 2603.4.1.4; however, this allowance is  
only applicable to fully sprinklered, one-story buildings. Section 2603.5.1 also requires that test  
data be provided to show that if a fire-resistance rating is required, the rating of the wall  
containing the foam maintains the required rating. Moreover, the foam plastic insulation must\:  
1\. Be separated from the interior of the building with a thermal barrier meeting the  
provisions of Section 2603.4.  
2\. Not have a potential heat content exceeding that of the foam plastic insulation contained  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation3\. 4. 5. in the wall assembly as tested.  
Have a maximum flame-spread index of 25 and smoke-developed index of 450.  
Exterior coatings and facings, tested individually, must also comply with these flame-  
spread and smoke-development limitations.  
Be labeled by an approved agency.  
Comply with the ignition limitations imposed by Section 2603.5.7.  
2603.6 Roofing. As previously addressed, complying foam plastic insulation may be utilized as a  
portion of a roof-covering assembly, provided the assembly with the foam plastic insulation has  
been tested in accordance with ASTM E108 or UL 790, and has been listed as a Class A, B, or C  
roofing assembly.  
2603.9 Special approval. In this section, the code provides for those cases where foam plastic  
products and protective coverings do not comply with the specific requirements of Section  
2603.4 or 2603.6. The specific approvals are based on testing that is related to the actual end use  
of the products. The code refers to a number of test standards for determining specific approvals  
and, in addition, there are others that utilize some variation of the room test and are designed for  
testing exterior wall applications.  
Section 2605 Plastic Veneer  
Because it is a combustible material, plastic veneer used in the interior of a building is required  
by the code to comply with the interior finish requirements of Chapter 8.  
Where plastic veneer is used on the exterior of a building, the code requires that the veneer be  
of approved plastic materials as limited by Section 2606.4. This places severe restrictions on the  
combustibility and smoke development of the plastic materials. Because plastic materials are  
combustible, the code limits their attachment on any exterior wall to a height no greater than 50  
feet \(15,240 mm\) above grade. Furthermore, the IBC® limits the area of plastic veneer to 300  
square feet \(27.9 m2\) in any one section and requires each section to be separated vertically by a  
minimum of 4 feet \(1,219 mm\). The 4-foot \(1,219-mm\) separation helps control the rapid  
vertical spread of fire. The code anticipates that local fire-fighting forces can effectively fight a  
fire that involves plastic veneer up to a height of about 50 feet \(15,240 mm\). Also, if the plastic  
veneer involves too large an area, it is conceivable that a fire could overtax local fire-fighting  
forces. The exception applies to Type VB buildings where the walls are not required to have a  
fire-resistance rating. In this case, the plastic materials do not present a greatly different hazard  
than the unprotected wood construction.  
Plastic siding used on the exterior of a building is regulated separately from plastic veneer.  
The provisions of Section 2605 are not appropriate for exterior plastic siding, as the requirements  
for exterior wall coverings established in Sections 1403 and 1404 are to be applied.  
Section 2606 Light-Transmitting Plastics  
Light-transmitting plastics are those plastics used in the building envelope or with interior  
lighting to transmit light to the interior of the building. Light-transmitting plastics are regulated  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbecause they are combustible materials. The unregulated use of combustible materials in the roof  
structure and for the exterior walls can possibly defeat the intent of the provisions of the code  
relating to types of construction. Thus, Sections 2606 through 2611 regulate these materials so  
that they do not materially affect other code requirements regarding types of construction.  
Any use of light-transmitting plastic materials must be approved by the building official and  
be based on technical data submitted to substantiate their use.  
The criteria of Section 2606.4 establishes the combustibility classifications of approved  
plastic materials, determined to be either Class CC1 or CC2 in accordance with ASTM D635,  
serves as the approval basis.  
Materials of light-transmitting plastic, such as lenses, panels, grids, or baffles, located below  
independent light sources are thought of as creating a light-diffusing system. Light-diffusing  
systems are specifically regulated in Section 2606.7. Regulated as to occupancy, location,  
support, installation, and size, light-diffusing systems pose potential hazards that are due to their  
combustibility.  
Section 2608 Light-Transmitting Plastic Glazing  
Because plastic glazing materials are combustible, their use is limited to openings not required to  
be fire protected. In the case of building construction other than Type VB, their use is further  
restricted. The glazing of openings not required to be fire protected in Type VB construction is  
essentially unlimited as to the area, height, percentage, and separation requirements applicable to  
the individual glazed openings.  
For plastic-glazed openings in buildings other than Type VB, restrictions are placed on the  
area, height, percentage, and separation requirements for the individual glazed openings because  
plastic glazing materials are combustible. In other types of construction, unprotected combustible  
materials must be limited in accordance with their real extent and separation. Because of the  
combustibility of plastic glazing, the code requires flame barriers at each floor level for  
nonsprinklered multistory buildings to prevent the transmission of flame from one story to  
another by way of combustible openings.  
As with other provisions of the code limiting the height of combustible materials above grade,  
this section also limits the height of plastic materials above grade to 75 feet \(22,860 mm\) unless  
the building is sprinklered throughout.  
Section 2609 Light-Transmitting Plastic Roof Panels  
Plastic panels are regulated on the basis of three conditions, of which only one needs to be met in  
order to utilize light-transmitting plastic panels in roofs of all occupancies other than Groups H,  
I-2, and I-3. Light-transmitting plastic roof panels may be installed in buildings equipped  
throughout with an automatic sprinkler system, in buildings where the roof construction is not  
required to have a fire-resistance rating, or where the roof panels meet the requirements for roof  
coverings in accordance with Chapter 15.  
Because plastic roof panels constitute unprotected openings in the roof, the code requires that  
they be separated from each other by 4 feet \(1,219 mm\) horizontally. The minimum 4-foot  
\(1,219-mm\) separation is not mandated for fully sprinklered buildings, nor is it required in  
buildings housing low-hazard occupancies as limited by Exception 2 or 3 to Section 2609.4.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 2610 Light-Transmitting Plastic Skylight Glazing  
In this section, the requirements for skylights are more detailed than those for roof panels in  
Section 2609 because there is no limit on the type of construction or fire-protection requirements  
for the roof assembly. Furthermore, skylights have unique requirements, such as those for  
flashing and resistance to burning brands. Also, as plastic-glazed skylights provide an  
unprotected combustible assembly in the roof, limitations must be placed on the area, percentage,  
and separation of each unit. Each unit’s location on the roof relative to lot lines is regulated in a  
manner consistent with that for plastic roof panels.  
Two of the primary concerns of plastic-glazed skylights are related to flashing at the  
intersection with the roof and their ability to resist the effects of flying, burning brands.  
Therefore, with one exception, the code requires that they be mounted on a curb at least 4 inches  
\(102 mm\) above the plane of the roof so that proper flashing may be accomplished. The  
exception involves skylights on roofs that have a minimum slope of 3 units vertical in 12 units  
horizontal \(25-percent slope\) and applies only to Group R-3 occupancies and on buildings  
having unclassified roof coverings. This slope should provide adequate roof drainage to  
accommodate skylights. The slope requirements for flat or corrugated plastic-glazed skylights  
and the rise requirement for dome-shaped skylights are based on the skylights’ ability to shed  
flying brands. However, when the glazing material in the skylights can pass the Class B burning  
brands test specified in ASTM E108 or UL 790, there is no limitation on slope, either of flat or  
corrugated glazed skylights, or on rise in the case of dome-shaped skylights.  
The requirement for the protection of edges of plastic-glazed skylights or domes is to prevent  
the rapid spread of fire along the roof, as the edges of the plastic glazing material ignite more  
readily than the interior portions. Under those conditions where unclassified roof coverings are  
permitted, the metal or noncombustible edge material is not required.  
As with roof panels, the various limitations on area, percentage, and separation of skylights  
are somewhat arbitrary and, as with roof panels, are based on a consensus among knowledgeable  
experts on what is reasonable.  
KEY POINTS  
• Foam plastic is regulated for flame spread and smoke development.  
• Separation with a thermal barrier must be provided between foam plastic insulation and  
the interior of the building.  
• Containers of foam plastic and foam plastic ingredients must be labeled to prevent the  
misapplication of products not designed for their use.  
• Foam plastics used in several applications, such as masonry or concrete construction,  
cooler and freezer walls, roofing, attics and crawl spaces, and doors not required to  
have a fire-protection rating, may be installed without a thermal barrier under specified  
conditions.  
• When properly tested, foam plastic insulation is permitted in exterior walls of buildings  
required to have noncombustible exterior wall construction.  
• Light-transmitting plastics are regulated in part because they are combustible materials.

Section 2702 Emergency and Standby Power Systems  
Key Points  
All electrical components, equipment, and systems are to be designed and constructed in  
accordance with the provisions of NFPA 70\: National Electrical Code® \(NEC®\). The  
International Building Code® \(IBC®\) specifically references the NEC for its technical  
provisions. The only electrical issues addressed within this chapter of the IBC are those  
emergency and standby power systems that are required by other provisions of the code.  
Section 2702 Emergency and Standby Power Systems  
In addition to the provisions of this section, NFPA Standards 70\: National Electrical Code, 110\:  
Standard for Emergency and Standby Power Systems, and 111\: Standard on Stored Electrical  
Energy Emergency and Standby Power Systems regulate the installation of emergency and  
standby power systems. Stationary engine generators, where used to provide emergency and  
standby power, must comply with the requirements of UL 2200. This UL standard provides a  
benchmark for the evaluation of the safety and reliability of such generators. Section 2702  
provides several general provisions for emergency and standby power systems and also identifies  
19 specific situations where such systems must be provided.  
Emergency power shall be provided as follows for\:  
1\. All required externally illuminated exit signs as required by Section 1013.6.3.  
2\. Means of egress illumination in occupancies as required by Section 1008.3.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation3\. 4. Semiconductor fabrication facilities per Section 415.11.11.  
Power-operated sliding doors or power-operated locks for swinging doors in Group I-3  
occupancies, unless a remote mechanical operating release is provided.  
Standby power is required under the following conditions for\:  
1\. 2. 3. Smoke-control systems as required by Sections 404.7 and 909.  
Elevators and platform lifts that are a portion of accessible means of egress.  
Special-purpose horizontal sliding, accordion, and folding doors utilized as a component  
of a means of egress.  
4\. Auxiliary-inflation systems in membrane structures exceeding 1,500 square feet \(140

# PLUMBING  
Section 2902 Minimum Plumbing Facilities  
Section 2903 Installation of Fixtures  
Key Points  
The intent of Chapter 29 is to reference the International Plumbing Code® \(IPC®\) for the  
construction, installation, and maintenance of plumbing systems and equipment, and the  
International Private Sewage Disposal Code® \(IPSDC®\) for the regulation of private sewage  
disposal systems. In addition, the provisions of this chapter provide for the determination of  
plumbing fixture counts based on occupancy classification and occupant loads  
Section 2902 Minimum Plumbing Facilities  
2902.1 Minimum number of fixtures. This section establishes the minimum number of  
plumbing fixtures that must be provided for various occupancies based on Table 2902.1. The  
table is based on the general use groupings as classified in Table 2902.1 will be provided in a  
building designed for human occupancy.  
When determining the proper occupant load to be utilized in calculating plumbing fixture  
count, there is no specific methodology referenced. However, because the only provisions in the  
IBC® addressing occupant load calculation are found in Chapter 10, it is typically assumed that  
the approach established in Section 1004 for the means of egress should also be used for  
plumbing fixture count. The basis for most occupant load determinations, other than areas with  
fixed seating, is the density factor established in Table 1004.5. An occupant load is determined  
by dividing the floor area under consideration by the appropriate density factor.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIt should be noted that the building official also has the authority as established in the  
exception to Section 1004.5 to base the occupant load on the actual number of occupants  
anticipated, rather than the calculated number. Although the use of this exception is typically  
inappropriate for egress and fire-safety purposes, it is commonly applied for plumbing fixture  
count. The occupant load utilized for egress and fire protection requirements is purposely  
conservative by most counts because of the life-safety concerns. The occupant load to be used in  
calculating the minimum plumbing fixture count should be based on more of a convenience  
concern, recognizing the need to satisfy any sanitation issues. Therefore, the occupant load used  
in the plumbing fixture count could differ from that used as the basis for the design of the means  
of egress system. The building official should rely on all available information that will assist in  
the appropriate determination of occupant load for fixture count purposes.  
2902.1.1 Fixture calculations. Once the appropriate occupant load is determined, the minimum  
required number of fixtures is calculated by using Table 2902.1. The provisions of Section  
2902.1.1 address the method in which the fixtures are to be distributed between the sexes, and  
also note how gender-neutral provisions can be incorporated.  
For the determination of required plumbing fixtures, the total occupant load to be served by  
the plumbing facilities must first be identified. Unless modified by special conditions, the total  
occupant load is halved, assuming 50 percent of the occupants to be male, 50 percent to be  
female. The resulting occupant loads are then used when applying the table, with fixtures  
calculated individually for each of the sexes. Where the required number of fixtures contains a  
fraction, an additional fixture is required. See Application Examples 2902-1 and 2902-2. Note  
that the provisions of Section 424.2 of the IPC allow urinals as a substitution for water closets on  
a 1-to-1 basis, except that assembly and educational occupancies are allowed to replace two-  
thirds of the required water closets for males with urinals. For example, if nine water closets are  
required in a men’s toilet room in a large nightclub, it is acceptable to provide six urinals and  
only three water closets. Where the occupancy classification is other than Group A or Group E,  
only one-half of the required number of water closets may be substituted with urinals.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 2902-1  
Application Example 2902-2  
The determination of the minimum plumbing fixture count becomes a bit more complex  
where the building contains a number of different occupancies. If toilet room facilities are  
provided independently for each of the occupancies in the building, the basic method of  
calculating the number of fixtures should be satisfactory. However, if common toilet facilities are  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationdesigned to serve the occupants from multiple occupancy groups, a different approach is more  
appropriately warranted. In such a determination, the number of required fixtures for each sex  
would be calculated for each occupancy, then without rounding, added together to arrive at the  
minimum fixtures that must be provided. An example of this methodology is shown in  
Application Example 2902-3. A similar approach could be utilized when substituting urinals for  
water closets.  
Application Example 2902-3  
Exception 2 establishes the concept of multiple-user toilet facilities designed to serve all  
genders. Additional requirements for this type of facility are limited by Exception 6 of Section  
2902.2\. The general provisions continue to be applicable for the determination of the minimum  
required number of plumbing fixtures. A variety of toilet room arrangements are possible, with  
the regulation of urinal locations as the only privacy feature unique to all-gender facilities  
beyond what is already required in any multiple-user toilet room intended for use by the same  
sex. The calculation of fixture count at 100 percent is an exception to the use of the total  
occupant load divided in half \(assuming a 50/50 male/female distribution\). Application Example  
2902-4 shows how the minimum required number of fixtures is to be determined for a multiple-  
user facility available to all genders. Fixture count calculations are straightforward where the  
male/female ratios in Table 2902.1 are identical; however, some adjustment may be necessary  
where different table ratios are indicated \(such as for theaters and similar assembly uses\).  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationApplication Example 2902-4  
In referencing Section 2902.1.2, Exception 3 recognizes that it is not necessary to account for  
a distribution of male/female occupants in the application of Table 2902.1 where single-user  
facilities are provided. A designer could choose to provide all the required plumbing fixtures in  
single-user toilet rooms.  
2902.1.2 Single-user toilet and bathing room fixtures. Single-user and multiple-user facilities  
that serve all genders, including family or assisted-use toilet rooms and bathing rooms, are  
permitted to count toward the minimum required plumbing fixtures. The provisions recognize  
that the required number of fixtures can be provided based on either the required number of  
separate facilities or the aggregate of any combination of both single-user and separate facilities.  
An important requirement indicates that single-user, as well as family or assisted-use, toilet  
rooms and bathing rooms are to be identified to indicate availability for use by all individuals  
with no regard as to their sex.  
2902.2 Separate facilities. In most buildings where plumbing fixtures are required, separate  
facilities must be available for each sex. Simply, at a minimum, one women’s toilet room and  
one men’s toilet room must be provided. There are conditions, however, where only a single  
toilet room is mandated. Separate-sex facilities need not be provided within dwelling units and  
sleeping units. In addition, common facilities are permitted where the number of people \(both  
customers and employees\) does not exceed 15. In mercantile occupancies with an occupant load  
of 100 or less, such as a small retail sales tenant, a single toilet room is also permitted. Another  
condition where separate sex facilities are not required is where the occupant load of a business  
occupancy does not exceed 25.  
Exception 5 clarifies that separate facilities need not be designated by sex where single-user  
toilet rooms are provided. Reference is made to Section 2902.1.2 to reinforce the requirement  
that such single-user facilities are to be identified as being available for use by all persons  
regardless of their sex.  
Separate facilities are also exempted by Exception 6 where a multi-user toilet room is  
designed to be used by all individuals, regardless of sex, and the water closets and lavatories are  
available to everyone. It is mandated that water closet privacy be provided with complying  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationcompartments. Urinals, where installed, are to be placed in a private stall or located in a manner  
so that they are visually isolated from the remainder of the toilet room. If an accessible urinal is  
required, there is no criteria in ICC A117.1 or the IBC for the design of an accessible stall. It is  
expected that the stall, if provided, be configured to allow for the presence of a wheelchair and  
user transfer to a standing position in front of the urinal.  
2902.2.1 Family or assisted-use toilet facilities serving as separate facilities. Where each  
separate-sex toilet room is required to only have a single water closet, the required separate  
restrooms are permitted to be designated as “family or assisted-use” toilet facilities versus  
requiring the facilities to be designated for each sex. Allowing the toilet facilities to be used by  
either sex provides greater flexibility and increases overall availability.  
Where facilities are designated for a specific sex and the toilet room for one of the sexes is  
occupied or being cleaned, then a person needing that facility is typically forced to wait. This  
provision requires that two separate facilities be provided, but by eliminating the separate-sex  
designations, both of the restrooms are available to anyone and the overall availability in small  
establishments is increased.  
The selection of the term “family or assisted-use” toilet facilities is important because it  
influences how the toilet rooms are constructed. Sections 1110.2.1.2 through 1110.2.1.6 provide  
several details that affect the construction of these toilet rooms.  
2902.3 Employee and public toilet facilities. Only specific occupancies and uses are required to  
have public toilet facilities for use by customers, patrons, and visitors of the building.  
Restaurants, nightclubs, places of assembly, business uses, mercantile occupancies, and similar  
buildings and tenant spaces intended for public use must be provided with customer toilet  
facilities located within one story above or below the area under consideration, and with a path  
of travel not to exceed 500 feet \(152 m\). Those uses where public use is not expected, such as  
warehouses, factories, and similar buildings, only require employee toilet facilities.  
Two types of public-use buildings are exempted from public toilet facilities, open and  
enclosed parking garages having no parking attendants, and small quick-transaction tenant  
spaces. Pizza carryouts, dry cleaners, ATM facilities, shoe repair shops, newspaper stands, and  
many other similar spaces are unique in that patrons spend a short period of time completing a  
transaction and then depart. It should be noted that it is the public-access area and not the entire  
business that is regulated by the 300-square-foot \(28 m2\) area limitation. This allowance is  
illustrated in Figure 2902-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 2902-1 Public toilet facilities not required.  
Section 2903 Installation of Fixtures  
Installation requirements are provided for water closets, urinals, lavatories, bidets, water closet  
compartments, and urinal partitions. These items are to be installed level and in proper  
alignment. In addition, clearance and dimensional requirements set forth in IBC Section 1210, as  
well as in the IPC, are replicated to ensure they are not overlooked.  
KEY POINTS  
• The minimum required number of plumbing fixtures is based on the use of the building  
and the anticipated number of occupants.  
• Except for a limited number of situations, separate toilet facilities are required for each  
sex or gender-neutral facilities can be provided.  
• Family or assisted-use toilet rooms are permitted in lieu of separate-sex facilities under  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationlimited conditions.  
• Installation parameters are provided for standard fixtures.

Key Points  
Elevators and other types of conveying systems are regulated under the provisions of this  
chapter. For the most part, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers \(ASME\) standards  
are utilized to address the specifics of elevator safety. ICC A117.1 must also be referenced for  
all elevators required to be accessible by Chapter 11 of the International Building Code®  
\(IBC®\)  
Section 3001 General  
3001.2 Emergency elevator communication systems for the deaf, hard of hearing and  
speech impaired. In multistory buildings, passenger elevators are typically utilized as vertical  
accessible routes. In some cases, the elevators may also be considered a part of the accessible  
means of egress. The code requires that an emergency two-way communication system be  
provided for accessible elevators. In addition, the elevators and associated elevator landings must  
have accessible features complying with ICC A117.1, the IBC-referenced technical standard for  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationaccessibility. Applicable to accessible elevators, the A117.1 standard requires an emergency two-  
way communication system between the elevator car and a point outside the hoistway. The  
system must also fully comply with the provisions in ASME A17.1/CSA B44, the Safety Code  
for Elevators and Escalators as published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  
Additionally, an emergency two-way communication system is mandated by Section 3002.1.2.  
The provisions of ICC A117.1 only address requirements regarding the height of operable  
parts, identification of the system and instructions for its use. Additional communication  
capabilities are set forth in the IBC to enhance the usability of the system by individuals with  
varying degrees of hearing or speech impairments. The criteria establish direction and clarity in  
providing the appropriate accessible features.  
To provide totally accessible communication between individuals in elevators who are deaf,  
hard of hearing or speech impaired with local governmental emergency services, additional  
communication features must be provided within the elevator. The system must provide both a  
text mode and an audible mode that, during operation, allows for live interactive communication  
between those individuals within the elevator and emergency personnel. The system shall be  
operational during all times the elevator is operational, and it shall be designed to allow the  
selection of the appropriate communication mode by the elevator occupants. Such occupants  
may select either the text-based or audible mode based on their specific needs. Along with the  
necessary visual indicators and button indicators, the text-based mode would allow the use of a  
keyboard by those entrapped individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.  
3001.3 Referenced standards. Depending on the type of conveying system, Table 3001.3 lists  
the appropriate standard that must be followed for the design, construction, alteration,  
installation, and maintenance of the system. As an example, elevators must comply with ASME  
A17.1/CSA B44 while automotive lifts are required to conform to ALI ALCTV.  
Section 3002 Hoistway Enclosures  
3002.1 Hoistway enclosure protection. This section is essentially a cross reference to Section  
713 of the code, which contains the specific requirements for the enclosure of shafts in buildings.  
Elevator hoistways are to be located in fire-resistance-rated enclosures, unless exempted by  
Section 712.1.9 addressing two-story-opening conditions or another applicable provision  
addressing unprotected vertical openings. If required to be fire-resistance-rated, the shaft  
enclosure must have a 1-hour or 2-hour rating based on the number of stories connected by the  
shaft enclosure, as well as the required fire-resistance rating of the floor construction. Opening  
protectives for hoistway enclosures are also regulated by Chapter 7.  
3002.2 Number of elevator cars in a hoistway. These provisions were extracted from the  
elevator code insofar as they are more appropriate as building code requirements. The basis for  
limiting the number of cars in a single hoistway is to provide a reasonable level of assurance that  
a multilevel building served by several elevators would not have all of its elevator cars located in  
the same hoistway. This could result in a single emergency disabling all elevators within the  
building. For example, if all elevator cars were allowed to be located in the same hoistway,  
smoke that entered the enclosure during a fire would render all elevator cars unusable. The code  
provisions will increase the chance that some elevators within a major building would remain  
operational during a fire or other emergency. See Figure 3002-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 3002-1 Elevator cars in hoistways.  
3002.3 Emergency signs. In order to alert occupants to the fact that an elevator is not to be used  
for egress purposes during a fire incident, this section mandates the placement of a sign adjacent  
to each elevator call station on each floor of the building. The standardized pictorial sign \(an  
example is illustrated in Figure 3002-2\) advises occupants to use the exit stairways rather than  
the elevators in case of a fire. The emergency sign does not need to be installed at those elevators  
complying as an accessible means of egress per Section 1009.4 or at occupant self-evacuation  
elevators as described in Section 3008.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 3002-2 Emergency signs.  
3002.4 Elevator car to accommodate ambulance stretcher. Where elevators are provided in  
buildings of four stories or more in height, this section of the code requires that at least one  
elevator serving all floors accommodate an ambulance stretcher. The ability to transport an  
individual on a stretcher in an elevator in a multistory building is a basic life-safety  
consideration. Immediate identification of elevators that accommodate stretchers is necessary so  
that emergency-services personnel can quickly respond to emergency conditions. For this reason,  
an identifying symbol as shown in Figure 3002-3 shall be placed inside on both sides of the  
hoistway door frame.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 3002-3 Sign denoting accommodation of ambulance stretcher.  
Minimum elevator car size requirements have been established to ensure that the typical  
ambulance stretcher can be accommodated. The minimum 24-inch by 84-inch \(610-mm by  
2,134-mm\) size is further described to address stretchers with rounded or chamfered corners with  
a minimum 5-inch \(127-mm\) radius. See Figure 3002-4. By specifically identifying the  
minimum size requirements, flexibility is provided to the elevator industry in its efforts to  
provide appropriately sized cars. It is also beneficial to stretcher manufacturers by providing  
direction to aid in the standardization of their products.  
Figure 3002-4 Elevator used for fire department emergency access.  
3002.6 Prohibited doors. The prohibition against installing additional doors at the point of  
access to an elevator car is to minimize the possibility of a person becoming trapped between  
doors, or the possibility of the elevator car being rendered unusable because of blocked access at  
a particular floor where such an additional door has been closed and locked. The only condition  
under which such doors are permitted occurs where the doors are readily openable from the car  
side without the use of a key, a tool, or any special effort or knowledge.  
3002.7 Common enclosure with stairway. To better ensure that a single fire incident will not  
restrict or eliminate the use of multiple access or egress components within a building, it is  
important that elevators not be located in the same shaft enclosure as a stairway. Since there is no  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrequirement for a shaft enclosure for an elevator or exit stairway serving an open parking garage,  
the isolation of the elevator from the stairway is not required in open parking garages.  
Section 3003 Emergency Operations  
Standby power requirements in this section are applicable for those buildings or structures where  
standby power is furnished to, or required to, operate an elevator. For example, the provisions of  
Section 1009.4.1 mandate standby power for any elevator used as an accessible means of egress.  
The requirement that standby power be manually transferable to all elevators in each bank is  
necessary to improve their reliability during emergency conditions. As an example, the elevator  
to which standby power is connected may be in a hoistway that is unusable because of smoke  
contamination. In this case, the transferability requirement provides for transferring the  
emergency power from the elevator in the affected hoistway to an elevator in a hoistway in the  
same bank that is usable.  
Section 3006 Elevator Lobbies and Hoistway Opening  
# Protection  
3006.1 General. Distinctly different issues are addressed in the provisions of Section 3006.  
Elevator lobbies are presented as a means to protect the openings on each floor level from the  
intrusion of smoke into the elevator hoistway shaft enclosures. The spread of smoke vertically  
through a building under fire conditions is a major concern that can be addressed through the use  
of properly constructed elevator lobbies. Alternative means of addressing this concern are also  
presented in Section 3006.  
Elevator lobbies can also be an important refuge area for building occupants and emergency  
responders under varying conditions. Specific provisions include the use of elevator lobbies  
where fire department access elevators or occupant evacuation elevators are provided. Areas of  
refuge included as a part of an accessible means of egress may also include elevator lobbies to  
allow individuals with disabilities a protected area to await assistance or rescue.  
It is important to note that the scoping and application provisions of Sections 3006.2 and  
3006.3, respectively, also address elevator hoistway opening protection where the presence of a  
lobby is not necessary. In such situations, the protection is simply to limit the spread of smoke to  
other floors in the building due to intrusion into the elevator shaft. However, the use of a means  
other than an elevator lobby to provide the necessary hoistway opening protection is not allowed  
in those conditions addressed in Items 2 through 5.  
3006.2 Hoistway opening protection required. To reduce the potential for smoke to travel  
from the floor of fire origin to any other floor of the building by way of an elevator shaft  
enclosure, some means of elevator door hoistway opening protection is necessary. Typical  
elevator hoistway doors, although fire rated, cannot provide the necessary barrier required to  
keep smoke from passing from floor to floor through an elevator shaft enclosure. To restrict  
smoke passage from one floor level to other floor levels within the building, there must be some  
point where the floor level can be adequately separated from the elevator shaft. The acceptable  
methods of opening protection are established in Section 3006.3, and include the use of elevator  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationlobbies. However, hoistway opening protection is not required in all multistory buildings, as the  
requirement is not applicable where the elevator shaft connects only two or three stories. The  
threshold of four stories is consistent with a number of other code provisions that increase the  
level of protection where four or more stories are involved.  
Where an elevator hoistway required to be enclosed connects four or more stories, and at least  
one of five listed conditions applies, hoistway opening protection must be provided. Buildings  
containing a Group I-1, Condition 2, Group I-2, or Group I-3 institutional occupancy are  
addressed. For other occupancies, the presence of a sprinkler system is the deciding factor.  
Where an automatic sprinkler system is not provided, the four-story threshold is applicable.  
However, where sprinkler protection is provided, hoistway opening protection is not required  
until the building is considered a high-rise. In high-rise buildings, opening protection is only  
required for those elevator hoistways that travel more than 75 feet \(22,860 mm\), measured floor  
level to floor level.  
The three exceptions to hoistway opening protection recognize that there are times where such  
protection is either impractical or unnecessary. The first exception eliminates the opening  
protection for elevators that serve only open parking garages. This exception should also extend  
to enclosed parking garages since Section 712.1.10.2 indicates that vertical opening protection is  
not required in both open and enclosed parking garages for elevator hoistways serving only the  
parking garage. Since hoistway opening protection is simply a means to complete the elevator  
shaft enclosure protection, such opening protection is not necessary if a shaft enclosure is not  
required. Exception 2 exempts the level\(s\) of exit discharge, provided the discharge level\(s\) is  
protected with an automatic sprinkler system. A third exception recognizes that hoistway  
openings to the exterior have no need to be protected.  
3006.2.1 Rated corridors. Where a corridor is identified within a building, it may be necessary  
to introduce fire-resistance-rated construction and protected openings in order to isolate the  
means of egress path as defined by the corridor from surrounding spaces. Fire-resistance-rated  
corridors are intended to provide a protected path of travel within the exit access that will allow  
occupants to evacuate or relocate during a fire condition that occurs in spaces adjacent to the  
corridor. Such a corridor must also provide a significant degree of resistance to the movement of  
smoke into the egress environment. Where an elevator opens into a corridor required to be fire-  
resistance-rated, the elevator hoistway door can typically achieve the required degree of opening  
fire protection. However, it cannot comply with the air leakage limits mandated for a smoke- and  
draft-control assembly. An elevator hoistway door opening into a fire-resistance-rated corridor  
must be protected in accordance with one of the methods established in Section 3006.3. The  
protection provided at the elevator hoistway doors restricts the movement of smoke from the fire  
floor to other floors in the building by way of the elevator shaft enclosure.  
3006.3 Hoistway opening protection. While the scoping provisions of Section 3006.2 identify  
those conditions under which elevator hoistway opening protection is required, this section  
recognizes the methods by which such protection can be provided. Four specific methods are  
established, two of which utilize elevator lobbies. Method 1 describes elevator lobby protection  
through the use of fire partitions as lobby enclosure walls. Openings and penetrations are to be  
protected in the same manner as required for a fire-resistance-rated corridor. Method 2 differs  
from Method 1 by modifying the means for constructing the elevator lobby. Where the building  
is protected throughout with an automatic sprinkler system, this approach allows for the use of  
smoke partitions in lieu of fire partitions. Described in Section 710, smoke partitions are not  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationrequired to have a fire-resistance rating but must only be constructed to limit the transfer of  
smoke. In Method 3, additional doors may be used in lieu of an elevator lobby, provided they are  
installed in accordance with Section 3002.6. In this scenario, the lobby is not necessary, because  
the smoke-infiltration problem is addressed by the additional door. The fourth method permits  
pressurization of the elevator shaft enclosure in accordance with Section 909.21.  
Section 3007 Fire Service Access Elevator  
To facilitate the rapid deployment of fire fighters, Section 403.6.1 contains provisions for fire  
service access elevators in high-rise buildings that have at least one floor level more than 120  
feet \(36,576 mm\) above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access. Usable by fire fighters  
and other emergency responders, the specific requirements for the elevators are set forth in  
Section 3007.  
A fire service access elevator has a number of key features that will allow fire fighters to use  
the elevator for safely accessing an area of a building that may be involved in a fire or for  
facilitating rescue of building occupants. The elevator is required to be protected by a shaft  
enclosure that complies with Section 713. For a building four or more stories in height, Section  
713.4 requires that the shaft have a minimum 2-hour fire-resistance rating. In the same manner  
that elevators which can accommodate a stretcher are required to be identified by the "Star of  
Life" symbol shown in Figure 3002-3, fire service access elevators must include a symbol as  
illustrated in IBC Figure 3007.6.5 to allow for quick identification.  
An elevator lobby is mandated as a transitional element between the fire service access  
elevator and the remainder of the floor. Because the elevator lobby will be the location that fire  
fighters will use as the point of departure to the floor or area of fire origin, it must be constructed  
to limit the entrance of fire or smoke. The lobby must be enclosed by a smoke barrier with a  
minimum fire-resistance rating of 1 hour, and the lobby door is required to have a minimum fire-  
resistance rating of 45 minutes. The lobby for the fire service access elevator must be designed  
such that it has direct or protected access to an enclosure for an interior exit stairway. By  
providing a direct connection between the elevator lobby and a stair enclosure, efficient access to  
and from other floors is increased. In addition, the required standpipe hose valves located within  
the enclosure for the interior exit stairway will be directly accessible from the fire service access  
elevator lobby, providing a protected location for fire fighters to prepare for manual fire-fighting  
operations and to assess interior fire and smoke behavior near the area of fire origin.  
A unique requirement for fire service access elevators is that they must be designed so their  
status can be continuously monitored in the fire command center. The elevator is to be monitored  
by a standard emergency services interface meeting the requirements of NFPA 72, National Fire  
Alarm Code. The requirements stipulate that such an interface must be designed and arranged in  
accordance with the requirements of the organization that will use the device. In the case of a fire  
service access elevator, the fire department or fire service provider will need to be involved in  
the arrangement of the interface.  
A fire service access elevator requires normal utility power and connection to a standby  
power system. Provisions further stipulate that the transfer switch for the standby power system  
operate within 60 seconds of utility power failure \(Type 60\), and that the power source is  
designed to operate for at least 2 hours under its design load \(Class 2\) and meet the requirements  
of NFPA 110 for Level 1 service. Level 1 service, as defined by NFPA 110, indicates that the  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationstandby power system is used in a building where the loss of electrical power could result in the  
death of or serious injury to one or more occupants. Loads that must be connected to the standby  
power system include the elevator, its machine room ventilation and cooling equipment, and  
elevator hoistway lighting. An additional requirement for the electrical power system serving the  
fire service access elevator is the protection of wiring or cables. Electrical conductors that  
provide normal or standby power to the fire service access elevator must be protected. They  
should be located by a shaft or similar enclosure having a minimum 2-hour fire-resistance rating;  
or circuit integrity cable or a listed electrical protective system having an equivalent fire  
resistance must be utilized.  
Section 3008 Occupant Evacuation Elevators  
Under the conditions of Section 3008, public-use passenger elevators are allowed to be utilized  
for the self-evacuation of occupants in high-rise buildings. Although such elevators may be used  
by building occupants during building evacuation, they are not intended to replace any means of  
egress facilities as required by Chapter 10. The only permitted reduction in required egress  
facilities due to the presence of complying occupant evacuation elevators is the elimination of  
the extra exit stairway mandated by Section 403.5.2 for high-rise buildings over 420 feet \(128 m\)  
in height. Under no conditions is the installation of such elevators required. The allowance for  
occupant evacuation elevators, although voluntary, provides tools for the architect to consider  
when designing tall buildings.  
Although the use of elevators for occupant evacuation in super high-rise buildings is a viable  
and more efficient option than stairways, it can require an excessive amount of standby power.  
Therefore, the minimum number of elevators that must be considered as occupant evacuation  
elevators reflects a reasonable performance-based approach while still providing the capacity to  
evacuate a high-rise building more quickly than stairs alone.  
Two options are established for the determination of the minimum number of elevators  
required to meet the performance intent. Scenario \#1 focuses on the full evacuation of the  
building’s occupants within a 1-hour time period. This approach does not mandate full building  
evacuation, but rather is to be considered as a benchmark for the analysis. Scenario \#2 is  
generally based on a more typical phased evacuation process. The 15-minute limit criterion  
addresses the removal of occupants from the area to which the fire department will respond. The  
use of five consecutive floors in the analysis provides for a safety factor for the minimum  
required number of occupant evacuation elevators.  
Additional criteria mandate that at least one elevator in every elevator bank be provided for  
occupant evacuation. Where multiple passenger elevators open into a lobby, a minimum of two  
occupant evacuation elevators are required. These conditions ensure that as individuals reach an  
elevator lobby location there will always be one or more elevators available to them for  
evacuation purposes. In order to better identify the specific elevators that are intended for  
evacuation activities, signage must be provided indicating their availability.  
KEY POINTS  
• Elevator shafts and elevator machine rooms are typically required to be fire-resistance-  
rated enclosures, with the rating of either 1 hour or 2 hours based on the number of  
stories in the building and required fire-resistance rating of the building’s floor  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconstruction.  
• Additional doors are prohibited at the point of access to an elevator car unless they are  
readily openable from the car side without the use of a key, a tool, or any special effort  
or special knowledge.  
• Fire service access elevators help facilitate the rapid deployment of fire fighters in  
applicable high-rise buildings.  
• Although not intended to replace any required means of egress facilities, public-use  
passenger elevators are allowed to be utilized for the self-evacuation of occupants in  
high-rise buildings.

Section 3102 Membrane Structures  
Section 3103 Temporary Buildings  
Section 3104 Pedestrian Walkways and Tunnels  
Section 3106 Marquees  
Section 3111 Solar Energy Systems  
Section 3113 Relocatable Buildings  
Section 3115 Intermodal Shipping Containers  
Key Points  
Those special types of elements or structures that are not conveniently addressed in other  
portions of the International Building Code® \(IBC®\) are found in this chapter. By special  
construction, the code is referring to pedestrian walkways, tunnels, awnings, canopies,  
marquees, solar energy systems, and similar building features that are unregulated elsewhere.  
Unique types of structures are also addressed, including relocatable buildings, membrane  
structures, temporary structures, shipping container structures, and greenhouses  
Section 3102 Membrane Structures  
3102.1 General. Because membrane structures have several unique characteristics that set them  
apart from other buildings, they are regulated in Chapter 31 under the provisions for special  
construction. The regulations cover all such structures, including air-supported, air-inflated,  
cable-supported, frame-supported, and tensile membrane structures. The intent of the provisions  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationis that, except for the unique features of membrane structures, they otherwise comply with the  
code as far as occupancy requirements, allowable area, and other regulations are concerned.  
Membrane structures are typically limited to one story in height insofar as there is insufficient  
experience to justify multilevel structures enclosed with a membrane. There is an allowance for  
use in multistory buildings where the membrane structure is of noncombustible construction and  
serves as the building’s roof.  
The membrane structures regulated by the IBC are deemed to be permanent in nature, erected  
for a period of at least 180 days. Membrane structures in place for shorter periods of time, such  
as temporary tents, are to be regulated by the International Fire Code® \(IFC®\). Where a  
membrane structure is erected as a part of a permanent structure, such as a covering for a  
building, balcony, or deck, it must comply with the provisions of Section 3102 for any time  
period.  
Because of the limited hazards present in structures not used for human occupancy, such as  
water-storage facilities, water clarifiers, sewage-treatment plants, and greenhouses, only a few  
provisions are applicable where membrane structures cover these types of facilities. Limitations  
on the membrane and interior liner material, as well as the structural design, are the only criteria  
in the IBC that apply to membrane structures covering facilities not typically used for human  
occupancy.  
3102.3 Type of construction. In general, membrane structures are considered to be of Type V  
construction, except where the membrane structure is shown to be noncombustible. In this case,  
the membrane structure should be classified as Type IIB construction. Membrane structures  
supported by heavy-timber framing members are to be considered Type IV-HT construction. The  
code permits the use of nonflame-resistant plastic material for the membrane of a greenhouse  
structure that is not available to the general public.  
3102.6 Mixed construction. This section permits the use of a noncombustible membrane on a  
structure that would otherwise comply as Type IA, IB, or IIA where the membrane is used  
exclusively as a roof or skylight and is located at least 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) above any floor,  
balcony, or gallery. This exception is similar to Footnote b of Table 601. This exception will  
permit nonrated noncombustible membranes to be constructed as roof systems for sports  
stadiums and similar buildings as well as for atriums. In other types of construction under the  
same conditions, the membrane need only be flame resistant.  
3102.8 Inflation systems. Where membrane structures are air-supported or air-inflated, this  
section addresses the regulations for equipment, standby power, and support. The primary  
inflation system shall consist of one or more blowers, designed in such a manner that over  
pressurization is prevented. Air-supported or air-inflated structures exceeding 1,500 square feet  
\(140 m2\) in floor area must also be provided with an ancillary inflation system. This backup  
system, connected to an approved standby power-generating system, shall operate automatically  
to maintain the inflation of the structure if the primary system fails.  
Additional support for the membrane must also be provided where covering structures that  
have occupant loads of at least 50 and in those cases where covering swimming pools.  
Section 3103 Temporary Buildings  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationSpecial requirements that are applicable to temporary structures are set forth in Section 3103. For  
the purpose of applying the applicable code provisions,  
“temporary” is considered as being  
erected for a time period of less than 180 days. The IFC contains a significant number of  
provisions applicable to such structures. In addition, the IBC identifies some key criteria that  
must be applied to temporary structures, including conformity with the structural strength, fire  
safety, means of egress, accessibility, light, ventilation and sanitary requirements. Permits are  
typically required, as are construction documents. The scope of Section 3103 includes special  
event structures \(see Figure 3103-1\), tents, umbrella structures, and other membrane structures.  
Figure 3103-1 Special event structures at music festival.  
Because special event structures are temporary in nature, such structures are primarily  
regulated by the IFC for the purposes of approval, permitting, length of use, document submittal,  
location on lot and inspections. In addition to the provisions mandated by the IFC, limited  
requirements of the IBC must also be met. Where the structure is to remain in place for a period  
of 180 days or more, it is to be regulated in the same manner any other “permanent” building or  
structure by the applicable provisions of the IBC.  
Section 3104 Pedestrian Walkways and Tunnels  
This section regulates connecting elements between buildings, such as tunnels or pedestrian  
walkways, that are utilized for occupant circulation. The provisions of this section are only  
applicable to such tunnels and walkways designed primarily as circulation elements, typically for  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationweather-protection purposes. A covered walkway or bridge connecting two buildings is the most  
common example of a pedestrian walkway. These elements may be located below, at, or above  
grade. When in compliance with this section, pedestrian walkways and tunnels are not  
considered to contribute to the floor area or height of the connected buildings. In addition, those  
buildings connected by the pedestrian walkway or tunnel are permitted to be considered separate  
structures. These allowances establish the primary reason for the use of this section. Where  
multiple structures are attached, they would generally be considered by the code to be a single  
building and regulated as such. These provisions not only allow each building to be regulated  
independently, but also limit the requirements of the tunnel or pedestrian walkway to those  
provisions of this section. A common use of pedestrian walkways is the connection of buildings  
that are on separate lots, including situations where the buildings are on opposite sides of a  
public way. Often referenced as skyways in northern climates, pedestrian walkways allow for a  
method to connect buildings across lot lines without the normally mandated fire-resistance-rated  
exterior walls and opening prohibition associated with a fire separation distance of zero. The  
pedestrian walkway is treated as a nonbuilding and therefore is not regulated where it crosses the  
lot line. Instead, this approach allows for a level of fire protection at the connection between the  
buildings and the pedestrian walkway.  
It is important to understand that this section is essentially voluntary in application, and is  
only utilized where the design professional chooses not to consider the walkway and connected  
buildings a single structure. There is always the option of regulating the entire structure as a  
single building, in which case this section would have no application. See Figure 3104-1.  
Figure 3104-1 Pedestrian walkways.  
This section establishes specific requirements for the protection of walls and openings  
between the connected buildings and the pedestrian walkway or tunnel, specifies minimum and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationmaximum widths, and limits the length of exit access travel within a pedestrian walkway or  
tunnel. Section 3104.3 further requires that pedestrian walkways be constructed of  
noncombustible materials or of fire-retardant-treated wood unless all connected buildings are of  
combustible construction.  
As previously mentioned, where pedestrian walkways and tunnels are designed and  
constructed in accordance with the provisions of this section, the code intends that they not be  
considered as a part of the connected buildings. Furthermore, they need not be considered in the  
determination of the allowable area or height of either of the connected buildings. In effect, this  
section is an exception to the general construction requirements, and its use is optional.  
Otherwise, the designer would consider the connected buildings to be a single building on the  
same lot, including the pedestrian walkway portion.  
Section 3106 Marquees  
A marquee is defined in Section 202 as a canopy with a flat, or relatively flat, roof surface  
located in close proximity to operable building openings. A canopy is defined as a permanent  
roof structure or architectural projection that is structurally independent or attached to and  
supported by a building. A classic example of a marquee is the theater marquee or the entrance  
marquee at a hotel. The restrictions placed on the construction, projection, and clearances for  
marquees are intended to prevent interference with\:  
1\. 2. 3. The free movement of pedestrians.  
Trucks and other tall vehicles using the public street.  
The fire department in its fire-fighting operations at a building.  
4\. Utilities.  
Thus, the height, construction, and location of the marquee are regulated to meet the intent of  
the code. Figure 3106-1 depicts the permissible projection and clearances required for marquees.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 3106-1 Marquees.  
Section 3111 Solar Energy Systems  
While solar-related provisions are found in several other locations of the IBC, Section 3111 is  
considered the catch-all section for requirements associated with solar energy systems. It  
addresses specific requirements for both photovoltaic \(PV\) and thermal systems. Most of this  
section refers the user to the structural requirements covered in Chapter 16, or other codes and  
referenced standards for the appropriate design and listing of solar PV or thermal systems. These  
codes and standards include the National Electrical Code \(NFPA 70\), International Plumbing  
Code® \(IPC®\), International Mechanical Code® \(IMC®\), International Fire Code \(IFC\), ICC  
900, ICC 901, UL 1703, UL 1741, and UL 61730. In addition, this section clarifies that roof-  
mounted solar PV systems must meet the fire classification requirements of Section 1505.9 and  
that appropriate access and pathways are to be provided in accordance with Section 1205 of the  
IFC.  
Section 3113 Relocatable Buildings  
Section 202 defines a relocatable building as “a partially or completely assembled building  
constructed and designed to be reused multiple times and transported to different building sites.  
”  
Construction trailers, modular school buildings, and many other prefabricated buildings would  
likely be classified as relocatable buildings. The only exception applies to a manufactured  
housing unit that is used as a dwelling. All relocatable buildings must comply with this section as  
well as Chapter 14 of the International Existing Building Code® \(IEBC®\).  
When proposing to install a relocatable building for the first time, or moving a relocatable  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationbuilding to a new site, a permit must be obtained from the building official. When doing so the  
applicant is required to submit an application in accordance with Section 105, provide  
construction documents per Section 107, and provide additional information as outlined in  
Section 3113.2. Key elements of this supplemental information include the original design  
drawings and applicable structural design loads considered in the design. In addition, Section  
3113.3 requires that the manufacturer’s data plate be attached on, or near, the electrical panel and  
that the information on this data plate coincides with the information submitted in the permit  
application.  
Section 3115 Intermodal Shipping Containers  
The re-use of intermodal shipping containers as buildings or structures has become quite  
common. Section 3115 addresses the minimum safety requirements that should be considered in  
relation to these containers without duplicating existing code provisions. This section clarifies  
additional dimensional and structural requirements that need to be included with the construction  
documents. In addition, it requires that a third-party inspection be performed of the container  
prior to re-purposing it. This third-party inspection will verify that a data plate is attached to the  
container and that all appropriate information is known prior to retrofitting the container for use  
within a building or structure. Several other requirements are outlined, including specific  
structural requirements for shipping containers that conform to ISO 1496-1.  
KEY POINTS  
• Membrane structures include those buildings that are air-supported, air-inflated, cable-  
or frame-supported, and tensile-supported.  
• Noncombustible membrane structures are classified as Type IIB construction, whereas  
combustible membrane structures are considered Type VB.  
• Air-supported or air-inflated membrane structures are regulated for equipment, standby  
power, and support.  
• Complying pedestrian walkways and tunnels are not considered to contribute to the  
floor area or height of the connected buildings.  
• Marquees are to be of noncombustible construction and have dimensional and location  
limitations.  
• Relocatable buildings are required to comply with Section 3113 as well as IEBC  
Chapter 14.  
• Intermodal shipping containers used for, or within, buildings and structures require  
special documentation in addition to a third-party inspection confirming the data plate  
information prior to re-use.

# ENCROACHMENTS INTO THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY  
Section 3201 General  
Section 3202 Encroachments  
Key Points  
By using the language “encroachments into the public right-of-way,  
” the code is referring to  
the projections of appendages and other elements from the building that are permitted to  
project beyond the lot line of the building site and into the public right-of-way. The intent of  
the code is that projections from a building into the public right-of-way shall not interfere with  
its free use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and shall not interfere with public services such  
as fire protection and utilities  
Section 3201 General  
The International Building Code® \(IBC®\) requires that any construction that projects into or  
across the public right-of-way be constructed as required by the code for buildings on private  
property. Furthermore, the intent is that the provisions of this chapter are not considered so as to  
permit a violation of other laws or ordinances regulating the use and occupancy of public  
property. Many jurisdictions have ordinances regulating the use and occupancy of public  
property that go beyond the provisions of this chapter, many of which may be more restrictive  
and not permit the projections permitted by the IBC. Where there are no other ordinances that  
prohibit such construction, it is the intent of this chapter to permit the construction of the  
connecting structure between buildings either over or under the public way.  
These types of permanent uses of the public way are often permitted by the jurisdiction under  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationa special license issued by the public works agency. Where these uses create no obstruction to  
the normal use of the public way, the jurisdiction, by authorizing connecting structures between  
buildings on either side of the public way, can derive revenue from a licensing agreement, which  
can be of assistance in maintaining the public right-of-way.  
The code prohibits roof drainage water from a building to flow over a public walking surface,  
as well as any water collected from an awning, canopy, or marquee, and condensate from  
mechanical equipment. The intent is not necessarily to prevent drainage water from flowing over  
public property in general, but rather to prevent drainage water from flowing over a sidewalk or  
pedestrian walkway that is between the building and the public street or thoroughfare.  
There are at least two problems that arise when drainage water from a building or structure is  
allowed to flow over a public sidewalk\:  
1\. Under proper conditions of light and temperature, algae will form where the water flows  
across the sidewalk and create a hazardous, slippery walking surface.  
2\. During heavy rain storms, the velocity and force of the water emitting from the drain  
can create hazardous walking conditions for pedestrians.  
Therefore, the usual procedure is to carry the drain lines from the roof or other building  
elements inside the building through the wall of the building and under the sidewalk through a  
curb opening into the gutter.  
Section 3202 Encroachments  
The projection of any structure or appendage is generally regulated in regard to its relationship to  
grade. Those encroachments found below grade, such as structural supports, vaults, and  
areaways, are governed in one fashion. Those encroachments located above grade, but below 8  
feet \(2,438 mm\) in height, are more severely controlled because of their immediate location  
adjacent to public areas. Although projections that are located 8 feet \(2,438 mm\) or more above  
grade tend to have fewer implications, such encroachments are also regulated.  
3202.1 Encroachments below grade. Footings, foundations, piles, and similar structural  
elements that support the building and are erected below grade are not permitted to project  
beyond the lot lines. There is an allowance for footings that support exterior walls, provided the  
projection does not extend more than 12 inches \(305 mm\) beyond the street lot line, and that the  
footings or supports are located at least 8 feet \(2,438 mm\) below grade. In this exception, the  
code assumes that there will be no utilities or other public facilities below this depth adjacent to  
the building and, therefore, permits footings to project a limited amount where they are below  
the 8-foot \(2,438-mm\) depth. It should be noted that this encroachment is permitted for street  
walls only and does not apply to interior lot lines. See Figure 3202-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 3202-1 Encroachments below grade.  
Where vaults, basements, and other enclosed spaces are located below grade in the public  
right-of-way, they shall be further regulated by the ordinances and conditions of the applicable  
governing authority. In many cases, the space below the sidewalk or other area adjacent to the  
building in the public right-of-way is not used for public purposes such as utilities, sewers, and  
storm drains \(except for catch basins\); therefore, where local ordinances do not prohibit the use  
of space beneath the sidewalk or other public area, the code permits its use by adjoining property  
owners. Usually the basement or other enclosed space of an adjoining building is extended  
beneath the public right-of-way and is used for any of the uses permitted by the code. This is a  
revocable permission, as the jurisdiction may find at a later date that there is a public need for the  
public use of the space beneath grade.  
3202.2 Encroachments above grade and below 8 feet in height. Building components that  
may arbitrarily project into the public right-of-way pose a considerable hazard to pedestrians or  
other users of the right-of-way. Therefore, doors and windows are prohibited from opening into  
such an area. However, certain features of the building that are permanent in nature are permitted  
to encroach into the public right-of-way to a limited degree. Where steps are permitted by other  
provisions of the IBC, they may project into the right-of-way up to 12 inches \(305 mm\),  
provided they are protected by guards at least 3 feet \(914 mm\) high or similar protective  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationelements such as columns or pilasters. The intent of the provision is that the encroachment be  
small enough so as not to obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic and yet provide some protection  
for occupants of the building to look each way before proceeding into the right-of-way.  
Encroachments into the public right-of-way for certain architectural features are also  
permitted, but again, only a limited projection is allowed. For columns or pilasters, the maximum  
projection is 12 inches \(305 mm\). Other architectural features such as lintels, sills, and pediments  
are limited to a 4-inch \(102-mm\) projection. Awnings, including valances, may only extend into  
the public right-of-way when the vertical clearance from the right-of-way to the lowest part of  
the awning is at least 7 feet \(2,134 mm\).  
3202.3 Encroachments 8 feet or more above grade. The code permits the projection of  
awnings, canopies, marquees, signs, balconies, and similar architectural features at a height of 8  
feet \(2,438 mm\) or more in accordance with Figures 3202-2 and 3202-3. The intent of the code is  
that no projection should be permitted near the level of the public right-of-way and up to 8 feet  
\(2,438 mm\) in height so that the free passage of pedestrians along the sidewalk or other walking  
surface will not be inhibited. At the 8-foot \(2,438-mm\) height and above, projections are  
permitted as long as they do not interfere with public utilities. It is generally assumed that utility  
lines for telephones or power will not occupy this zone except for the service entrances to the  
buildings. There are jurisdictions that have high-voltage power lines running along the sidewalk,  
and the regulations of the agency that regulates the power companies generally require certain  
clearances from these lines. Therefore, in addition to the requirements shown in Figures 3202-2  
and 3202-3, power-line clearances should also be checked, and the requirements of the National  
Electrical Code® should be reviewed when it is adopted by the jurisdiction. Where such awnings,  
canopies, balconies, and similar building elements are located 15 feet \(4,572 mm\) or more above  
grade, their encroachment is unlimited.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 3202-2 Awning, canopy, marquee, and sign projections.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 3202-3 Balcony and appendage projections.  
It is not uncommon to find a pedestrian walkway or a similar circulation element to be  
constructed over a public right-of-way. Such a condition is permitted subject to the approval of  
the local authority having jurisdiction. In no case, however, should the vertical clearance  
between the right-of-way and the lowest part of the walkway be less than 15 feet \(4,572 mm\). A  
clearance of at least 15 feet \(4,572 mm\) allows not only for unobstructed pedestrian travel but for  
vehicular access as well.  
KEY POINTS  
• Encroachments into an adjoining public right-of-way are permitted both above and  
below grade under specified conditions.  
• Where located below grade, structural supports, vaults, and other enclosed spaces are  
regulated.  
• Where located above grade, the types of encroachments addressed include steps,  
awnings, canopies, marquees, signs, architectural features, and mechanical equipment.

Key Points  
This chapter deals with safety practices during the construction process, as well as the  
protection of property, both public and private, adjacent to the construction site. Included in  
the provisions are requirements addressing site work; protection of pedestrians; and temporary  
use of streets, alleys, and public property. Special issues relating to fire extinguishers, exits,  
standpipes, automatic sprinkler systems, water supply for fire protection and fire watches are  
also addressed  
Section 3302 Construction Safeguards  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationWhere an existing building continues to be occupied during the process of remodeling or  
constructing an addition, it is very important that the life- and fire-safety features of the building  
continue to be in place. Required exits shall be maintained, the strength of structural elements  
shall not be diminished, fire-protection devices are to remain in working condition, and sanitary  
facilities shall be fully functional. These features must be maintained at all times during any  
remodeling, alterations, repairs, or additions to the building under consideration. Obviously,  
there will be times when the specific protective feature is the element or device being altered or  
repaired. In this case, an equivalent method shall be provided to safeguard the occupants.  
Chapter 33 of the International Fire Code® \(IFC®\) is referenced for fire safety during  
construction, as stated in Section 3302.3.  
Section 3303 Demolition  
As the work of demolishing a building is subject to so many variations and so many different  
hazards, the International Building Code® \(IBC®\) authorizes the building official to require the  
submission of plans and a complete schedule of the demolition. Under certain circumstances,  
pedestrian protection may be required during the demolition process. Such protection shall be  
provided in compliance with other provisions of Chapter 33. For some multilevel buildings and  
for certain types of demolition operations, it may also be necessary to temporarily close the  
street. Once the structure has been demolished, any resulting excavation is to be filled consistent  
with the existing grade, or in any other manner in conformance with the ordinances of the  
jurisdiction. As with construction, Chapter 33 of the IFC is referenced for fire safety during  
demolition.  
Section 3304 Site Work  
The provisions in Section 3304.1 for excavations and fills are intended to apply to the specific  
area where the building or structure will be located. This section is not intended to address  
massive grading on a site. For those requirements, one would turn to Section 1804, as well as any  
local grading ordinance that might be in effect. To prevent decay and to eliminate an avenue of  
entrance for termites and other insects, the code requires that the area of the site occupied by the  
building be free of all stumps, roots, and any loose or casual lumber. Typically applicable in the  
construction of wood-framed structures, the requirements also address wood forms that have  
been used in placing concrete, as well as any loose or casual wood that might be in direct contact  
with the ground under the building.  
The IBC limits the slopes for permanent fills or cut slopes for permanent excavations for  
structures to two units horizontal in one unit vertical \(50-percent slope\). Although steeper-cut  
slopes are permitted where substantiating data are submitted, the limitation on filled slopes of  
two units horizontal in one unit vertical \(50-percent slope\) is an absolute limitation, and filled  
slopes may not be steeper. Although cut slopes into natural soils may be excavated with a slope  
steeper than 50 percent, depending on the nature of the soil materials and the density, the code  
reasons that fill slopes must not be steeper than 50 percent to cover unprecedented circumstances  
such as heavy rains creating overly saturated soils or, in the case of seismic activity, vibration of  
the soils during an earthquake causing failures of steep-filled slopes.  
Understandably, the code requires that fill or surcharge loads should not be placed adjacent to  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationan existing building or structure unless the existing building or structure is structurally capable of  
resisting the additional loads caused by the fills or surcharge. See Figure 3304-1. Alternatively,  
the existing building can be strengthened in order to resist the additional loading.  
Figure 3304-1 Surcharge load on adjacent building.  
The code requires that existing footings or foundations that may be affected by an excavation  
be adequately underpinned or otherwise protected. For obvious reasons, it is the intent of the  
code that excavations in close proximity to an existing footing shall not be made unless proper  
protective measures are taken for the existing building. These measures may involve  
underpinning of the existing foundations, or shoring and bracing of the excavations, so that the  
existing building foundations will not settle or lose lateral support.  
Where the excavation is for a new building foundation and the new footing is at an elevation  
below, but within reasonably close proximity to, an existing foundation, underpinning is the  
usual procedure to protect the existing foundation. If the existing footing is for the structure that  
creates a horizontal thrust, the means of providing lateral support may take the form of a  
buttressed retaining wall designed to resist the lateral thrust of the existing foundation.  
Where buildings are to be supported by fills, the code requires that the fills be placed in  
accordance with accepted engineering practice. Thus, fills utilized for the support of buildings  
must be designed by a geotechnical engineer \(soils engineer\) utilizing the principles of  
geotechnical engineering so as to provide a proper and adequate foundation for the structure  
above, and one that will limit settlements to tolerable levels. In order to verify the adequacy of  
the geotechnical design of the fills, the IBC permits the building official to ask for a soil  
investigation report outlining the geotechnical design of the fill materials, as well as a report of  
the satisfactory placement of the fill.  
Section 3306 Protection of Pedestrians  
Both Section 3306 and Chapter 32 regulate the use of public streets and sidewalks. Section 3306  
provides those general regulations and criteria for the temporary use of public property, which  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationare generally found to apply to most jurisdictions.  
As the nature and philosophy of each jurisdiction varies, so do the regulations each  
promulgates regarding the use of public property and, in particular, the use of streets and  
sidewalks. Adjacent property owners have rights of access to their property. The public street  
also provides access for public services such as fire and police protection, street sweeping and  
maintenance, street lighting, trash pickup, and other services provided by the jurisdiction or its  
contractors. Utilities serving adjacent property also use the public street for access.  
Pedestrians must be protected from the potential hazards that exist during construction or  
demolition operations adjacent to the public way. The type of protection depends on the type of  
operation being conducted. For example, an excavation directly adjacent to a pedestrian path  
would necessitate a minimum of a construction railing along the side facing the excavation. It is  
also possible that a barrier would be required. Where the pedestrian path extends into the public  
street, a construction railing is required on the street side of the walkway to protect the  
pedestrians from vehicular traffic. Table 3306.1 provides the criteria for determining whether or  
not additional protection is required, depending on the height and proximity of the construction  
operations to the pedestrian walkway. The level of protection mandated by the table is shown in  
Figure 3306-1. Depending on these various parameters, the protection required will vary from  
none or merely a construction railing to a barrier or covered walkway.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure 3306-1 Pedestrian protection.  
3306.2 Walkways. A public jurisdiction provides sidewalks and streets for the free passage of  
vehicular and pedestrian traffic. In the case of pedestrian traffic, the usual procedure is to provide  
a sidewalk on each side of the street. Therefore, when construction or demolition operations are  
conducted on property adjacent to the sidewalk, the code requires a walkway at least 4 feet  
\(1,219 mm\) wide to be maintained in front of the building site for pedestrian use. However, in  
those cases where pedestrian traffic is unusually light, the jurisdiction may authorize the fencing  
and closing of the sidewalk to pedestrian use. The walking surface, in addition to being durable,  
must be in compliance with the accessibility provisions of Chapter 11. The walkway shall also be  
designed to support all imposed loads, with a minimum design live load of 150 pounds per  
square foot \(7.2 kN/m2\).  
3306.3 Directional barricades. Where the temporary walkway used for pedestrian travel around  
a construction or demolition site extends into the street, it is critical that a sufficient barrier be  
provided to direct vehicular traffic away from the walkway. The construction of the barrier is to  
be large enough to ensure that motorists will easily and quickly identify the revised traffic path.  
3306.4 Construction railings. The code only requires an open-type guardrail 3 feet, 6 inches  
\(1,067 mm\) in height where a construction railing is required. The intent of the railing is to direct  
pedestrians as they travel adjacent to construction areas, as well as to provide a very limited  
degree of protection. Where access must be further regulated, such as adjacent to an excavation,  
additional provisions must be applied. It is incumbent that the jurisdiction adequately protect  
pedestrians from the hazards associated with construction or demolition work.  
3306.5 Barriers. The intent of the code is that a barrier, where required, be solid and sturdy  
enough to prevent impacts from construction operations from penetrating the barrier and injuring  
passing pedestrians. Because of this intent, the code also requires that the barrier be at least 8 feet  
\(2,438 mm\) in height and extend along the entire length of the building site. Although the IBC  
requires openings in the barrier to be protected by doors that are normally kept closed, the code  
does not intend to prevent the use of small viewports at eye level so that passing pedestrians may  
stop and view the construction operations if they wish.  
To provide a reasonable level of protection from the construction operations, barriers are to be  
designed to resist loads as required in Chapter 16. As an option, specific construction procedures  
are outlined in Section 3306.6. The procedures address the size and spacing of studs as well as  
the size and span limitations for wood structural panels used in the barrier.  
3306.7 Covered walkways. A covered walkway is required for the same reasons as a protective  
barrier—to prevent falling objects from endangering passing pedestrians. Therefore, the code  
requires that the design be such that the roof and supporting structure is capable of preventing  
falling objects from breaking through. With a minimum required clear height of 8 feet \(2,438  
mm\) measured from the floor surface to the canopy overhead, the covered walkway must be  
adequately illuminated at all times. Pedestrians using walkways adjacent to building sites where  
construction or demolition operations are taking place have every right to safe passage and to be  
protected from falling debris and other hazards of construction operations.  
Because a covered walkway is intended to protect pedestrians against construction operations,  
including demolition, the canopy structure should be structurally designed to serve that purpose.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThus, the code provides two means for the design of the canopy\:  
1\. A structural design to withstand the actual loads to which it will be subjected, provided  
the design live load is not less than 150 pounds per square foot \(7.18 kN/m2\).  
2\. A prescriptive design in accordance with this section of the code where the covered  
walkway will not be subjected to a live load greater than 150 pounds per square foot  
\(7.18 kN/m2\).  
The exception provides for a permissive design based on a live load of 75 pounds per square  
foot \(3.56 kN/m2\) for the covered walkway where the construction operation is limited to the  
erection of a new, small, light-frame building not more than two stories above grade plane.  
3306.9 Adjacent to excavations. Where a site excavation occurs within 5 feet \(1,524 mm\) of the  
street lot line, it must be enclosed with a barrier not less than 6 feet \(1,829 mm\) in height. The  
barrier must be constructed to resist the wind pressures specified in Chapter 16, but need not  
meet the general barrier requirements of Section 3306.6. The building official also has the  
authority to require a barrier around excavations in those cases where the excavation is more than  
5 feet \(1,524 mm\) from the street lot line. Because of the potential liability involved, it is  
probable that most excavations of considerable size or hazard would be enclosed by a complying  
barrier.  
Section 3307 Protection of Adjoining Property  
It is critically important that during construction, remodeling, or demolition work, any adjoining  
public or private property be protected from damage. Essentially, all portions of the neighboring  
structure must be protected from damage, including footings, foundations, exterior or party  
walls, chimneys, skylights, roofs, and other building elements. In addition, water run-off must be  
controlled to prevent erosion. Although there are no specific requirements laid out in the IBC for  
the level of protection required, the intent of the protection is based on common-law precepts,  
such as that of lateral support where it comes to footings and foundations. Over the years,  
common law and, more recently, statute law have established the requirements for lateral  
support. That is, the owner of a piece of real property shall be entitled to the lateral support of the  
property by adjacent property. Responsible practice would also dictate a satisfactory level of  
protection for other portions of the adjacent site and building during the construction process.  
Where excavation work is to be performed, the person responsible for such work shall notify  
the owners of any adjoining buildings. The written notice, to be delivered no less than 10 days  
prior to the initiation of the excavation work, shall indicate that excavation work is to take place  
and that protection of the adjoining buildings should be considered. Appropriate action should be  
taken where access to an adjoining site or building is desired in order to provide the proper  
protective measures. If shoring or similar excavation retention systems are required, they shall be  
designed by a registered design professional and monitoring shall be provided to ensure that  
adverse movement is not occurring within the retention system or adjacent structures.  
Section 3308 Temporary Use of Streets, Alleys, and Public  
# Property  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationIt is important that access to essential facilities be maintained where construction materials and  
equipment are temporarily stored on public property. Obstructions shall not block access to such  
fire protection features as standpipes, fire hydrants, or alarm boxes, as well as any catch basins or  
manholes that might be present. In regard to maintaining safe and effective vehicular traffic in  
the area where construction materials and equipment are stored, such materials or equipment  
must be located at least 20 feet \(6,096 mm\) from the street intersection, or otherwise located  
where sight lines are not obstructed.  
Section 3309 Fire Extinguishers  
It is quite common for combustible debris and waste materials to accumulate in and around a  
building under construction. Therefore, at least one approved portable fire extinguisher sized for  
at least ordinary hazard and complying with Section 906 of the IFC is to be provided at every  
stairway on all floor levels where combustible material has accumulated. In addition to those  
extinguishers required within the building, every storage shed and construction shed shall also  
contain an approved fire extinguisher. Additional extinguishers may be required by the building  
official where any special or unique hazards exist, such as the presence of flammable or  
combustible liquids.  
Section 3310 Means of Egress  
Once a building under construction reaches a considerable height, deemed to be 40 feet \(12,192  
mm\) by the IBC, there is a need to provide at least one stairway that is available and usable for  
egress purposes. The temporary stairway shall be adequately illuminated during those times  
where there are occupants who may need to utilize the stairway. A temporary stairway need not  
be provided where there is at least one permanent stairway that is maintained and usable as the  
construction progresses.  
Section 3311 Standpipes  
For those buildings required to have a permanent standpipe system per Section 905.3.1, during  
construction operations a standpipe system must also be installed before the construction height  
exceeds 40 feet \(12,192 mm\) above the lowest level of fire department access. As construction  
continues to proceed upward, the standpipes shall also be extended in a timely manner. A  
standpipe shall always be available within one floor of the highest point of construction having  
secured decking or flooring. During construction operations, the amount of combustible  
materials from concrete forms, scaffolding, plastic and canvas tarpaulins, and other materials are  
prevalent not only throughout the building, but throughout the construction site itself. Thus, in  
many cases, the standpipe system provides the only source of water for fire-fighting operations.  
A minimum of one standpipe is required, with hose connections to be located in accessible  
areas adjacent to usable stairs. The standpipes may be either temporary or permanent, but in all  
cases shall meet the minimum requirements of Section 905 for capacity, outlets, and materials.  
The water supply may also be either temporary or permanent, as long as it is available at the first  
sign of combustible material accumulation.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Section 3313 Water Supply for Fire Protection  
Tall buildings of combustible construction are becoming more common, and with that, it has  
become more common for fires to occur at projects that are under construction. An “approved”  
water supply is to be provided at the site prior to the arrival of combustible materials. However,  
it is quite common that the fire protection water infrastructure is not in place by the time vertical  
construction of the building commences. Section 3313 highlights the need for ensuring that  
either a permanent or temporary fire protection water source is provided for projects of  
combustible construction, with a minimum fire protection water supply of 500 gallons per  
minute available once combustible materials are brought to the site.  
Section 3314 Fire Watch During Construction  
Some of the most hazardous conditions related to buildings often are present during the  
construction process. Recent fires that have occurred at construction sites during times of no  
activity have demonstrated the need for early notification that can only be provided by fire watch  
personnel. The lack of fire alarm and detection devices during the construction process requires  
an alternative approach to identifying and communicating the presence of a fire event. In order to  
protect adjacent properties from fire in a building of considerable height when under  
construction, provisions give authority to the fire code official to require a fire watch during  
those hours where no construction work is being done.  
Fires in sizable buildings under construction have the potential for significant heat release due  
to the fire loading created by building components and other materials used in the building’s  
construction. For this reason, a fire watch is to be provided where any one of three conditions  
exist\: \(1\) the height of construction exceeds 40 feet \(12,192 mm\) above the lowest adjacent  
grade, \(2\) multistory construction has more than 50,000 square feet \(4,645 m2\) per story, or \(3\)  
as required by the fire code official.  
It is expected that the requirement applies only to new construction. It is not intended for the  
provisions to be applied to alterations and other types of minor construction activity. Existing  
buildings would be regulated by a comprehensive fire-safety plan. Although the potential for a  
sizable fire load requiring implementation of a fire watch program would be more probable for a  
building of combustible construction, there are no conditions based on the building’s  
construction type.  
KEY POINTS  
• Where an existing building continues to be occupied during the process of remodeling  
or constructing an addition, it is very important that the life- and fire-safety features of  
the building continue to be in place.  
• Once the structure has been demolished, any resulting excavation is to be filled,  
consistent with the existing grade.  
• The code requires that fills or surcharge loads not be placed adjacent to an existing  
building unless the existing building is structurally capable of resisting the additional  
loads caused by the fills or surcharge.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation• Pedestrians must be protected from the potential hazards that exist during construction  
or demolition operations adjacent to the public way.  
• Depending on various conditions, required pedestrian protection varies from none, to  
merely a construction railing, to a barrier, to a covered walkway.  
• During construction, remodeling, or demolition work, any adjoining public or private  
property must be protected from damage.  
• Fire extinguishers, means of egress, standpipes, water supply and fire watch are all  
important requirements for maintaining fire safety during construction.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation CHAPTER  
# 34  
# RESERVED  
This chapter is designated as “Reserved” for future use. The chapter previously contained  
provisions for the regulation of existing buildings. Section 101.4.7 was established to indicate  
that the International Existing Building Code® is to be applied to all matters governing the  
repair, alteration, change of occupancy, and addition to and relocation of existing buildings.  
Chapter 34 is now considered as a placeholder for any future new chapter that may be added  
to the IBC®  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation CHAPTER  
# 35  
# REFERENCED STANDARDS  
The International Building Code® \(IBC®\) is, for the most part, a performance-based code.  
Thus, the IBC contains numerous references to standards that are intended to assist in the  
application of the code. Where standards are referenced in the body of the IBC, they are  
considered as a part of the code. Thus, when a jurisdiction adopts the IBC as its building code,  
it also adopts the standards identified in this chapter.  
Standards can be divided into several different categories—structural engineering  
standards, materials standards, installation standards, and testing standards. Developed by a  
consensus process, the standards referenced in the IBC are all identified in this chapter.  
Organized by the promulgating agency of the standard, the chapter provides the standard  
number, standard title, and the code section or sections where the standard is referenced in the  
IBC.  
Where one of the listed standards is referenced in the IBC, only the applicable portions of  
the standard relating to the specific code provision are in force. For example, Chapter 11  
references ICC A117.1 for the technical requirements relating to accessibility. The provisions  
of ICC A117.1 address accessible telephones; however, Chapter 11 does not require  
telephones to be accessible. Therefore, that portion of the standard is not considered as a part  
of the IBC, and accessible telephones are not required. Accessible telephones are regulated in  
Appendix E, so if the jurisdiction adopts the appendix chapter, the technical provisions of ICC  
A117.1 for telephones will be in force. As a reminder, Section 102.4.1 also indicates that  
where the provisions of the code and a standard are in conflict, the provisions of the code  
apply

jurisdiction adopting all, parts of, or none of the appendix chapters—depending on its needs  
for enforcement in any given area. The provisions of IBC Section 101.2.1 indicate that the  
requirements contained in the appendices are only applicable where specifically adopted by  
the jurisdiction. It is important that each jurisdiction reviews the appendix chapters in detail  
prior to their adoption to ensure their appropriateness  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Appendix A Employee Qualifications  
The provisions of this appendix are intended to assist the jurisdiction in qualifying individuals to  
be employed in key roles in a code compliance agency. Employee qualifications are provided for  
the position of building official as well as those for chief inspectors, inspectors, and plans  
examiners. An overview of the qualifications is shown in Table A-1.  
Table A-1 Employee qualifications.  
In addition to the education and experience criteria, an important consideration is the  
professional qualification obtained through certification. A comprehensive certification program  
is available through the International Code Council® \(ICC®\) that recognizes individuals for their  
knowledge relating to code enforcement.  
Appendix B Board of Appeals  
This appendix expands on the provisions of Section 113 relating to the board of appeals. Issues  
dealing with the filing of an appeal, the board membership, meeting notices, and board decisions  
are also addressed.  
This appendix specifies that the board consist of five individuals with appropriate experience  
and knowledge to make determinations in relation to the code. In addition, two alternate  
members should be appointed to serve in the absence or disqualification of a regular member.  
Board members shall not be employed by the jurisdiction or have an apparent conflict of interest  
in relation to the subject being appealed. As appropriate experience or training is needed to  
qualify for the board, members are often architects, engineers, and contractors.  
It is important that all hearings before the board are considered open meetings and are  
available to all interested parties. The appellant, the appellant’s representative or counsel, the  
building official, and all other persons who have an affected interest in the decision shall be  
permitted to address the board. In order to overturn or modify the decision of the building  
official, at least three members of the board must vote accordingly. Unless acceptable to the  
appellant, all five members must be present for the board to act on an appeal.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Appendix C Group U Agricultural Buildings  
The provisions of Appendix C were developed to address the needs of those jurisdictions  
\(primarily unincorporated county territory\) whose primary development is agricultural. In these  
cases, agricultural property usually consists of large tracts of land on which agricultural buildings  
are placed, usually with large open spaces and with essentially no congestion. Therefore, the  
provisions for agricultural buildings classify the structures as Group U occupancies and include  
barns, shade structures, grain silos, stables, and horticultural structures, as well as buildings used  
for livestock and poultry shelters, equipment and machinery storage, and milking operations.  
Because of the generally large open spaces that usually surround the buildings and the  
relatively low occupant load, the limitations imposed on construction, height, area, mixed uses,  
and exiting are generally more liberal than the requirements in the body of the code for Group F  
or S occupancies that would generally otherwise apply.  
Appendix D Fire Districts  
This appendix is available for adoption by jurisdictions wishing to establish fire districts. The use  
of fire districts provides a method to address fire hazards that are created by a variety of  
conditions, with the primary concerns based on occupancy and structure density. The provisions  
apply to new buildings built within the fire district, as well as those buildings undergoing  
alterations or a change of occupancy.  
It is necessary to first establish the territory that is to be included within the fire district. The  
code identifies three basic types of areas that are of importance in the regulation of fire districts.  
These include adjoining blocks, buffer zones, and developed blocks. The specifics of each of  
these areas are illustrated in Figure D-1.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationFigure D-1 Fire districts.  
@Seismicisolation @SeismicisolationThose buildings already existing when a fire district is established may not be increased in  
height or area unless in compliance with the code for new buildings. Any new construction must  
also be of a type permitted within the fire district. Alterations may not increase the level of fire  
hazard in the building, nor may the occupancy be changed to a classification that is not permitted  
in the fire district. Any buildings located partially in the fire district are to be regulated as if they  
are in the district, provided at least 50 percent of the structure lies within the district, or the  
building extends more than 10 feet \(3,048 mm\) inside the fire district’s boundaries.  
Section D105 identifies a number of types of uses and structures permitted within a fire  
district that might otherwise be excluded. The listed uses are all relatively minor in nature and do  
not pose a significant hazard to the fire-safety level that is mandated. Such uses include small  
private garages and sheds, fences, tanks and towers, small greenhouses, and wood decks. This  
section also permits a limited amount of alteration on dwellings of Type V construction.  
Appendix E Supplementary Accessibility Requirements  
This appendix addresses the design and construction of those accessible facilities not typically  
addressed by a building code. Although it is important that all reasonable efforts are made to  
make buildings accessible and usable, the body of the code in Chapter 11 contains only those  
requirements that directly relate to structures. Therefore, additional criteria are provided in this  
appendix to expand on the other accessibility features of the built environment.  
Many of the facilities regulated by this chapter involve furnishings or equipment. In Section  
E103.1, the code requires that an accessible route be provided to a raised platform used as a head  
table or speaker’s lectern. Section E104.2 regulates communication features in Group I-3  
occupancies and transient lodging facilities.  
Portable toilet and bathing rooms, laundry equipment, gaming machines, vending machines,  
mailboxes, automatic-teller machines, and fare machines are other possible features of a building  
that, through the regulation of this section, can be made more usable for individuals with  
physical disabilities. Telephones are fully addressed in Section E106, including provisions for  
wheelchair access, volume controls, and TTYs. Section E107.2 mandates that where permanent  
signage designates the use or description of a room or area, tactile identification, visual  
characters, and braille are also required. Directional and informational signs, as well as other  
special types of signage, are also addressed.  
Three of the other sections of this appendix regulate specific types of uses or buildings. Bus  
stops and bus shelters must be designed and constructed in a manner that makes them accessible.  
Fixed transportation facilities, such as stations for rapid rail, light rail, commuter rail, high-speed  
rail, and other fixed-guideway systems, must selectively have station entrances, signage, fare  
machines, platforms, TTYs, track crossings, public-address systems, and clocks that are  
accessible or usable. Some of these same features are regulated for airports as well.  
Appendix F Rodentproofing  
In an effort to reduce the possibility of rodents entering a building, this appendix sets forth  
construction methods to seal those potential entry points. The provisions apply not only to  
habitable and occupiable rooms but also to any spaces containing feed, food, or foodstuffs. The  
obvious intent is to prevent unsanitary conditions and the potential spread of disease that may  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationfollow.  
All openings in the foundation walls are to be covered or sealed in a prescribed manner to  
prevent the passage of rodents. Doors and windows are regulated when located adjacent to  
ground level. It is also the intent of this appendix that an apron or similar protective barrier be  
installed where the foundation wall is not continuous. The intent of this appendix is an attempt to  
eliminate all potential avenues for rodent entry that occur around the exterior of a building.  
Appendix G Flood-Resistant Construction  
Most jurisdictions in the United States have specific areas that are subject to flood conditions.  
This appendix is designed to reduce those losses, both public and private, that occur because of  
flooding. Administrative procedures and land-use limitations are set forth, intending to meet or  
exceed the regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program \(NFIP\). The importance of  
designating a floodplain administrator to enforce the floodplain management program is  
highlighted and several tasks for this administrator are laid out in the Appendix.  
The building-sciences provisions for flood-resistant design and construction are located in  
Section 1612. In conjunction with the provisions of this appendix, the regulations are consistent  
with the NFIP regulations.  
Appendix H Signs  
The design and installation of outdoor signs is regulated by this appendix. Signs can come in  
many shapes and sizes, and are used for many purposes. This appendix classifies signs based on  
their location such as ground signs, roof signs, wall signs, projecting signs, marquee signs, and  
portable signs. The types of signs, including internally illuminated signs, combustible signs, and  
animated devices, are also addressed.  
This appendix identifies the areas of concern when signs are placed on structures. It is  
important that any exit signs, fire escapes, or egress openings remain unobstructed. Required  
natural ventilation openings must also remain available. Signs must be able to withstand all  
imposed loads, including any wind or seismic loads that may be encountered. The combustibility  
of signs is also regulated, with specific provisions for plastic materials.  
Appendix I Patio Covers  
Applicable only to structures accessory to dwelling units, patio covers regulated by Appendix I  
are limited to one-story structures not exceeding 12 feet \(3,657 mm\) in height. Enclosure walls  
may have any configuration, provided the open area of the longer wall and one additional wall is  
equal to at least 65 percent of the area below a minimum of 6 feet, 8 inches \(2,032 mm\) of each  
wall, measured from the floor. Openings may be enclosed with insect screening, translucent or  
transparent plastic not more than ⅛ inch \(3.2 mm\) in thickness, or glass conforming to Chapter  
24.  
Patio covers may be detached or attached to the dwelling units, and shall be used only for  
recreational, outdoor living purposes and not as carports, garages, storage rooms, or habitable  
rooms. Any patio cover that falls outside the established scoping limits must be designed and  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconstructed to the standards set forth in the body of the IBC.  
Exterior openings required for light or ventilation may open into a patio structure conforming  
to this section. Where emergency egress or rescue openings from sleeping rooms lead to a patio  
structure, the structure shall be unenclosed. Where an exit from the dwelling unit passes through  
the patio structure, the structure shall be unenclosed or exits shall be provided in conformance  
with Chapter 10.  
Patio covers shall be designed and constructed to sustain the applicable snow loads or all dead  
loads plus a vertical live load of 10 pounds per square foot \(0.48 kN/m2\), whichever is greater.  
The minimum wind and seismic loads shall also be considered in the design.  
A patio cover may be supported on concrete slab on grade without footings, provided the slab  
is not less than 3½ inches \(89 mm\) thick, and further provided that the columns do not support  
live and dead loads in excess of 750 pounds \(3.34 kN\) per column.  
Appendix J Grading  
Not every jurisdiction is located in an area where the topography of the terrain requires extensive  
grading operations on private property. In those areas where developers need to grade private  
property, Appendix J provides appropriate administrative and technical regulations to assure the  
jurisdiction of reasonable safety against slope failure, landslides, and other soil failure hazards.  
Appendix K Administrative Provisions  
Appendix K is provided to allow those communities who adopt NFPA 70, the National  
Electrical Code® \(NEC®\), to include administrative provisions that will assist in their  
implementation and enforcement. These provisions assist in the administration of the NEC by  
providing administrative language that correlates with that of the International Codes®  
. In  
addition, the provisions established in Section K111 address technical issues that are additions or  
modifications to the requirements of the NEC.  
Appendix L Earthquake Recording Instrumentation  
Earthquake recording instrumentation measurements provide fundamental information needed to  
cost-effectively improve understanding of the seismic response and performance of buildings  
subjected to earthquake ground motions. The requirement only applies to newly constructed  
buildings of a specified size and located where the 1-second spectral response acceleration, S1, is  
greater than 0.40. Because the provision is in an appendix chapter, it is not mandatory unless  
specifically adopted by the jurisdiction.  
Appendix M Tsunami-Generated Flood Hazard  
The areas designated on State or ASCE Tsunami Design Zone Maps are most likely to suffer  
significant damage during a design tsunami event. Given the potentially serious life-safety risk  
presented to structures within these areas, the intent of the provisions in Appendix M is to limit  
the presence of high-hazard and high-occupancy structures \(Risk Categories III and IV\) within  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationthe designated Tsunami Design Zone. Buildings within the designated hazard zone are only  
permitted under certain conditions. A vertical evacuation tsunami refuge is permitted when  
constructed in accordance with FEMA P646 or where critical facilities are located within the  
hazard zone to fulfill their function, and they incorporate adequate structural and emergency  
evacuation features. Vertical evacuation is a central part of the National Tsunami Hazard  
Mitigation Program, driven by the fact that there are coastal communities along the West Coast  
of the United States that are vulnerable to tsunamis that could be generated within minutes of an  
earthquake on the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Vertical evacuation structures provide a means to  
create areas of refuge for communities in which evacuation out of the inundation zone is not  
feasible. The referenced FEMA guide includes information to assist in the planning and design  
of tsunami vertical evacuation structures. Because the provision is in an appendix chapter, it is  
not mandatory unless specifically adopted by the jurisdiction.  
Appendix N Replicable Buildings  
The concept of replicable building design applies where a given prototype is to be built in a  
variety of locations while maintaining consistent overall design parameters. The resulting  
replicable building is reviewed and deemed code compliant by a designated expert, allowing  
local jurisdictions to accept the structure as substantially code compliant. Such buildings could  
be approved for construction without a complete plan review, with the construction documents  
examined by the local authority for compliance with local amendments and conditions only.  
Appendix N establishes guidelines for replicable buildings that can give jurisdictions a tool they  
can adopt to help streamline the plan review process in regard to code compliance.  
The ICC Guideline for Replicable Buildings, ICC G1-2010, was published in 2010 to provide  
jurisdictions with guidance regarding the process of expedited plan review for replicable  
buildings. The Appendix N provisions, based on the G1-2010 guideline, are intended to benefit  
both owners and local jurisdictions by\:  
• Enhancing public safety through a more uniform review process,  
• Conserving local resources through the elimination of repetitive reviews of transportable  
plans, and  
• Reducing the time between permit submittal and construction mobilization.  
One of the major benefits of the International Codes \(I-Codes®\) is the establishment of  
consistent code provisions for states and local jurisdictions to enforce. Consistent enforcement is  
very important to national corporations and franchise chains that wish to construct similar or  
identical buildings across the country. The review process by an approved agency can greatly  
enhance the consistency of code application for replicable buildings and support consistent  
enforcement of the I-Codes while maintaining local jurisdictional authority.  
Implementing a building document review process to examine and verify the replicable  
construction documents comply with the current applicable I-Codes can save considerable state  
and local resources and time by eliminating repetitive code-compliance reviews. Local  
jurisdictions can then utilize their resources to focus on reviews of complex and high-risk  
projects. By coupling a global review of replicable documents with a local review of unique  
jurisdictional requirements that differ from the applicable I-Code, replicable buildings that utilize  
this optional regulatory review process can be constructed more cost effectively and with greater  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolationconsistency. Allowing owners, architects, builders, and engineers to submit a design, with its  
various facades and options, can also allow for more thorough plan examinations, reduced  
construction times, fewer in-field change orders, more meaningful inspections, and quicker  
occupancy of the finished building.  
The application of a replicable design is to be consistent in all of the fundamental code areas,  
such as fire- and life-safety, accessibility, structural stability, and energy efficiency, as well as  
plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems. The proposed design criteria as submitted must be  
reviewed by an approved individual or agency for every code discipline reviewed. Site-specific  
issues must be identified and approved, including variations from the replicable design, local  
requirements, and foundation design.  
Appendix O Performance-Based Application  
Performance-based design approaches are becoming more common in new and existing  
construction. Chapter 13 of the International Existing Building Code® \(IEBC®\) provides a  
performance-based approach that can be used for existing buildings while the ICC Performance  
Code® for Buildings and Facilities includes provisions for new and existing construction. Many  
building officials have found it difficult to determine what should be provided for review and  
whether the performance approach provided meets the intent of the IBC. This appendix outlines  
administrative provisions that can assist building officials in prescribing what is expected for  
permit applications that incorporate performance-based designs. These administrative provisions  
were extracted from the ICC Performance Code and have been provided in an easy-to-follow  
format.  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation METRIC CONVERSION TABLE  
Metric Units, System International \(SI\)  
Soft Metrication  
Hard Metrication  
# Metric Units, System International \(SI\)  
The most widely used system of units and measures around the world is the Systeme  
International d’Unites \(SI\), which is the modern form of the metric system. The other system of  
measurement is the U.S. Customary System Units, also known as “English Units,  
” consisting of  
the mile, foot, inch, gallon, second, and pound. Although the English system is gradually being  
replaced by the metric system in some sectors of U.S. industry, the full conversion of the U.S. to  
the metric system is still incomplete.  
Using metric units or providing metric equivalents is important because of the following  
reasons\:  
1\. Use of metric units facilitates understanding and communication in technical areas such  
as engineering, architecture, building codes, and other scientific areas at a global level.  
2\. Use of metric units is simpler because variations from smaller to larger units or vice  
versa are in multiples of 10, but in English units the multipliers could vary with unit and  
with subject. For example, smaller units of an inch are ½, ¼, ⅛, or 1/16 of an inch, each a  
multiplier of 2 larger than the other. Conversion of inches to feet is at a multiplier of 12  
and from feet to yards at a multiplier of 3. For metric, the smaller unit of a centimeter is  
a millimeter, which is a centimeter divided by 10. Conversion of centimeters to  
decimeters is by multiplying a centimeter by 10, and conversion of decimeters to meters  
is by multiplying by 10, and so on. Accordingly, computations and problem solving are  
prone to less error.  
The conversion to metric units can take two forms—soft metrication and hard metrication.  
# Soft Metrication  
Soft metrication is the use of metric units in specifying measurements, sizes, and other  
dimensions without changing product sizes and without changing the everyday practice of using  
English units. For example, a wood-stud member commonly used is a 2 × 4, which is actually  
1.5 inches × 3.5 inches. To report or to specify the actual size of this member in metric, a soft  
conversion of 38 mm × 89 mm is used \(rounded from actual 38.1 and 88.9\). Another example  
could be the load-bearing pressure of clay soils of 1,500 pounds per square foot being reported as  
72 kPa \(kilopascals\).  
@Seismicisolation @Seismicisolation Hard Metrication  
Hard metrication goes beyond soft metrication and converts production and manufacturing based  
on metric sizes. For example, instead of manufacturing 2 × 4 wood studs of 1.5 inches × 3.5  
inches \(38.1 mm × 88.9 mm, actual dimensions\), wood studs of 40 mm by 90 mm might be  
manufactured. Another example is ½-inch-diameter \(12.7-mm\) U.S. size automotive bolts versus  
13-mm metric bolts, which are manufactured with a diameter of 13 mm. The production of other  
structural or nonstructural members such as structural steel, plywood, nails, pipes, ducts,  
insulation panels, and all other such elements would also be done in metric rather than  
manufacturing in English units and reporting metric equivalents.

of Standards and Technology \(NIST\), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce\:
