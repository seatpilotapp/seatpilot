WHAT IS MICROCOPY  
AND WHAT’S IN  
THIS GUIDE How microcopy was born  
In 2009, Joshua Porter wrote a blog post with the title “Writing  
Microcopy” \(Bokardo blog\). In the post he described a checkout form  
he created for an e-commerce project, where 5%-10% of the online  
transactions were failing because of billing address errors, hence  
causing financial damage. What did Porter do? He added one sentence  
next to the billing address field\: “Be sure to enter the billing address  
associated with your credit card”.  
“And just like that, the errors went away", he wrote. "It was clear the right  
copy meant I didn’t have to worry about that problem anymore, thus saving  
support time and increasing revenue on the improved conversion.”  
Porter shared with his readers an idea that he had been mulling over for  
a while - just adding a few words in the right place at the right time  
could completely change the user experience. Not only that, he created  
the name for this type of copy\: microcopy.  
At a lecture he presented at the UXLX conference, he recounted that this post,  
which took less than 20 minutes to write, became a phenomenal success, the  
type of success bloggers dream about, and that he received many replies from  
UX readers thanking him for giving a name to these small but powerful words.  
Porter’s post was the first step in defining a new area of knowledge,  
microcopy \(also known as UX writing and UX copy\). This was a central  
element of the user experience that hadn’t received enough attention or  
benefitted from having a methodology to implement it. Since then, the  
definition of microcopy has been developed and refined, setting it off  
from content and copy. Following is the definition that I like best, and  
that was used to write this guide\:  
# Microcopy\: the definition  
The words or phrases in the user interface that are directly related  
to the actions a user takes\:  
• The motivation before the action  
• Instructions that accompany the action  
• The feedback after the user has taken the action  
Introduction | 9 The role of microcopy in the user experience  
For many years, the trend was to make the interface “clean”, with as  
few words as possible. Many people claimed that words overload the  
interface and are perceived as threatening by users. Others minimized  
the importance of words and asserted that no-one read them anyway.  
But the simple truth is that communication is based on words, and anyone  
who gives up on using them is removing a very basic component of the  
relationship between people. In other words, if you want to create a  
digital product that sounds human and relates to the people using it, you  
need words. At the end of the day, people are going to use your product,  
and there are some things that you can only convey to them by using words.  
This book contains a lot of them.  
# What can microcopy add to your digital product?  
1\. Create a positive experience and engage the user  
Microcopy reduces the alienation between people and machines, and  
changes the relationship from a robotic functional encounter to a  
human personal experience.  
Accurate microcopy adds a rich palette of colors to the experience you  
are trying to create, and adds depth to your product. Where needed,  
words will reach out to your users, and enable them to perform an  
action. Words engage users and can make them laugh or calm their fears.  
Good microcopy changes the connection between the product and its  
users into a mutual relationship, a conversation, that can be rich  
and even moving. Microcopy will create a dialog with your users that  
is full of character, such that it makes them want to work together  
with your product, and return another day. Microcopy can make your  
users fall in love.  
10 | Introduction 2\. Increase usability  
Microcopy greases the wheels of the interface and reduces friction  
with its users.  
Well written microcopy, appearing exactly where it is needed, will  
prevent problems in completing an action, and will save the user  
valuable time, frustration and a feeling of helplessness. A few small  
words that appear exactly where the user needs them will prevent a  
bad experience and unnecessary damage to their relationship with  
your brand.  
3\. Enhance branding and differentiation  
Microcopy written with a full understanding of your brand and target  
audience highlights the brand’s character and differentiates it from  
other brands.  
Instead of a boring and predictable product, one that your users  
encounter all over the internet, your product will be unique and full  
of personality. It will support your vision and the values of your  
brand, sharpen the key messages to your target audience, and create  
an authentic and unified experience throughout the whole interaction  
with your audience.  
The enormous potential of microcopy and the critical influence it has  
on the relationship between your brand and users, are becoming clearer  
to more and more user interface professionals. However, the subject is  
often overlooked during the design stages of the digital product. This  
is sometimes because of lack of time, lack of funds, or lack of awareness,  
and sometimes because the team just doesn’t know where to begin.  
The aim of this book is to give you the knowledge and tools to write  
microcopy; and no, you don’t need to be a copywriter. All you need appears  
in this guide.

# What’s in this book?  
The book Microcopy\: The Complete Guide provides a methodology for  
writing microcopy for websites and apps after designing the voice and  
tone of the brand. It provides insights, guidelines and practical tools  
that I have gathered over many years of writing microcopy for websites,  
apps, and other digital products for corporations, start-ups, and small  
businesses.  
It doesn’t matter if your website or app is already up and running, or if  
you are planning or upgrading it, this book will take you step by step  
through the entire process of creating microcopy.  
The first part of the book covers discovering the voice and tone of the  
brand, and what you need to decide before you actually go ahead and write  
the microcopy.  
The second part covers the power of microcopy to create engagement with  
your users and to provide a positive and rich experience.  
The third part of the book concentrates on the impact of microcopy on  
usability and also deals with accessibility and complex systems.  
12 | Introduction The 19 chapters of this book are written as practical guides with a  
method that you can immediately implement on your digital product. Each  
chapter starts with an understanding of the basic ideas and provides  
the steps required to implement them on all the elements of a UI. All  
the guidelines and tools are presented with the logic behind them, and  
the goal they are trying to achieve; and of course there are dozens of  
examples to learn from.  
# We are almost at the start line  
This book will change your digital experience, both as a user and as  
a person providing the experience. The verbal connection between the  
digital product and its users - the piece that completes the puzzle of  
the user experience - will forever capture your eyes and heart, and will  
be important and meaningful to you. And that’s a good thing. We spend  
a large part of our lives interacting with digital products, and it is  
only fitting that these valuable hours are spent in a pleasant way.  
Good luck on the journey and enjoy the read,  
Kinneret  
# Note about the copyright of examples used  
# in the book  
This book contains a lot of screenshots from within websites and apps.  
Naturally, the screenshots include elements covered by copyright, such as  
fonts, design and copy. Therefore, based on written legal advice, I have dealt  
with them with extreme caution. For instance, for each example I present  
only the minimum necessary to deliver the message. Wherever a screenshot  
was not essential, I have not provided it. Whenever websites or apps have  
provided the names of the designers, I have quoted this information.  
Despite this, if the book contains examples that their creators are  
not interested in having published here, please contact me at

Introduction | 13 PART 1  
PART 1\:  
THE VOICE AND TONE Things you need to know before  
# writing your first word  
Writers for digital products know well those first few moments before  
writing a title, call to action, or any other sentence that demands we  
step into the shoes of our users and speculate\: What will drive them?  
What exactly describes the value we are providing? And how can we prove  
to them that the best solution is our product or service? Then come  
the next set of questions\: How do we phrase it? Should we use humor?  
What about slang or maybe wit? Do we need to write formally? Do we  
stir someone’s emotions or rather try to calm them? Are we nostalgic  
or tech-y? Urban-cool or addressing the wide public?  
These considerations are very important and indeed necessary to  
ensure that every word we write is effective and does a good job. The  
thing is that instead of speculating each time afresh, we should know.  
The main messages you’ll impart to your users to motivate them to  
act and to connect to the brand, and also the voice and tone of what  
you write, should be defined beforehand. Luckily there is a method to  
achieve this.  
After reading the first three chapters of this book, and if, as a result,  
you make important decisions and follow them, you won’t need to  
speculate what will influence your users and the best way to phrase it.  
The answers will be clear and available whenever you need them.

VOICE AND  
TONE DESIGN  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
How language influences users  
What is voice and tone design and when to do it  
The complete step-by-step guide to designing  
voice and tone What do you mean when you say innovation?  
A large communications company, one of my earliest customers, stated  
that the main way they differentiate themselves from other companies  
in this very competitive field is with the digital innovation of their  
products, self-service options, and how they provide a relevant and  
personalized experience for their customers. Their approach is to think  
young, up-to-date, and one step ahead of everyone else.  
This message is emphasized at all board meetings, and they have  
documented it in the brand book and in their UX concept. They are  
focused on being leaders in their field and on bringing to market new  
innovative products. Like many other companies, they have invested  
a great deal in branding so that it broadcasts this important  
differentiation. They have designed a logo that matches their values,  
and they have created a high-end website and several apps. They paid  
a lot of attention to their choice of colors, fonts, and the many  
other elements that make up the user interface. They provide a user  
experience that makes their customers feel that the competitors are  
trailing far behind.  
They turned to me because they realized that their voice and tone, the  
words that appear on the various digital products, hadn’t been updated  
for the last 15 years. It had been left behind and they didn’t know how to  
update it so that it fitted their innovative approach.  
To get an idea of their current voice and tone and the microcopy used, I  
browsed the site and used some of the apps. As I do with all my customers  
in order to reveal their microcopy secrets, I registered on the site,  
completed self-service processes, recovered my password, made contact  
using their form, found their 404 page, and deliberately filled in each  
form with errors.  
I concluded that the customer was, once again, right. Their  
differentiation and sense of innovation were lacking continuity and  
quite confusing\:  
Voice and tone design | 17 • They declare themselves as innovative, but write in worn out clichés  
\(“Your inquiry is important to us” or “Your registration has been  
successfully completed”\).  
• They should persuade the user that signing up is simple and easy,  
but they sound like an insurance company \(“If it is your intent to  
register”\).  
• They want us to believe that their products are cutting-edge and  
relevant, but they use words that nowadays can only be found in  
dictionaries \(“Your search yielded the following results”\).  
• They want to evoke a young and dynamic feel, but they write like a robot  
\(“loading data, Please wait”\).  
• They try - oh, how they try - to motivate users to action, but forget to  
speak to their users’ strongest motivations.  
• And most important, they strive to be different, but sound just like  
everybody else.  
This is how I started one of the most fascinating voice and tone designs  
I have ever worked on. The change was so great that after a short while the  
competitors started a similar process, except the company I was working for  
could back up its assertions - it was again one step ahead of everyone else.  
# Voice and tone in digital products - the human  
# connection  
The Man Who Lied to His Laptop is the name of a book written by  
Professor Clifford Nass of Stanford University, together with Corina  
Yen. Professor Nass was one of the leading researchers in the field of  
interaction between humans and computers, and in this book he and Yen  
summarize 100 experiments where he researched this interaction.  
He found that people treat their computers according to social norms we  
apply when communicating with other human beings. Research proves again  
and again that we respond to computers and digital interfaces as if they  
were human. We are polite to them and expect them to respond politely, such  
as praising us if we manage to complete a task. In fact, if the computer  
provides warm and positive feedback, shows emotion that we relate to as  
18 | Voice and tone design authentic, or behaves in a similar fashion to us, we’ll be more productive  
in the tasks it asks us to do, we’ll agree to more of its requests, and will  
believe more of what it is telling us. And conversely, if the product does  
not conform to our social conventions, and does not behave in the expected  
way, we are liable to get angry, disappointed, and even offended.  
What’s happening here? Before the digital age, the only entities that used  
language to communicate were humans. Thus, when someone addresses us using  
language, our brain immediately responds to the other party as a human.  
Language is therefore the main factor that makes digital products  
more human-like, it endears them to users and creates an emotional  
connection that motivates us to act. But for this to happen, the product  
needs to conform to social conventions and feel natural and authentic.  
# Users' trust hinges on your voice and tone  
Professor Nass researched how humans relate to digital products that  
present an inconsistent personality, especially where there are non-  
verbal elements \(such as tone of voice\) that are not consistent with  
the verbal elements \(such as the content\). He found that users related  
to the product as if it were unauthentic and unworthy of their trust.  
The story that this personality presented did not manage to persuade  
the users or evoke any emotion. On the contrary, the product sowed  
confusion and suspicion.  
On the other hand, when the verbal and non-verbal elements were  
consistent and supported each other, the users felt that the personality  
was intelligent, fun and persuasive. They also understood the messages  
better, had an emotional reaction to them and were influenced by them.  
The more the users trusted the personality communicating with them,  
and believed that it was authentic, the more they were persuaded by its  
messages and agreed to act accordingly.  
Nass explained that the reason we react in this way is because we try  
to create a coherent picture of the personality communicating with  
us. If we cannot create such a picture, we become suspicious and feel  
a sense of rejection.  
Voice and tone design | 19 That’s what was happening in the example that opened this chapter\: The  
product reflected innovation in its non-verbal elements, but the language  
was outdated; the product was dynamic but the language was heavy; the  
product was simple and clear but the language was cumbersome; thus, users  
lost trust, understood less and were less persuaded by the messages.  
# How voice and tone design solves the problem  
Voice and tone design defines the language the brand will use when  
communicating with its users across all its digital products. This  
voice and tone design keeps the language the brand uses in line with  
its core values and supports them, so as not to create dissonance and  
unreliability.  
Voice and tone design defines the language in two main ways\:  
1\. Personality  
What characteristics do you wish to convey to users with your language?  
What is the right tone, degree of formality, degree of humor \(if any\), use  
\(or non-use\) of slang, pace of speech, warmth, friendliness, etc.?  
2\. Messaging  
What are the main messages? What will you highlight to get them to act?  
What should you say so that they feel good about themselves and your  
brand? And finally, what can you say to create a desired relationship  
that benefits you both?  
After you have defined your brand’s voice and tone, and you actually use  
it in your written materials\:  
• Every word you write will be deliberately chosen, focused and  
influential.  
• Your target audience will easily understand the value of your offering  
and the need it fulfills for them.  
• The call to action will be simple and more effective.  
• The brand will be more relatable and will come across as credible  
and compelling.  
20 | Voice and tone design Example\: How character sounds like  
If we ask two people to state the same message in their own words,  
we’ll receive two different versions. If we ask five people, we’ll get  
five versions. We each have our own character, unique way of thinking,  
different experiences that shaped us, and distinctive goals in life.  
Therefore even if we talk the same language, what any one of us says  
will be in a slightly different tone.  
For example\: two different American e-commerce sites ask their users  
to provide their date of birth when signing up, and each provides the  
reason they need this information - because it’s required by law.  
Famous and serious Nike says this\:  
www.nike.com  
Whereas J. Peterman, that sells unique vintage products from all over the  
world \(and Elaine's boss on Seinfeld\), puts it this way\:  
www.jpeterman.com  
Exactly the same message \(we are required by law\) is written by two  
different brands, each with its own unique character, thus the voice  
and tone used differs. If J. Peterman had used Nike’s voice and tone,  
they would have spoilt the warm and intimate atmosphere that they  
have created with every word and in every nook and cranny of their  
delightful site. Whereas if Nike used J. Peterman’s voice and tone,  
they would harm the image they try to create as a company that takes  
itself very seriously.  
Each of these brands has a different relationship with its users\:  
J. Peterman tries \(and succeeds\) in creating a warm, very service-  
oriented relationship with its customers, the type you might have  
Voice and tone design | 21 between a seller and regular customer in the neighborhood second-  
hand shop. On the other hand, the relationship created on the Nike  
site can be seen as being between a corporation that plays in the big  
leagues and potential customers who dream of getting there too. The  
voice and tone of each brand supports these different relationships.  
# 7 stages in the lifecycle of a brand  
# when it is worthwhile to stop and  
# design a voice and tone  
As with all things connected to branding, voice and tone design follows the  
rule of the sooner the better. The earlier you define the voice and tone, the  
more consistent your texts will be, and the verbal elements of your digital  
products won't look like patchwork. On the other hand, it is never too late\:  
a change of voice and tone can result in an improvement to the bottom line,  
and that is always a good thing, isn’t it.  
Following are 7 critical stages where I recommend designing a voice and  
tone, if you haven’t yet designed it\:  
• Creating a new brand - together with the visual branding, before the first  
word is even written. If you design the voice and tone right up front,  
you will benefit from a brand that communicates in a uniform way, and is  
persuasive from the word go. You’ll also get used to communicating in the  
brand’s voice and tone, and won’t need to overcome bad habits.  
• Releasing of a new or upgraded product.  
• Sharpening your brand’s differentiation.  
• Setting up a new digital campaign.  
• Creating or upgrading the organization’s written communication  
infrastructure \(email, chat, and social media\).  
• Before entering a new market with a new target audience.  
• If you understand that the words you currently use simply don’t work.  
22 | Voice and tone design The guide\: How to design a full  
# and effective voice and tone  
Voice and tone design is a short process where you fully and accurately  
define the personality of the brand and the messages that will influence  
its target audience. You can do this in-house or with the help of external  
content and branding experts. The whole process should take 1-3 weeks.  
The end product of this process is a written voice and tone design that  
enables you to write microcopy \(you can also use it when writing copy,  
content, status updates in the social media, and anything else written  
on behalf of your brand\).  
For medium and large companies and for freelancers that write microcopy  
for these companies, the full process includes 4 stages, and at every  
stage you’ll discover important insights. If you lack the time or budget,  
or if you own a small business or a blog, stages 2 and 3 are the ones you  
should definitely do. In the following pages you’ll discover exactly how  
to accomplish each stage and where you get the required information.  
Stage 1 - Get to know the brand  
Read the existing design and branding documents, and extract essential  
information. Some documents you can read at this stage\:  
1\. Company vision, mission and values  
2\. Brand book \(and any other branding documentation you can lay your hand on\)  
3\. Briefs that were made for designers or for advertising purposes  
4\. Presentations made for introducing the business  
5\. UX concept and personas made for it  
6\. Research on brand perception and customer satisfaction  
Stage 2 - Listen to what your users say  
Extract good quotes, authentic phrases, words that repeat themselves,  
and what users see as motivators and setbacks. For a list of resources,  
see tip 5 on page 39.  
Voice and tone design | 23 Stage 3 - Complete the story with updated information fresh from the field  
Hold a structured group interview with the organization’s key  
personnel \(marketing manager, digital manager, service and sales  
senior reps, and sometimes advertising people\). In small businesses  
this is probably you, and you can hold this session with team members,  
a strategic consultant, or a close friend whose advice you appreciate.  
In this session, ask a series of questions about the brand and its  
target audience. All the questions are provided further along in this  
chapter \(see page 50\).  
This interview usually lasts about 3 hours, and sometimes you'll  
need two, 2-hour sessions\: the first will be about the brand \(with the  
marketing team\), and the second about the users \(with the service and  
sales teams\). By the end of the meeting you should have a rich, detailed  
portrayal of the brand's personality and its target audience.  
It is highly recommended to make this a group interview, as opposed to  
conducting several one-on-one interviews, so that conflicting views are  
immediately resolved.  
Stage 4 - Put all the pieces together and produce the document  
This is basically a working document that organizes and brings together  
all the information you had gathered in the previous steps, used from now  
on to guide the actual writing. What does it look like? See page 48 for  
directions.  
The following pages provide a practical handbook to designing your  
voice and tone. The more questions you answer or information you  
gather, the more consistent, rich, precise and effective your voice and  
tone will be.  
24 | Voice and tone design The first part of voice and tone design\:  
# The brand  
# 1\. Define the vision and mission  
The change the brand wants to promote and the way this should  
be achieved  
Usually we don’t explicitly tell our users the vision and mission, but  
everything we write should implicitly reflect and promote them. Thus,  
it is important that the vision and mission are clear and familiar to  
all the writers.  
Defining the vision might sound like a simple task \(it seems obvious  
why the brand was created, doesn’t it?\), but in my experience it is often  
complicated and confusing. Invest as much time as required to define  
this and don’t cut corners. The effort will be worth it.  
See page 50 for the list of questions used to identify the vision and  
mission.  
# TIP  
# 01  
# Ask why  
The best way to reveal the vision is to ask the brand’s key  
personnel why it was created. For every answer they provide,  
make it hard on them and keep asking why. After a few rounds of  
why, you’ll get to the heart of the matter. For example\:  
Why was the microcopy studio, Nemala, created? In order to  
write better microcopy and teach others how to do it.  
Why? So that digital products will provide a more pleasant  
and human experience.  
Why? Because people spend most of their day in front of these  
digital products and if our experience is warmer and more  
pleasant, our lives will get better.  
Nemala’s vision\: To create a human, bonding and heartwarming  
digital experience for people and improve their lives.

# TIP  
# Search the attic  
The vision and mission are usually defined at an early stage  
of setting up the organization. It’s probable that they have  
# 02  
been phrased and documented in the brand book, UX concept  
guide, the elevator pitch, in presentations to investors,  
and in other foundation documents. Find them there, make  
sure you still hold them to be true, or change them.  
26 | Voice and tone design 2\. Define values  
Ideals and principles that guide the brand’s actions  
Select the 5 most important values that the brand cannot do without. If  
you're not sure what "values" are, take a look at the list on page 29.  
For each value, write 1-3 line description and then ask\: how does this  
value sound? What kind of language will convey this value? For example,  
if one of your values is Leadership, you might want your language to  
be charismatic, sharp, and recruiting. Address the users directly, and  
convey a clear vision in your messaging.  
If Community is important to you, use inclusive, connecting language,  
with warm tones and soft humor, and with messages of sharing and caring.  
This way, the values will be explicitly expressed, creating a coherent  
personality.  
# TIP  
# 03  
# Prepare your word toolboxes  
Every characteristic and value can be described using  
words, expressions and phrases that are connected to them  
or carry relevant meaning. Prepare a toolbox of words that  
you can pull out whenever you need to express a certain  
value. Use a thesaurus and also collect the terms you have  
heard directly from your users \(more on that later\).  
For example, here is the toolbox of words for the value  
“practicality” for the voice and tone of an academic  
institution\:  
Relevant, entrepreneurial, daily, tools, management,  
practice, platform, changing / dynamic reality, advantage,  
decision making, real time, toolbox, applicable, practical,  
flexible, apply what I have studied, wages, the job market,  
career, employment, employers, graduates, post graduate, a  
set of tools that will help me.

Voice and tone design | 29 3\. Describe the personality  
If the brand was a person, it would…  
Imagine that your brand is a person \(yes, yes, just imagine for a minute…\),  
then write down their personality traits\: the way they behave around  
others, their sense of humor \(or indeed if they have a sense of humor\),  
and so on. Even describe the way they dress, their hobbies, personal  
preferences, anything that will help you characterize their personality,  
and from it - the way they talk. To make it much easier and fun go to the  
list of questions on page 50.  
Note that the brand's personality is not your user's personality, and  
indeed might be very different, depending on the relationship you wish  
to conduct with your users \(see also page 46\).  
# TIP  
# 04  
# Where are you on the scale  
In addition to using the personality questionnaire \(on page  
50\), I usually use this characterization tool developed by  
Pamela Wilson from Big Brand System. Ask your brand’s key  
personnel to rate the brand’s personality on the following  
6 scales. Sometimes their answers are surprising and  
insightful.  
Personable and  
friendly  
Corporate,  
professional  
Spontaneous,  
High energy  
Careful thinking,  
planning  
Modern  
or hi-tech  
Classic and  
traditional  
Cutting edge  
Established  
Fun  
Serious  
Accessible to all  
Upscale  
30 | Voice and tone design Example\: a charismatic mom  
During the three hours over coffee that I spent with a sleep consultant to  
design her voice and tone, she told me a lot about her target audience -  
first time moms. These young mothers are exposed to a constant stream of  
information that makes them feel insecure in their own intuitions and in  
their ability to understand the child and know what’s best for him or her.  
Based on this description, we constructed together the brand’s personality\:  
If the sleep consultant brand was a person, she would be a 35-year old woman,  
a mother, and she would wear comfortable but fashionable clothes. She would  
read the Parenting and Health section of the newspaper first, and would spend  
the limited free time she has in DIY projects, running, and socializing. She is  
generous and devoted, attentive and empathic, but authoritative and precise.  
She’s funny and happy, and radiates that nothing is really catastrophic. She  
has abundant knowledge, but she listens instead of preaching, and respects  
rather than patronizes. She combines authenticity and sincerity with  
professionalism and experience - and that creates trust. Her formal knowledge  
is plentiful and up-to-date, but she also respects a mother’s intuition.  
How is this personality reflected in the voice and tone?  
• Despite the anxiety that surrounds the subject, it is important not to  
fall into the trap of sounding too serious; on the contrary, add humor and  
keep it light and natural.  
• Keep the professional material flowing, conversational and authentic.  
Don’t let the style become know-all and preaching on what’s allowed  
or forbidden. The voice and tone should generate a good experience,  
encourage curiosity and also challenge the mother.  
• Generosity and devotion are conveyed by presenting organized lists  
of everything the mother receives at each meeting and during the whole  
counseling process. Thus she can easily see the wealth of help provided.  
• To express attentiveness and respect, the new mother should be the focus  
of the texts.  
• On the scale between friendly and professional, the personality is bang  
in the middle\: she’ll talk to the mother as an equal, but she won’t be her  
best friend.  
Voice and tone design | 31 Humor in your microcopy\:  
A common misconception about microcopy is that if we want to sound human,  
being funny will do the trick. This approach has brought up quite a few cases  
of “trying too hard” microcopy. In these cases, we feel like the writers were  
trying so hard to be Joe Cool that they forgot they were writing for UX. So  
what’s the right way to use humor in your microcopy?  
1\. Only if it fits your personality  
Is your brand or product deliberately designed as cool or funny? Why? What  
in its vision or values backs that up? Humor, sarcasm and wit can support your  
branding and strengthen the relationship with your users, but it can also  
damage them. For example, if your brand is supposed to promote the value of  
sharing, sarcasm may drive away users looking for a connection. So, before  
writing cool copy, let your brand values dictate why and how.  
However, it’s important to be careful when making assumptions up front.  
For example, if your app monitors the diet of diabetics, you might think it  
should sound very serious, because it affects the quality of life of many  
people. But you shouldn’t take this for granted just because “health matters  
are serious”. You can also choose to make the app humorous, to explicitly  
help your users get through their challenging day with a smile.  
2\. Only the way best suited for the target audience  
Will your target audience understand you? Does your choice of humorous  
language connect to your users’ culture and age group? True, there will  
always be users annoyed by the slightest mention of fun. Still, you  
have to know enough about your core users to know what shade of humor  
is relevant for them. For example, people under the age of 17 use a  
unique vocabulary when being funny. When you’re writing for kids or  
teenagers, it’s important to have a “translator” from that age group  
look over your copy and see if it sounds authentic \(unless you’re 17\).  
Same goes for writing for any other culture or dialect that isn’t your  
native tongue.  
32 | Voice and tone design 7 guidelines to doing it right  
3\. Make sure wit isn’t your writing’s only characteristic  
If the only thing you can say about a writing style is that it’s witty, then  
it’s probably flat. Microcopy can also be nostalgic, energetic, warm, modest,  
arrogant, relaxed, poetic, sharp, sentimental, hippie and so much more,  
it all depends on your brand’s values. If your microcopy doesn’t convey  
anything other than wit, it means something has gone wrong.  
4\. How much is too much?  
Did you make them laugh at the beginning and end? You don’t have to be funny  
in the middle. Does your message close with a punchline? Start it off with  
a simple sentence letting users know what’s happening. If possible, write  
the entire flow as a coherent sequence, instead of considering each screen  
separately; this will help you disperse your precious humor and wit with  
a gentle hand. Ultimately, choosing the right dosage of humor is the name  
of the game. And as Google say in their voice and tone design\: If you have a  
unicorn in the forest, you don’t need a hula hooping monkey too.  
5\. Nothing comes at the expense of clarity. Ever.  
If your users have to pause and read your microcopy again to understand  
it, that’s a bad sign. Usability rules. Humor can be a great sidekick to  
microcopy’s other qualities \(concise, clear, helpful\), but never a substitute.  
6\. Be sensitive to the situation  
Uh oh, your system crushed. We don’t have the foggiest why. If your work is  
not saved, oops, it’s all gone forever! But hey, there are kids in Africa who  
don’t even have internet!  
7\. Be mindful of how frequently users see each joke  
When writers enjoy their own jokes too much, they run the risk of using  
humor in texts frequently seen by the user. This isn’t ideal, because it will  
get boring fast; by the third time your user sees your joke, it’s probably  
not funny anymore.  
Voice and tone design | 33 The second part of voice and tone  
# design\: The target audience  
# 1\. Define the demographics  
The demographic characteristics of the target audience\: who  
will your brand be talking to?  
With young people you can use contemporary language and slang, whereas  
seniors might not follow you. Youngsters also usually need fewer  
explanations on how to use the interface, whereas with older people you  
need to provide more instructions, but this too is changing fast and has  
to be reexamined for each case.  
If your audience is of a specific age and style of living, you can spice  
up your microcopy with quotes from popular television shows, while  
other groups might not understand where you’re coming from. There are  
audiences that will enjoy and be flattered when you address them in a  
sophisticated and witty way, yet other audiences will be offended, feel  
left out, or lose patience altogether.  
So you see, it is extremely important to understand who you are  
addressing. The main characteristics you need to define are\:  
• Age  
• Gender  
• Where they live  
• Level of education  
• Marital status  
• Other areas of interest  
• Technological inclination  
Of course, any other information you gather about your target audience  
will also help in designing the voice and tone.  
34 | Voice and tone design Is everyone your target audience?  
Some brands have a wide target audience that covers a large part of  
the population \(such as banks or Waze\), or relatively large \(such as  
Starbucks\), whereas others have a distinct and easy to define target  
audience \(such as Snap\).  
The more defined the target audience, the more the voice and tone can  
and must take on a specific style that suits it. On the other hand, if  
your target audience is wide-ranging, the voice and tone will be more  
conservative and less sophisticated so as to meet everyone’s needs.  
That doesn’t necessarily mean the voice and tone has to be boring or  
lack a distinctive personality. It still needs to be well defined,  
rich, welcoming, and fit the general persona you have defined.  
A good example of a brand that addresses a very wide audience but  
still has a clear personality, is Ikea. It uses a voice and tone that is  
very simple, unsophisticated, not particularly humorous, sometimes  
even banal; but it displays a consistent and pleasant personality,  
provides a warm and homely atmosphere, and has a practical tone with  
conservative messages that nearly everyone can find appealing. For  
example\:  
“The perfect compromise - he wants a sofa with a high level of  
fi rmness, you want a sofa you can sink into. With this sofa you  
combine both and live happily ever after”.  
Voice and tone design | 35 2\. Define the needs and problems of your target  
# audience  
The practical challenges and emotional worries felt by your  
users - in their own words  
Every product or service should improve the user’s life, make it easier,  
answer a need or solve a problem. The better you understand the problem  
that the product or service is solving, and its influence on the lives of  
its users, the easier it is to more precisely address their motivations  
in the various messages, calls to action, and instructions.  
# Is your target audience made up of several -  
# very different - groups?  
Let’s say you run a marketplace for second-hand goods. On the one hand you  
write for people that want to sell their items, and on the other for those  
who are looking to buy new-used items. Or\: you have a cellular company  
that offers different digital products to teenagers and families.  
In the next few pages we’ll ask questions about the target audience, like\:  
what are their needs, hopes, and objections, and what is the nature of the  
relationship we would like to have with them. It’s obvious that for each of  
these distinct target audiences - buyers and sellers, youths and families  
- you will come up with completely different answers to these questions.  
What should you do then? Find the distinct answers given by each  
group, and come up with a separate messaging array for each. If you  
are preparing a voice and tone design for a large organization, you  
might need to confer with different sales and service teams that work  
with the different groups.  
At the end of the day, the brand characteristics from the first part of  
the voice and tone design will remain the same for all target audiences,  
with minor fine-tuning at most, but the messaging will be completely  
different according to what you’ll find out in the second stage.  
36 | Voice and tone design You will also find it easier to gain the trust of your audience, and show  
them that you listen to them, understand them, and that you offer the best  
solution to their problem or need.  
Let me emphasize that this is not manipulation\: Your product or service will  
not succeed if it doesn’t provide real value to your users and solve their  
problems. The real challenge is to accurately pinpoint these problems, and  
describe them with your users’ words to motivate them to choose your solution.  
# Example\: how we made it \(a bit\) easier for job  
# seekers during a challenging period of their lives  
Looking for a job is a sensitive and especially painful process, as it  
touches a basic, existential and urgent need\: our livelihood. In the  
interviews conducted with job seekers, which I listened to when writing  
microcopy for an online job board, I heard a long list of difficulties  
and hardships that they endured during this period. Following is just  
some of the input, and I’ll show how it influenced the voice and tone and  
how that affected the relationship created between the job board and  
its users.  
Hardship Influence on the voice and tone  
The average period someone  
looks for a job is 60 days,  
and during this time the  
job seekers provide their  
details and upload their  
resumes on dozens of sites  
and for many positions.  
We’re talking about a daily  
disheartening task that  
seems interminable.  
Wherever possible, we explained to the  
users why we need them to provide a  
certain piece of information or to fill  
out a form. We described the benefit  
to them, and reminded them that this  
action would bring them one step closer  
to their goal, making it a little less  
discouraging. But we were careful not to  
be repetitive - job seekers encounter  
many such forms every day. Our voice  
and tone was brief, professional and  
straightforward, with many active verbs  
demonstrating progression and speed.  
Voice and tone design | 37 Hardship Job seekers rightly feel  
that thousands of other  
applicants are applying for  
the same job, and that it is  
nearly impossible to stand  
out from the crowd and catch  
the eye of the potential  
employer. And this is quite  
depressing.  
Loneliness is one of the  
strongest feelings that  
job seekers experience.  
Alone, they have to face  
one of the hardest periods  
in their lives while  
everyone else continues  
with their daily routine.  
In usability testing, it  
was found that because  
job seekers usually don’t  
receive a reply from  
employers, they are not  
sure if the form they  
filled on a job board was  
actually sent, and if sent,  
was it with all the right  
attachments, and was it  
received by the employer.  
38 | Voice and tone design  
Influence on the voice and tone  
This fear of being swallowed up by the  
crowd, was used by us to motivate users  
to add a cover letter to their resume.  
We wanted them to add a cover letter as  
employers respond to these much more,  
so it was in their best interests to  
provide it; but often they would skip  
this because they lacked patience, were  
disheartened or simply lazy. So just  
before the cover letter form, we spoke  
directly to their hardship and reminded  
them that a cover letter is a good way to  
stand out from other applicants.  
To relieve the loneliness, it was  
important to us to provide a very human  
product, supportive and understanding.  
We used a conversational and soft voice  
and tone, we reflected feelings and  
concerns, and showed a lot of empathy in  
our texts.  
In order to address these concerns, we added  
clear unambiguous feedback throughout the  
process that it was proceeding well - that  
the form had been successfully received,  
that the resume was sent to the employer,  
that the current stage of the process had  
finished successfully, and so on. TIP  
# 05  
# Users are the best copywriters  
When you are expressing what your users think, it is best to  
use their words. They will always be more precise and use  
the most authentic phrases. Take the words of your users,  
and use them to describe the benefits of your brand and to  
get users to act.  
Where can you hear what your users say?  
1\. Online chat transcripts  
2\. Answers to open questions in surveys you conducted  
3\. Online communities \(e.g., Facebook groups\) about relevant  
matters  
4\. Feedback/comments made about your brand or your  
competitors on social media  
5\. Usability tests recordings  
6\. Listening to call centers' incoming and outgoing calls  
7\. Transcripts from focus groups  
8\. Any other platform your target audience uses to discuss  
relevant issues  
Lacking any of these resources? Interview 5-10 of your  
potential users, even from your friends and family. It  
only takes a few hours and it can entirely change the way  
you think, and write, about your brand and product.  
What will you find? Treasure. You’ll find excellent,  
precise wording that you would never find on your own when  
analyzing in a professional, planned and rational manner.  
Simply take your users’ words and embed them in your copy.  
Voice and tone design | 39 3\. Describe the hopes and dreams of your  
# target audience  
Their purpose in using your digital product  
In the previous section we looked at what negative things would be  
solved by using your digital product. This section looks at the positive  
outcomes, what the users gain from using it. People need a good reason to  
act, they need to believe that the action will bring them closer to their  
goals, and will make their dreams and hopes come true. These hopes are  
the reason that they got to your product, and they will be the drivers to  
sign up, share, buy an item, or do anything else you want them to do on  
your product. Therefore, these hopes and dreams are what you’ll talk about  
when you want the users to do something or when you want to give them the  
feeling that they are in the right place and doing the best thing for them.  
And for that to happen you need to know the users’ words to hit the right  
spot \(see tip 05\).  
# Example\: let’s talk for a minute about  
# your budget  
When a big bank uploaded to its website a new tool to manage a customer’s  
budget, it was easy for me to connect to the hopes and dreams of the target  
audience\: while I regularly keep an eye on my bank account, I’d still love  
something simple and efficient that will give me an overview of my budget,  
and show me where I spend more, and where less. This tool might help me  
finally achieve some of those goals I’ve put on ice because I haven’t had  
the time to arrange a budget for them \(such as to finally travel and see  
the northern lights\).  
As part of the voice and tone design for this new tool, we learned about  
the hopes and dreams of the bank’s customers concerning their budget.  
We discovered three key groups of aspirations\: 1. Peace of mind and long  
term financial security, realized by putting money aside; 2. Control,  
by tracking and understanding the big picture; 3. Quality of life and  
40 | Voice and tone design realizing dreams, realized by careful planning of the budget and by  
accumulating savings.  
Now we just had to show the users how this budget management tool would  
move them closer to achieving these aspirations\:  
• When we wanted to motivate customers to check out and use the tool, we  
spoke about peace of mind, security, and realizing dreams\: “So that you  
can realize a new or old dream and be prepared for anything life puts  
in your path”.  
• So that users would set themselves objectives in the various expense  
categories, we spoke about being in control\: “Keep your fi nger on the  
pulse and at any point in time see where you stand in relation to your  
life goals".  
• The need for control and being informed was also used as a motivator  
to get users to correctly categorize each expense\: “A good budget is  
an accurate budget - expenses that you don't categorize stop you from  
seeing the big picture”.  
• So that they would use the follow up and comparison tools, we spoke  
about achieving goals\: “To plan forward and achieve goals, you need to  
also look back. Here you can see your budget over the whole year”.  
As you can see, you don’t need to rack your brains to find the phrases or  
messages that will motivate your users to act. They visited your website  
or app to achieve something that would improve their lives. You just need  
to find out what that is and remind them of it.  
Voice and tone design | 41 4\. Define the objections and concerns of your  
# target audience  
The barriers that will stop users from actually using your  
product or service  
Objections need special attention, and on no account should they be  
ignored. On the contrary, you need to address them, at least implicitly,  
dispel them or prevent them from occurring in the first place. There are  
some well-known and constant objections, such as reluctance to spend  
money or provide personal details; and then there are those unique to a  
specific product or service. Either way, map out and fully understand the  
objections and concerns, and provide your users with compelling reasons  
so that they overcome them and trust you.  
# Example\: will you marry me?  
We all have a clear picture of what a classic marriage proposal looks  
like, drummed into us after watching thousands of hours of romantic  
dramas\: one man, one woman and a diamond ring. The man on bended knee, the  
woman weeping with joy, and the ring’s a perfect fit. A photo of the ring is  
uploaded to Facebook and they live happily ever after.  
A large and well established diamond company decided to challenge its  
traditional business and put up a website focused entirely on engagement  
rings. The target audience is male - those selecting the ring, not those  
who will wear it. On the website the men are offered an extensive catalog  
with a large selection of designs to choose from, and then they can select  
a diamond according to their budget. In this way anyone can create online  
the exact ring they want that also fits their budget.  
A man selecting a ring and diamond - usually for the first time in his  
life - has many concerns, but only one dream\: a fairy tale marriage  
proposal and one happy and very satisfied woman. True, the sky won’t  
fall if his fiancée wants to change the ring or alter its size, but that  
42 | Voice and tone design will be an unromantic twist in an otherwise glittering picture. So some  
of the man’s concerns are about his girlfriend\: can he find something to  
suit her taste? How does he know the correct size? Other fears concern  
the diamond\: based on what criteria does he select the diamond? What  
does he need to examine and question? How does he know that the diamond  
is genuine and of high quality? And the biggest concern of all\: what  
will he do with the ring if she surprises him and says no… On top of all  
that there are the usual concerns of buying online\: security, shipment  
or pick-up options, and so on.  
Any one of these concerns is enough to cause the user to abandon the  
online process and look at another site, or go to a brick-and-mortar  
shop. But this company really studied its target audience, and in its  
online selecting and purchasing processes it provides clear reference  
to each one of these concerns. Before selecting a ring, the site offers  
links to short articles that suggest to the user that he take a look  
at his girlfriend’s jewelry box, see what other rings she has bought  
herself, and measure the diameter of her favorite ring. Later on there is  
a promise by the company to change the size if necessary, with no extra  
charge. Every technical term, such as color or clarity, is accompanied by  
an explanation and illustration. There are references to the certificate  
of authenticity and assurance that comes with the ring; and towards the  
end of the process the security of the site is emphasized, and a full  
refund is promised if the ring is returned within 30 days.  
Preparation of an organized list of objections and concerns, and the  
provision of a solution at exactly the right moment, enables a user to finish  
the process of selection and purchase of an item smoothly and with peace of  
mind, without abandoning the site or turning to support. It’s better for  
both the user and the website operators.  
Voice and tone design | 43 5\. Make a list of the preferences of your  
# target audience  
The main reasons that your target audience will choose your  
brand and not that of your competitors or similar brands  
What differentiates your brand and makes it better than others? In  
professional terms it’s called “competitive advantages”, and you should  
flood those messages on the website and highlight them.  
# TIP  
# 06  
# Put your users in the center  
Keep in mind not to write about the brand’s advantages, but  
rather the advantages important to your target audience.  
For example, if you use an emerging technology, that in  
itself does not interest your target audience, it does not  
provide a competitive advantage, and there is no point  
writing about it. But if this technology enables your users  
to do things they couldn’t do previously anywhere else,  
then that’s the bit that interests them. They don’t care  
how you do things behind the scenes to get their desired  
result, it is the result itself that is important.  
A competitive advantage is only a real advantage if it  
provides your target audience with a distinct benefit that  
your competitors cannot provide them. So focus on what  
interests your target audience, not what interests you.  
44 | Voice and tone design Example\: Israel’s Harvard  
Israel has nine universities and about 50 colleges of higher education. Thus,  
when one of the leading academic institutions decided to upload a new website,  
brand differentiation was the key challenge. Naturally, the voice and tone  
needed to meet the challange, as did all the other elements of the site.  
During the voice and tone design, the college admissions advisor described  
to me the mood of candidates when they access the site\: On the one hand  
they are flooded with information from all the academic institutions  
plus other sources, and on the other hand they feel as if they don’t have  
enough information to make a decision. They are subject to uncertainty,  
are confused and afraid to make the wrong choice about something that  
will determine the course the rest of their lives will take. Based on  
what they will read on the website, they want to make a decision. They  
are searching for a clear answer to the question\: why this institution?  
Why should I choose to study specifically here? It is our job to provide  
a simple answer to this question and lay out, in a clear and transparent  
manner, the competitive advantages that our institution has over others,  
advantages that give real value and are important to future students.  
On completing the voice and tone design, we had a list of the main  
competitive advantages that this academic institution has over the  
others in Israel\: exceptional opportunities; social and professional  
networking; an international experience; personal attention, always,  
for everyone; a clear connection between theory and practice and their  
future careers; leading professors; a well groomed and intimate campus;  
values of social responsibility and giving to others; great people come  
and study here, and there are numerous extracurricular activities.  
As we saw in the section on target audience hopes and dreams, you need to  
explicitly highlight the competitive advantages if you want to motivate  
and arouse curiosity in your target audience, and get them to feel that  
you have something unique that your competitors lack. For example, to  
motivate candidates to read more on the site, you can lay out for them the  
competitive advantages from the list we prepared, thus\:  
Voice and tone design | 45 “You are more than welcome to read about our excellent professors, the  
entrepreneurship programs that will open every door for you, and the  
beautiful green campus that will be your home for the next few years.  
Soon you’ll discover that we offer an enormous range of opportunities for  
personal growth, more than anywhere else, and that our graduates are at  
the top of the ‘highest earners’ lists.  
We recommend you read about the international experience \(why not start  
right away networking globally?\), the top-notch students who will attend  
classes with you \(and will become your friends for life\), the practical  
curriculum \(a career is waiting for you at the end of this road\) and  
everything else we offer, apart from academia \(endless experiences\).”  
After you have prepared your list of competitive advantages, you will no  
longer need to think time and again about how to persuade your users to  
stay on your site or select your product or service. Simply ask yourself  
what you are better at than your competition - and say it.  
# 6\. Define the relationship between the brand/  
# product and its users  
The long-term relationship you wish to create  
Everything you write needs to fit the relationship you aim to create,  
so as to establish and support it. Following are some examples of  
relationships\:  
• Friends  
• Best friends  
• Business partners  
• Leader and led  
• Mentor and mentee  
• Salesperson and buyer  
• Celeb and fan  
• People with a shared goal  
• Parents  
• Acquaintances  
• Couple  
• Manager and personal assistant  
46 | Voice and tone design Example\: the two of us against the high  
# cost of living  
Every few years, someone invents a new way of buying online that  
dramatically reduces prices. Users of B4Upay go to this website after  
they’ve done the market research, register the lowest price they found,  
order the product, and give B4Upay the permission to buy it for them at  
an even lower price. The site promises not to charge the user’s credit  
card if they can’t obtain exactly the same product at a lower price than  
the one that the user found. Once the order is placed, B4Upay contacts  
many suppliers and asks them for their best quote for that product. Since  
the suppliers are aware that the product has been ordered and paid for,  
they are strongly motivated to close the deal straightaway. This leads  
them to lower the price for the guaranteed purchase to below its regular  
market price.  
The relationship we wanted to create between B4Upay and its users was  
very well-defined\: the users and the site are a team, fighting on the same  
side against the high cost of living, and act together to get the lowest  
price. To create such a relationship, we emphasized at every opportunity  
this cooperation and the fact that the site is working with them, and for  
them\: “Tell us the lowest price you found, and we’ll get it for you at an  
even lower price”; “Now you can sit back and relax while we contact the  
best suppliers”; “Your item doesn’t appear on the list? Give us a moment  
to fi nd it for you”; “Thank you for ordering with B4Upay! We were happy to  
help you save money at the click of a button”.  
Voice and tone design | 47 Done\: what a voice and tone design looks like  
The voice and tone design can be written in a number of ways and styles,  
and each brand should produce a design that best suits its purposes.  
For most brands and organizations it is enough to prepare an internal  
working document that summarizes all the sections we have discussed in  
this chapter. This will be used by the content people to create microcopy,  
copy or content.  
But for a large corporation that prepares a voice and tone design as  
part of its branding effort, or that wishes to instill a new voice and  
tone to many writers on various media \(site content, microcopy, social  
media, newsletter, contact with users via chat or email, and so on\), it  
is worthwhile to produce a formal guide, branded, well designed and  
with many examples.  
The format is also flexible\: Word doc, Google doc, well designed  
presentation, a website - whatever best suits your needs.  
On the Internet you can find many examples of voice and tone designs.  
Three of my favorites, and that differ considerably from each other,  
are the guide of the University of Leeds \(https\://goo.gl/JvvbZw\),  
Mailchimp’s guide \(www.voiceandtone.com\), and Salesforce's guide \(read  
more about this one in Chapter 19\). Read these three documents and learn  
a lot about written communication in general and voice and tone design  
in particular. Discover and enjoy.  
# The beacon and anchor\: how to use the voice and  
# tone design  
Voice and tone design includes answers to two of the most important  
questions in writing\: what style should you write in, and about what. That  
is why you should constantly refer to it when writing content for your  
website, app, newsletter or social media.  
The beacon\: When answering the question in what style to write, the voice  
and tone design sets the course, provides the character, and maintains  
48 | Voice and tone design the voice and tone you’ll use so that it fits the values and personality  
of your brand. Once you have a good understanding of the voice and tone  
design, you’ll only need to consult it occasionally to brush up on the  
spirit of it and get into character.  
The anchor\: When dealing with messaging, the voice and tone design  
provides all the direction needed. Whenever you ask yourself how to  
motivate to action, what are the barriers and how to remove them, or what  
messages will do the best job, simply open and browse the voice and tone  
design - the answers will always be found there.  
# A personal note to end this chapter  
The voice and tone design is not an end in itself. I have seen organizations  
that have created great voice and tone designs, beautifully decorated in  
the brand’s colors, but failed to write according to what’s in it.  
Why does this happen? Writing is a habit that is hard to break. It is much  
easier to run with the usual words in familiar sentences, with our set  
thought processes. These threaten to return again and again.  
The voice and tone design requires us to shake off old habits and start  
thinking afresh every time so that we write texts that fit our values,  
emphasize what’s important to our users, and achieve the goals we have set.  
The voice and tone design is only the beginning, and once we have completed  
it we should write accordingly - to get out of ourselves and write as if  
we are the brand.  
It’s challenging, fascinating, and it can improve your writing skills,  
taking you one large step forward.  
So don’t be tempted to return to your old ways. If you persevere, you’ll  
quickly turn the voice and tone design to your new second nature.  
Voice and tone design | 49 The questions that will lead you  
\* Incorporate these questions in your branding process or conduct a group interview with  
key personnel.  
Part 1. The Brand  
The vision  
• what change does the brand aspire to promote in the world? How will the world be  
a better place if it succeeds?  
The answer lies in the future, and doesn’t necessarily need to be attainable, but  
rather serve as a beacon to point the way and highlight the ideal outcome.  
The mission  
• What are you doing to fulfill this vision? How are you promoting the change?  
The answer relates to the present, and should concisely describe your main ways  
and areas of action.  
Values  
• What values are important for the brand to maintain and act accordingly?  
• What values are important for the brand to promote in the world?  
• From these values, which are the five most important for you and the brand?  
• Describe each value in a few words. What does it mean to you and what does it  
mean to the brand?  
The personality of the brand  
• If the brand was a person, and they walked into the room, what are the three  
things we’d think about them at first sight?  
• If they sat down to coffee with us and we got to know them better, what else would  
we discover about them?  
• If the brand was a person\: How old are they, how do they dress, what is their  
marital status? When they open the newspaper, what section do they read first  
- Sports, Arts, News? Which type of smartphone do they use - Galaxy or iPhone?  
What are their hobbies and areas of interest?  
• Do they have a sense of humor, and if so, when do they use it?  
• What are they absolutely not?  
• Which famous personality best represents your brand?  
50 | Voice and tone design to your voice and tone  
Part 2. The Target Audience  
Needs and problems  
• What practical problems are solved by your product/service?  
• What emotional worry or stress will your product/service directly ease or  
solve for them?  
Hopes and dreams  
• What do your users want to happen because they used your product/service?  
• What excites them about the idea of the product? What hope does it give them?  
• What are the important values in their lives that will be furthered because they  
used your product?  
• What promise does the brand offer? What does it promise to deliver over time?  
Objections and concerns  
• What could be the reasons that someone who needs your product or service, and  
who knows your website or app, won’t end up using it? What could prevent them  
from trying it out?  
• What are the main concerns users might have throughout the process \(before  
starting, during and after\)?  
• What could confuse or not be fully clear to users?  
Preferences  
• Who are the main competitors of the brand?  
• Does the brand have competative advantages with genuine value for users?  
• Your users could have received a similar product or service elsewhere -  
why should they come to you?  
The relationship between the brand and its users  
• What is the relationship you want to create between your users and the brand?  
• What do you want your users to feel when they are on the website or app, or in  
the brand’s presence?  
• What do your users like to think and feel about themselves? Which self-  
perceptions do you want to encourage?  
• When asked about your brand, what do you want your users to say about it?

# CONVERSATIONAL  
# WRITING  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
Why digital products need to talk  
What is conversational writing  
How to achieve this - rules and tricks How much will you invest in your  
# customer service representatives?  
On the day that the digital product you are currently working on -  
website, app, SaaS, expert system, interactive kiosk, and so on - goes  
live, it will become an official representative of your brand to your  
customers. It will invite them to visit, greet them when they enter, show  
them the product or service, explain to them how it works, and bid them  
farewell when they leave.  
What type of customer service rep do you like to find in front of you? What  
type of customer service rep will get you to trust that the brand really is  
good for you and that they see you? Personally, I much prefer reps with a  
sincere, natural smile and a genuine willingness to help; who are service-  
oriented, talk pleasantly in a manner that respects themselves, their  
brand and me; and who make little jokes that break the ice \(and who react  
to nonsense on my part\); in short, skilled representatives that provide me  
with such personal service that I totally forget that I’m one customer out  
of thousands.  
To create in writing the experience of trust and closeness that flesh  
and blood customer service reps provide, you need to recognize that the  
written words of the interface are actually your conversation with the  
customer. And the more authentic, warm and human it sounds \(yes, even if  
you are an insurance company\), the better the customer experience will be.  
To learn more about the benefits of conversational writing, even for  
traditionally dry industries, see Kate Moran's article "The impact of  
tone of voice on users' brand perception" \(Nielsen Norman Group\).  
Conversational writing | 53 Are you ready to shatter a myth?  
As we saw with the Clifford Nass experiments in the previous chapter, the  
more human the interface, and the more it abides by our social norms, the more  
users connect and respond to it, and are persuaded by what it offers them.  
Therefore, it is important that the voice and tone of the digital product is  
as close as possible to a human conversation.  
In practice, most digital products are far from sounding human. The writing  
is often robotic, formalistic and meager, and creates no sense of personal  
attention. It offers a formal voice and tone that is rigid and aloof, where  
you can hardly find a smile, invitation, warmth or sincerity.  
Examples  
• Error. Please try again  
• Log in to perform this action  
• Enter a valid e-mail address  
• If you do not have an account, you must create one and verify your identity  
on this page in order to continue and complete your transaction.  
Why does it happen? Because from a young age we are taught to write and  
speak in two different styles. The written style is usually formal, more  
complicated, and considered respectable; whereas the spoken style is  
lighter, flowing, more commonplace, understood and accessible to all. In the  
past, written style was used in delayed communication, when the recipient  
read the content after receiving a real piece of paper \(such as a letter\),  
which often arrived many days after it was written. However, spoken style  
was only used in face-to-face communication or on the phone. In other words,  
it was used in personal communication where the message was heard at that  
moment and got an immediate response.  
Then the internet came along and messed things up. Emails reduced the  
gap between delayed and immediate communication; the advent of instant  
messaging closed it almost entirely. When we communicate via Facebook or  
WhatsApp, are we writing or talking? And accordingly, what style do we use  
for a chat app\: written or spoken?  
Carmel Wiseman and Ilan Gonen presented a lovely answer in their book  
54 | Conversational writing Internet Hebrew \(published in Hebrew by Keter, 2005\). They expressed it as  
follows \(page 21\)\:  
The Internet breaks down the age old boundary between the written and  
spoken language, and gives rise to a third option\: conversational writing.  
So we are not looking at a written or spoken language, but rather a new one  
that combines elements of both.  
So, are you ready to shatter a myth?  
You are allowed to write as you speak, using a spoken style.  
But we can’t talk to our customers using incorrect language!  
True! No way should you speak to your customers in substandard language,  
but the spoken style is not necessarily substandard. When you are holding a  
formal conversation with your boss, customer or important supplier, you use  
the spoken style, and it’s not inadequate.  
What’s the difference? An inadequate style is rough, riddled with mistakes  
and leads to misunderstandings. The sentence structure is confusing, and  
it’s inconsistent and sloppy. That is not what I mean. Spoken style is  
polite, respectful, and grammatically correct \(unless you purposely decide  
otherwise - like with intelligent use of slang\); it is consistent, precise  
and unambiguous. Don’t be negligent or confused, conversational writing  
needs to be excellent, but excellence doesn’t imply rigidity and aloofness.  
In other words, interfaces can and should be both\: both representative and  
pleasant; both professional and smiling; both respectful and relating as  
equals. Look around you, humans are like that too.  
Yes, I know, in reality it’s not that simple. Many of those who write for  
digital products have a hard time giving up these distinctions between the  
two language styles, and the concept that one is respectful and the other  
isn’t. Thus they stick to the formal written style, even when the character  
and style of the actual product requires a different voice and tone entirely.  
Sometimes, it is only a matter of not having the right tools for using  
conversational writing. In the following pages I provide tools that will  
help you with that.  
Conversational writing | 55 Don’t write something you wouldn’t say out loud  
Even if your brand is really serious, such as a big bank, insurance  
company or government office, you still don’t need to make users feel  
that you have sent your lawyers to talk to them. It is better to send the  
customer service rep. You don’t want to make your users feel alienated  
or threatened, rather give them the feeling that the product is a worthy  
substitute for a human attentive customer service rep.  
Written style includes words or phrases you simply wouldn’t say out loud,  
even in a formal situation. To create the experience of a service-oriented  
authentic conversation, you need to refrain from using formal stiff  
phrases. The rule is\: don’t write what you wouldn’t say out loud. In the  
following examples I have underlined words that I recommend you remove  
from your digital dictionary. In their place I offer an alternative in  
suitable conversational writing.  
• Enter the phone number you would like to dial \>\> What number do you  
want to call?  
• If you have previously registered for this site, please provide your  
email address and password \>\> Already signed up? enter your email and  
password  
• For verification purposes, an email will be sent to the email address  
you provided \>\> A verification email is on its way to your inbox \(or  
more formally\: was sent to your email address\)  
• It is also possible to make a purchase by phone \>\> You can also call in  
your billing info  
• The products you wish to purchase \>\> Your shopping list  
• Your sign in information is detailed below \>\> Your email and password  
are\:  
• In the event that you forgot your password \>\> If you forgot your  
password  
56 | Conversational writing A sentence isn’t constructed that way  
Two other things we do when writing, that we tend not to do when speaking,  
are related to sentence structure.  
1\. Use the active rather than the passive voice  
When writing formally you might come up with the following sentence\:  
Please select the preferred payment method.  
But “preferred” is the passive form and we wouldn’t put it this way when  
talking out loud \(the preferred method instead of someone preferring it\).  
We’d simply ask the person standing in front of us in the active form\:  
How would you like to pay?  
Or request\:  
Please select a payment method.  
The active structure of the spoken sentence is better because it focuses  
on the person you are talking to. So always use it when writing microcopy.  
2\. Don’t drop the connecting words  
When we talk we connect the parts of the sentence together using  
prepositions, so that it’s clearer and because it is more natural and  
personal that way. But in writing these connections seem to disappear.  
This makes the sentence more complex and hinders the flow of the message.  
Examples  
• Order details \>\> Your order details  
• Close map \>\> Close the map  
• Number of items in basket \>\> Number of items in your basket  
• Save settings \>\> Save these settings  
• Select item \>\> Select an item  
Sentences written using passive voice and without connecting words sound  
forced or awkward, and hinder understanding. So write in active voice and  
make sure to properly connect all the parts of your sentence.  
Conversational writing | 57 Tricks for excellent conversational writing  
1\. Just say it  
Are you undecided about how to phrase something? Imagine the user is  
standing right in front of you, how would you tell them that? Try to be  
as natural and spontaneous as you can, without processing or structuring  
beforehand. It helps when two people do this - one asks and the other  
replies with the first answer that comes to mind.  
2\. Read it out loud  
Does it sound natural? Does it flow? Does it sound as if a real human said  
it? Great.  
3\. Avoid boring formats  
What’s fun about a real conversation is that you never know what to  
expect, and you can’t have the exact same conversation twice. To make  
your texts feel like part of a real conversation, you need to converse.  
Instead of using the usual formats \(The transaction completed  
successfully; Please wait; Error, try again, and so on\), ask yourself\:  
what do I really want to say to the user in this specific context?  
4\. Ask questions  
Questions create a feeling that the conversation flows, as if someone  
asks and the other responds. So instead of “Type the email address you  
want us to send the password to”, you could say “Where should we send  
the link?” This form of sentence also propels the user to act because  
humans find it difficult to leave a question unanswered when they can  
answer it. But you need to be careful not to ask too many questions,  
because then it sounds like an exhausting interview.  
58 | Conversational writing TIP  
# 07  
# 6 attributes of conversational writing  
✓ Addressing the user directly  
✓ Natural  
✓ Short and to the point  
✓ Using everyday common words  
✓ Using active voice  
✓ Flowing  
# Slang - allowed or forbidden?  
Language spiced with slang sounds more human and authentic.  
That’s great, but your digital product, like any customer  
service rep, needs to stay representative. So you have to  
keep within the framework of mainstream and acceptable  
slang. How do you know if the word or phrase is acceptable?  
If you write in your mother tongue, you will know. Trust  
yourself and your instincts. If you write in a language  
different from your mother tongue, have the text checked by  
someone who is a native speaker, to make sure that the slang  
used is light, gentle and representative.  
Second, don’t use culturally specific slang unless writing  
for a mono culture.  
And if it is not obvious\: slang that is hurtful, sexist or  
racist is completely off limits.

MICROCOPY THAT  
MOTIVATES ACTION  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
Benefit is the greatest motivator  
Excited users are more prone to act  
Sometimes you just need to open a door  
Social proof works 4 Important principles to motivate  
# action with writing  
Just before we look at each UI component in depth, here are 4 principles  
that will help you motivate to action with every component, and in fact  
wherever you write to your customers, even outside the digital products.  
# 1\. Talk about the value, not the method  
It only takes a few seconds for a user to decide if the page, website or  
specific action is relevant to them. That means that you only have a few  
seconds to make clear to them the value of staying and performing the  
action. For that to happen, everything needs to be extremely simple, clear  
and persuasive. Explicitly point out\: what they’ll receive from using your  
product or service, what problems you are solving for them, or how it will  
better their lives. If you created a voice and tone design \(see Chapter 1\),  
this is the time to open it and look inside. Everything is written there.  
How do you do that? Change the focus of your texts to what users will gain  
rather than what they need to do to benefit.  
Examples  
Instead of the heading\: A variety of tools to properly manage your finances  
Write\: Put your debts behind you  
Or\: Get rid of your debt once and for all  
Instead of the heading\: A new way to purchase a second-hand car  
Write\: Buy your next car with peace of mind  
Or\: Second-hand car - no hassle, and with a full warranty  
Ask yourself\: What will change for the people who have used your product  
or service? What can they do that they couldn’t before? What problems have  
you solved for them?  
And talk about that.  
Microcopy that motivates action | 61 Note that we are naturally inclined to talk about our brand, product or  
service\: how good it is, what it provides and its relative advantages.  
These are indeed important questions that need answering, but when you  
want users to act, stop talking about yourself, and talk only about them,  
not what you give, but what they receive; not how you solve their problems  
and fulfil their dreams, but how they will get rid of their problems and  
fulfil their dreams.  
Sometimes it is entirely a technical matter. Check who is the subject of  
the sentence, who are you talking about.  
Instead of writing\: Registration will allow you to quickly go through  
checkout \(the subject is registration\)  
Write\: Sign up to checkout quickly  
And instead of writing\: The gift card will let you buy things in 25  
selected stores  
Write\: With this gift card you can shop in 25 selected stores  
# 2\. Amuse me, excite me  
Clifford Nass \(see Chapter 1\) discovered in his research that humor makes  
people feel better about themselves, like and appreciate the interface  
more, and especially, cooperate more and accept its suggestions. With  
that being said, he emphasizes that it is important not to use humor that  
is too intellectual or to use a complex play on words that can leave some  
of your users out of the picture and make them feel stupid. Here too, as  
with slang, avoid using racial, sexist or otherwise offensive humor, and  
never refer to pain or hardship endured by the users. Stay within the  
boundary of good innocent humor \(see the 7 guidelines on page 32\).  
Excited users are also easy to motivate\: they are more focused on the half  
full glass, willing to take more risks, and are ready for action. Actually,  
Nass found that they want to do something so much that they prefer to  
make any decision rather than no decision at all. So if you succeeded in  
exciting your users, the conversion is just around the corner.  
62 | Microcopy that motivates action 3\. Respect your users\: invite them to act  
When I’m talking about a Call to Action, I sometimes call it an Invitation  
to Act. Why? Maybe because I myself don’t like it when people tell me what  
to do \(on the contrary, I immediately don’t want to do it\). I prefer that  
they clearly point out the benefits to me of taking the action, open the  
door for me and let me decide if I want to enter.  
Aggressive service or selling techniques work in the short term, but don’t  
serve the relationship that we want to create on websites or apps. Our  
objective is usually to establish a relationship of trust, continuity,  
and an emotional connection to the brand; provide pleasant memories and  
create a long-term relationship, not just for this encounter, but for  
continuous use, forever. Think about the well-known brands you love most  
- their appeal, elegance, and the sense of mutual respect.  
How do you do that? Explain to your users how they benefit from performing the  
desired action, then invite them to do it. Write in an active and attractive  
but not aggressive voice, and leave out the dirty tricks \(see tip 08\).  
Ask yourself if the invitation provides your users with something that  
is important to them, if it respects them, and if it fits the type of  
relationship you want to create with them in the long term.  
# 4\. Social proof\: and what if everyone jumps off  
# the bridge?  
Humans are social animals, and sometimes it’s amazing to see how much so.  
Social proof is a psychological phenomenon where people decide how to  
act based on the actions of others \(also known as the herd mentality\). For  
example, we’ll always prefer to visit a crowded restaurant rather than a  
deserted one, and we’ll “like” those statuses that have already received a  
few likes rather than a status no one has reacted to yet.  
The fact that others were at this same crossroad, and decided to act in a  
certain way, reduces the level of uncertainty in the situation, creates  
confidence, and makes us feel that we belong to an imaginary community of  
those who’ve already taken this action.  
Microcopy that motivates action | 63 Research has found that social proof dramatically increases the  
conversion rate \(take a look at the book Influence\: The Psychology of  
Persuasion by Professor Robert Cialdini\). Positive social proof can be  
placed right next to buttons so that they act as click triggers \(we’ll  
deal with this more in Chapter 11 that focuses on buttons\), or as part of  
the call to action at the beginning of the process. Many more examples of  
social proof will be presented later in the guide.  
Types of social proof  
• Numbers tell - How many people have already bought this product today  
or in total; how many people use this service; how many people are  
looking at this right now; how many people have downloaded the guide;  
how many hours was this video watched cumulatively.  
• Concrete facts - The name of the last person who used the service; in  
which state the product was bought most. In general, the more concrete  
the social proof \(name, photos, quotes\), the more reliable it is.  
• Opinions, reviews and testimonials of other users.  
• Ratings, for example using stars or quotes from rating sites such as  
TripAdvisor.  
• Official awards and good reviews in the press.  
• Social media - buttons to share or like, with the number of users that  
have clicked them so far.  
• Other customers - the logos or names of respected customers who already  
use the product or service.  
64 | Microcopy that motivates action TIP  
# 08  
# No thanks, I want to stay stupid  
A trend that is currently popular is the use of  
confi rmshaming or manipulink - buttons or links that  
seek to provoke self-doubt and undermine user confidence,  
telling them that if they don’t do as asked - they are  
apparently stupid.  
Examples  
• No thanks, I want my sales to remain low  
• No thanks, I don’t want to save money  
• No thanks, I prefer to miss this opportunity  
Whenever I see such a button, I’m amazed. What logic brings  
brands to make their users feel bad about themselves? The  
answer of course lies in the logic of conversion rate.  
The more users click the button, the better the sales.  
This works, but only in the short term. In the long term,  
you're sacrificing your credibility and users' trust. The  
users will remember that their last interaction with  
your product left them feeling stupid, or that they did  
something they didn’t want to do just because you told  
them they would be stupid not to.  
When you write microcopy, be on the users’ side. Make them  
feel good about themselves, don’t belittle them. Create  
a place that they love to visit and return to. This might  
result in a reduced number of immediate conversions, but  
also with many more loyal users that return whenever they  
need your product or service.  
So instead of writing buttons that callously push your  
emotional ones, invest a bit more in motivating to action  
through highlighting value.

PART 2\:  
EXPERIENCE AND  
ENGAGEMENT Every word is an opportunity  
In the first part of the book, which dealt with voice and tone design,  
we saw how to define the main messages that we need to share with our  
users so that they are motivated to action. What advantages are worth  
stressing, which concerns we should address, how we want them to feel  
when in our company, and so on. In part 2, you’ll see how to actually do  
this on your digital product.  
In each chapter I’ll cover one popular element that we find in sites and  
apps, and how we can turn a regular page to one full of character, a page  
that is distinctive to your brand, one that communicates directly to your  
users’ hearts and motivates them to act willingly.  
In the following chapters, you’ll see that every word, every page and  
every form on your site is an opportunity to prove to your users that they  
are wanted and loved, to increase their activity and to establish your  
brand’s differentiation. Every heading, every field and every button, even  
the most annoying errors, are an opportunity to surprise your users, to  
excite them, and to show that you thought about them and that you have  
something really, really good to offer them. Within each chapter you’ll  
find clear principles that are easy to understand, that you can use when  
writing, and that you can implement immediately.

SIGN UP, LOGIN AND  
PASSWORD RECOVERY  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
An excellent sign up form in 3 steps  
Signing up using a social media account  
Login for registered users  
Password recovery Sign up forms  
When you ask users to sign up to your digital product, you are basically  
telling them that this won’t be their last visit, and that you expect to  
create some sort of relationship with them.  
They have at least two good reasons not to sign up\:  
First, signing up usually includes a form or connecting using a social  
media account. Users really hate filling out forms. It takes time and  
requires typing, they’ll be asked to provide personal details, they’ll  
need to remember, or create, yet another password, and they also risk  
an unintended commitment or payment. The ability to connect using a  
social media account has become widely acceptable, but even here users  
sometimes prefer to skip the registration because of privacy concerns.  
Second, a relationship is a commitment, and who likes to commit to  
something if they don’t really have to? Why should users register on a  
site if they can simply visit it and then peacefully carry on with their  
lives?  
How much do users hate to register? A lot! They’ll even pass on the  
items they put in a shopping cart, and then look for that exact same  
item elsewhere, if they are forced to register before checkout. After a  
large company removed the requirement to register before purchasing  
anything, their profits rose by \$300,000,000 a year \(read the article  
“The \$300 Million Button” by Jared M. Spool\). That’s how much people hate  
to register.  
If so, whether the registration is optional or mandatory, it’s in our  
interest to remove these obstacles so that users will sign up willingly,  
and will understand why they want a relationship with us, and how  
signing up will benefit them.  
Sign up forms | 69 The following form, similar to dozens of others on the Internet, does not  
help users. There is nothing to support a decision by a user to sign up or  
not, and it doesn’t say anything that will stop them from giving up and  
leaving. The site simply displays a form, which they hate, and doesn’t say  
a word. So why should they sign up?  
It’s not enough to design and display a sign up form, you need to also  
motivate users to register. And to achieve that, follow these three steps\:  
1\. Change the title  
Never call your users “users”, so don’t write New user, Existing user, or  
Login for registered users. It's essential to write Sign up, Register or  
Create an account, so users understand where they are and what they're  
expected to do here, but you shouldn’t be just technical. Appeal directly  
to your users and welcome them using conversational writing.  
Add something like\:  
• Nice to meet you  
• You haven’t signed up yet? You’re in the right place.  
70 | Sign up forms • Good to see you \:\)  
• Join now and start to… \(edit photos, find friends, make an album, or  
whatever it is users do with your product\)  
• New here?  
• Let me in!  
• Not a member? Let’s fix that!  
On the other hand, don’t take the creativity too far. You want users looking  
to register to know that they have arrived at the right place.  
Note that I only encourage you to spice up the title of your sign up form.  
Don’t alter the sign up / log in links that appear in the navigation bar.  
Users are looking for exactly those words, and every change will make  
them harder to find. Be creative only on the actual sign up page.  
2\. Tell your users why it’s worth it for them to sign up  
Even if registration is required, give your users good reasons to  
invest the next two minutes of their lives in registering on your  
product. First, prepare for yourself a list of all the advantages  
users have after signing up that they won’t have if they don’t sign up.  
Then, at the top of the form, or next to it, write one crucial advantage  
or 2-3 important advantages in a bulleted list. Don’t go overboard,  
2-3 is enough.  
Examples  
• Fast checkout  
• Create a wish list  
• Only enter your details once  
• Track orders, delivery, and purchase history  
• Track the progress of a process  
• Access to a restricted area of the site, or to special features  
• Monetary perk available only to registered users  
Don’t be careless, select significant advantages that will really  
benefit your users.  
Sign up forms | 71 3\. Remove the obstacles  
Why don’t you register on every site you visit? Let me guess\:  
1\. Because of the time and effort involved in filling out the form.  
2\. Because you don’t want to give them your email and be swamped by spam.  
3\. And sometimes because you are worried they’ll request payment at some  
later stage.  
All users fear this, so talk to them and ease their fears. Clearly promise  
them that the sign up process is short and simple, that you won’t pass  
their email address on to anyone else, and that you won't send them too  
many emails yourself.  
Finally, don't forget the button, the success message and the  
error messages  
Signing up for a digital product is one of your most important processes.  
Don't forget to add a call to action on the button \(see tip 19 in Chapter  
11\), and an excellent success message that makes users feel that signing  
up was the right thing to do \(see Chapter 8\). Naturally, you also need to  
provide clear and pleasant error messages \(see Chapter 7\).  
# Examples  
Nike offers a lot of sporting and personal value, conveyed in a dynamic  
and convincing way that sport lovers understand.  
www.nike.com  
72 | Sign up forms Life is Good, the T-shirt site, provides three classic reasons to register  
in a bulleted list, and points out that the process is easy. However, they  
could spice up the title a bit and make it more fun to sign up.  
www.lifeisgood.com  
TED. The title and first sentence work well together and give users the  
feeling that they are really welcome. Then come the benefits \(carefully  
selected\), presented in a simple and clear style. For those signing up  
with their Facebook account, there is also a promise not to post anything  
without their permission \(see more about signing up using social media  
accounts later in this chapter\).

Sign up forms | 73 Thieve curates special items from AliExpress. Their sign up call to  
action is super straightforward and to the point. I love it. But note  
that because of the design \(black button for Facebook connection, no  
form\), the unusual flow \(signing in is actually signing up\), and the  
laconic phrasing, users might not fully understand that by clicking,  
they connect their social media account with this website they just  
encountered. I think it’s worth mentioning it more clearly.  
www.thieve.co  
Society6 also deals with designed items. The benefits they offer users  
to encourage them to sign up are part of their model that supports  
artists. In this call to action they trust users to have the same love  
for art and for the ones making it.  
www.society6.com  
74 | Sign up forms food.com. You don’t need a title, you can get straight down to business. In  
this way, instead of alarming users by declaring that this is where they  
register, the users read benefits that are important to them, and thus  
keep on reading. If you're into food on social media - this is an offer you  
can't turn down.  
www.food.com  
B4Upay is an Israeli company we already mentioned in Chapter 1. Even  
though signing up to their service is required, they explain why it’s  
good for the users and how filling out the form will make their lives  
easier later. And at the bottom, they promise that signing up and the  
service they provide is totally free.  
www.b4upay.com \(Design\: KRS | Translated from Hebrew\)  
Sign up forms | 75 PayPal tells their users what they can do after they have created an  
account, things that they couldn’t do beforehand. They clearly explain  
what will change and how their users’ lives will improve after signing  
up, and that’s an excellent way to present the main value. The title  
also assures the user that signing up is free, thus removing the  
payment barrier.

Medium, the blogging platform, describes the many benefits registered  
users have over non-registered ones. These benefits are specific to  
the platform, and crucial for fully enjoying it.

76 | Sign up forms TIP  
# 09  
# Register vs. Sign up vs. Join  
Sign up indicates to the user that this is a simple and quick  
digital process; whereas Register would be more appropriate  
when the user needs to fill out a form and provide loads of  
details, such as for a bank, health insurance or a TV provider.  
I recommend using Join if you are trying to create a sense  
of community, and not just invite individuals to receive  
content or services.  
Sign in vs. Log in  
You need to think about not only how the user joins or  
registers, but also how they access the site later. It's  
preferable not to use Sign up and Sign in side by side. Users  
find this confusing and need to stop for a second, and we  
want to make access as easy and intuitive as possible. So if  
you use Sign up, pair it with Log in. Different colors can be  
helpful too. These are the links on PayPal\:  
And these are Coursera's\:  
Log in vs. Login  
Note that Log in phrase is two words, but when referring to the  
page or process it becomes one word - Login page or Login process.  
One last point, if you use Register, make sure your text talks  
about registering or registration to ensure consistency.  
The same goes for when you use Sign up or Join - just keep it  
consistent.  
Sign up forms | 77 Signing up using a social media account  
Signing up via social media lets users register without filling out a  
form, and enables us to get much more information about them - a win-win  
situation. Today, this is considered the standard, and in many digital  
products this is the main sign up method.  
Still, users need to give up a certain measure of privacy, therefore, at  
the top of the page, you should still write about why it’s worth the user’s  
while to click the sign up button.  
Because the concern over privacy is a real problem, and because we ask the  
users to provide much more information than just their email, it is wise  
to add at least one of the following\:  
1\. A promise that you won’t publish anything on behalf of the users. I  
know, this appears again, immediately after, in the Facebook settings;  
but if you want your users to get that far, you need to write it here  
also, next to the sign up button.  
2\. The benefits of signing up via the social media\: It’s the fastest,  
simplest, and most up-to-date way.  
3\. Your users‘ privacy is important to you and you will do everything in  
your power to protect it.  
Today, in most cases, there isn’t enough \(or even any\) mention of these  
issues. In the near future maybe we can give it up, because this way of  
registering will be so commonplace, but as for now it is still important  
and necessary. I saw with my own eyes users give up on registering using  
their social media accounts only because the site didn’t promise to guard  
their privacy.

Sign up forms | 79 Login for registered users  
Returning registered users can be seen as regular customers of the  
website or app; and just as in brick-and-mortar shops regular customers  
are welcomed with warmth, so they should be treated online. Instead of  
writing only Log in or Registered users, you can say something that will  
raise a smile and show your users that you are happy they chose to return,  
that they are welcome and loved here.

each time the user comes back. LOL

times. So just be nice, not too clever.

www.emojicom.io  
Login forms | 81 Password recovery  
Users who want to log in but have forgotten their password are not  
interested in anything else except getting a new password. This is not  
the place to be clever, and there’s no need to elaborate. Keep it short,  
simple and effective.

Tumblr proves that extra words are superfluous when most of your users  
already know their way around.

it works, you can add a short explanation.

SIGN UP FOR  
A NEWSLETTER  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
3 styles of CTAs to sign up for a newsletter  
A persuasive invitation in 3 steps Why should I sign up?  
To you it is obvious why a newsletter is necessary. It delivers value to  
your customers over an extended period of time, keeps them aware of your  
brand, and develops a relationship with them based on familiarity and  
trust; it keeps them up-to-date on new developments, and of course - it  
sells. As a result, nearly every business tries really hard to generate a  
mailing list and distribute a newsletter on a regular basis.  
The problem is that however much we want our users to sign up, they  
likewise don’t want to. They see it as an invitation to spam them and  
receive piles of unwanted information. They need a really, really good  
reason to risk signing up.  
The invitation to sign up for the newsletter appears in a variety of ways\:  
a pop-up displayed when the user accesses the product or after they have  
scrolled down a bit, a check box when signing up, a form in the footer or  
on the side bar, or all of the above \(see tip 10\).  
Invitations shown today can be divided into three main categories\:  
1\. The boring  
A drab one sentence invitation using a well-worn template that can appear  
on any website, and doesn’t arouse any interest.  
Examples  
• To sign up for our newsletter, please provide the following details\:  
• Sign up for our newsletter!  
• Sign up here and get our newsletter delivered directly to your inbox  
• Join the X mailing list  
Even if you put such a sentence in a beautiful well-designed pop-up,  
you need to remember that your users see a dozen similar pop-ups each  
day, and they need to decide which one they should sign up for. Why  
would such a sentence cause the user to give you their email address,  
something they guard zealously? When have you recently signed up for  
such a newsletter?  
Sign up for a newsletter | 85 2\. The keeping-you-up-to-date  
Receive updates, be the first to know, stay in the loop and don’t miss  
out! How many variations there are to the promise, and they all say  
basically nothing.  
Examples  
• Don't miss a post! Enter your email address to receive notifications of  
new posts by email.  
• Be the first to learn about new products, sales, and promotions!  
• Sign up for our newsletter and be the first to know about coupons and  
special offers.  
On the one hand, if the users are already on your site, they know what  
it has to offer, right? And if you offer to keep them up-to-date via  
the newsletter, they’ll know what will be updated, right? And they’ll  
definitely want to never miss a thing, yes? Well actually no. That is  
to say, they basically know what the site deals with, they generally  
want to stay updated, and they more or less know about what they will  
be updated, but that isn’t enough.  
Users see these update invitations, like the first boring category,  
all the time. The invitation could appear on practically any site, and  
it leaves the users guessing how they’ll benefit from signing up for  
that specific newsletter.  
But our users don’t have the spare time, patience, or overview of your  
business to understand by themselves what you offer in the newsletter  
and how they benefit from it. You need to explicitly tell them.  
86 | Sign up for a newsletter 3\. The persuasive  
The invitation to sign up for the newsletter must be exactly like any  
other sales pitch. Do you want your users to give you their email? Give  
them a good reason why! A good reason is one that is good for them, one  
that will add something to their lives, and will change them even if ever  
so slightly. Don’t present a general and vague reason that anyone else  
could have written, rather tell them exactly what they’ll receive in their  
inbox from your specific newsletter that is worthwhile and help them  
overcome their aversion to providing their email address.  
If you have created a voice and tone design, you already know what the  
users want to happen to them as a result of using your product or service.  
Use this knowledge to phrase your invitation.  
# TIP  
# 10  
# Excuse me, have we met?  
If you display the newsletter invitation pop-up  
immediately after users land on your site, it is like  
a complete stranger coming up to them from out of  
nowhere and offering a relationship. Strange, right?  
At this stage they have no reason to sign up, they don’t  
know you yet, and they certainly don’t trust you.  
Invite users to sign up for the newsletter only after they more  
or less understand what you have to offer them. For example,  
after spending a minute browsing the site, after they have  
read about half a post, perhaps only after they access another  
post, or scrolled all the way down to the footer. The point is  
that you should have some sort of an indication that the users  
understand what the site is all about.  
Sign up for a newsletter | 87 This is how you can motivate users to sign up  
# for the newsletter  
1\. Change the title  
Sign up for our newsletter or join our mailing list are not effective  
titles because they tell users what we are asking them to do \(sign up\)  
rather than what we are giving them. In other words, they tell the users  
the road they will be taking rather than the benefit they will be getting.  
So write the value the newsletter provides in the title, tell them up  
front how it will alter their lives.  
For example, if your newsletter deals with relationships, instead of  
writing "sign up for our newsletter", write\:  
Were you told that a successful relationship is hard work?  
Make it an exciting adventure!  
2\. Tell your users what’s in it for them if they sign up  
Only after your users understand from the title that the offer is  
interesting, can you invite them to sign up and tell them what they’ll  
receive. Updates, news or the latest offers are not enough. Be more  
specific and relevant to your unique brand. What exactly are you planning  
to send your users? Naturally you should choose those elements that you  
think will interest your users most. Remember that you are selling your  
brand’s newsletter, so this is the place to demonstrate your marketing  
writing skills.  
Offer benefits that users can immediately understand and say\:  
Yes, that’s something I really want to know. I’d be happy to receive this  
in my inbox.  
88 | Sign up for a newsletter Continuing with the previous example of a newsletter about relationships\:  
Were you told that a successful relationship is hard work?  
Make it an exciting adventure!  
Sign up now and every week you’ll get\:  
• Tips on rejuvenating relationships that you won’t find elsewhere  
• Exclusive interviews with leading couples counselors  
• Recommended romantic spots, and more  
3\. Remove the obstacles  
Spam is the most common obstacle that stops users from signing up for a  
mailing list. And spam for your users is not only emails that they didn’t  
ask for, but also too many emails that they did request \(i.e. yours\). To  
deal with these two concerns\:  
a. Promise them that the frequency of your newsletter is low, and you can  
even mention how often.  
b. Promise that the email addresses are well guarded and that their privacy  
is important to you.  
Finally, don’t forget the button, the success message and the  
error messages  
Signing up for a newsletter is like any other digital process. You need  
to provide text for the button so that it motivates the user to click  
it \(see Chapter 11\), and an excellent success message that will leave  
your users curious and expectant to receive their first newsletter \(see  
Chapter 8\). It is also worthwhile to invest a bit in writing a gracious  
error message, in case the user made a mistake when entering the email  
address \(see Chapter 7\).

# Free content! Download now!  
If you offer free content for download or by email, the  
invitation to download works in exactly the same way as  
when signing up for a newsletter.  
1\. Provide an attractive title that offers a specific value.  
2\. Tell the users about the benefits they’ll receive  
from the content - how their lives will improve after  
reading it.  
3\. Guarantee privacy and that you won’t pass on their  
email address.  
# Are you concerned your users won’t read?  
# Don’t worry  
The secret of persuasion is to always tell your users how  
they’ll benefit. Michael Aagaard of ContentVerve tried it on  
his site and published his findings in the article “How to Write  
High-Converting Sign-Up Form Copy”.  
The control form had\:  
Get Fresh Updates from ContentVerve.com  
The non-generic version had\:  
Get Fresh Updates  
• Case Studies & test results  
• How-to videos & articles  
• Podcasts w/thought leaders  
Actually, Aagaard only provided a very short list of what his  
users would actually receive if they read his newsletter \(and I  
assume he carefully selected those items that most interested  
his customers\).  
What was the impact? An 83.75% increase in sign-ups.  
Worth it, don’t you think?

# But we really do only offer deals….  
If your newsletter is strictly a sales channel, and  
simply provides updates about discounts and offers,  
then first of all you should think about upgrading it to  
be more magazine-like and include added value, such as  
recommendations from professionals \(“our stylist will  
turn you into the offi ce star”\), an interesting list that  
you have assembled \(“the fi ve top restaurants last month”\),  
interviews, success stories, and even in-depth articles.  
If you don’t have the time or budget to change the  
newsletter, then at least add a few specifics to the sign  
up form. Remind the users of the brand and make it your  
unique invitation. For example\:  
• Not only “You’ll receive a discount”, but rather  
“Receive a discount on \[brand's name\] new awesome summer  
collection”.  
• Don’t just write “We’ll send you offers”, but rather  
“Receive special offers for the best rooms in the  
most sought after hotels”.  
• Don’t write simply “Updates”, but rather “Receive  
updates on new job openings before they are uploaded  
on the site”.  
This is how Walmart did it\:

GoodUI tests patterns of interfaces to find out which work better. In their  
newsletter invitation, they don’t even mention it’s a newsletter. Instead  
they state the benefits for the user - they’ll get the findings. In other words  
- we do the work, you get the results. Awesome. The button also delivers  
value \(see Chapter 11\), and beneath it they have a reassuring message and  
the specific frequency of their emails, to alleviate spam concerns.

from Marie Forleo, the American life coach \(Forleo already replaced it,  
but it’s still my favourite\).  
www.marieforleo.com \(a previous version\)  
What’s so good about this invitation?  
1\. The title, which offers a precise, super attractive value - we’ll help  
you create the life and business you’ll love.  
2\. The value is shown, not the act of signing up -The invitation uses words  
and values that the users are looking for. Forleo doesn’t hide behind  
long explanations on how you’ll get there, but rather focuses on the  
ultimate goals, to fulfil your dreams, increase your profits, become  
happier and wiser, and to love yourself more. Note that the invitation  
hardly mentions Forleo and her business, but instead focuses entirely  
on the users.  
3\. The frequency of the emails is clearly stated - weekly.  
4\. There is social proof - winning an award.  
5\. You can feel Forleo’s personality in every word she writes -  
charismatic and sees you as a peer, she sets demanding goals but is  
warm and empathic, business-like but human, and very, very feminine.  
94 | Sign up for a newsletter In her current newsletter CTA, Forleo takes the path of social proof, and  
then gives users the feeling that by signing up they join an exciting  
exclusive community.  
www.marieforleo.com  
By the way, have you noticed that 5 out of 6 examples shown here don't mention  
the word newsletter, but it’s still perfectly clear that’s what it’s all about?  
This is because users might be intimidated by this word, and you can just  
leave it out - as long as you make it clear in other ways.  
# In the margins but not marginal  
Even secondary invitations to sign up for the newsletter, those that  
always appear in the footer or on the side bar, need to be more than just  
“Sign up for our newsletter”. Despite the limited space, try to say in a  
few words why it is worthwhile to sign up and state the frequency.

# CHAPTER  
Why the Contact page is so important  
A Contact page for interested customers  
A Contact page for support How may we help you?  
Your digital product is the virtual version of your organization or  
business. The Contact page is therefore customer service, the place users  
turn to when they want to engage with you or need help. In both cases -  
whether it is a potential customer, or an existing customer who needs  
support or an answer - the Contact page should be the most inviting and  
service-oriented page on your product.  
That’s why it always surprises me when I see the contact form presented as  
if someone was forced to put it up. They can be well designed, but there is  
nothing that even hints that whoever provided the page actually wants you  
to contact them, that they really want to help, or that there is actually  
someone who reads what was written. For example\:  
Mute forms like these are like the customer service rep who instead of  
brightly welcoming you with “How may I help you?” stands in front of you  
with a vacant expression and simply waits. A bit strange, don’t you think?  
By the way, sentences like “We’d be happy to hear from you and answer any  
question you might have”, “Your input is important to us!” “Our company  
Contact us | 97 invests heavily in the satisfaction of its customers”, or “Dear customer,  
please fi ll in your details and we’ll get back to you during the next  
working day”, are so banal and lack credibility, that it is as if you didn’t  
write anything. Also, avoid one of the many versions of “In the continuing  
effort to improve our service, we’d love to hear any question you might  
have”. Improving your service is not what I’m here for, I need you to  
solve my very specific problem now, and if possible, receive personal  
attention, that will help me a lot.  
So to write a great Contact page, first ask yourself in what specific  
situations users who visit your site will need it, and what will they want to  
achieve using it. Then create a unique message that fits them, and only them.  
# 1\. A Contact page designed for potential  
# customers  
The purpose of corporate sites and service provider sites \(such as  
therapists, studios, agencies etc.\) are for users to contact them. In fact,  
the sole reason these sites are created is so that users will write to  
them or contact them and start to work together. This can be to arrange a  
meeting, order the service, check the price, find out more about the work  
process, and so on. In a way, all the persuasive effort you have invested  
in the content pages is channeled to the Contact page. There it should  
turn curiosity or desire into action, such as filling out a form, sending  
an email, or picking up the phone.  
Now is not the time to take your foot off the gas, on the contrary, you  
need to strengthen the user’s feeling that contacting you is an excellent  
choice, and exactly the right thing to do.  
Like signing up on a site or for a newsletter, here also you start by  
changing the usual title Contact Us with a title that provides value.  
After that, tell the users how they will benefit by contacting you. If you  
prepared your voice and tone guide, you’ll find in it what your users want  
to achieve most from a relationship with you. If you haven’t prepared the  
guide, now too is a good time to ask this question.  
98 | Contact us Examples  
Netcraft, a UX agency, considers its Contact page exactly as if it were a  
sales page, and gives users, potential customers, five good reasons to make  
contact. Reasons 1+2 create trust, reason 3 promises value, and reasons  
4+5 are to inject some fun, an inseparable part of their brand. Wonderful!  
www.netcraft.co.il  
Epipheo, a company that produces videos for their clients, used to have on  
their Contact page a superb invitation that explains exactly what I mean  
when I say that you should continue selling right to the end. It creates  
trust, is authentic and full of character, and most important, it reminds  
users that Epipheo can help them achieve their business goals. The excellent  
wording summarizes for the users, just before they make contact, why in  
fact they should be contacting Epipheo. And still, I think that such a long  
paragraph might scare users away, and it's better to keep it 2-3 lines short.  
www.epipheo.com \(a previous version\)  
Contact us | 99 2\. A Contact page designed for support  
If your service or product does not entail the need to contact you, then  
the Contact page is usually used for support, inquiries, and questions.  
And if good service is one of your values, you surely understand that the  
moment a customer needs support or an answer is exactly the time to be at  
your most service-oriented, and show them that you are there for them, that  
you’ll be happy to help them, and that the faith they have placed in you is  
justified. That’s what your Contact page should do. How can you achieve this?  
1\. Write the invitation honestly, willingly and generously. Your service  
will be judged not only when everything goes smoothly, but mostly when  
your users need you. Don’t fake it, it doesn’t work.  
2\. Be precise. Switch slogans like “any question or suggestion” with  
wording that is directly related to your product or service. Question  
about what? Suggestions relating to what interest?  
3\. This might sound strange, but even the contact form includes obstacles  
that need to be removed. Users fear that their request is one out of  
a million, that you won’t read it, or by the time they do receive an  
answer they’ll have forgotten why they contacted you. Promise them  
that you read all the support inquiries and mention how long it takes  
you to reply.  
# TIP  
# 13  
# Joking aside  
In most cases, a little joke or an authentic smile can break  
the ice, create rapport, and improve the atmosphere. But if  
you have a Contact page dedicated to inquiries and support,  
your customers will sometimes go there when they are angry,  
frustrated or simply don’t know what to do.  
If you have written an amusing contact text, reread it as if  
you are a dissatisfied user, and make sure that it doesn’t make  
you even angrier or might be construed as sounding cynical.  
It’s better to play it safe when it comes to a Contact page.  
100 | Contact us Examples  
Ikea provides a range of possible reasons to contact them. They emphasize  
that they’ll solve the problem quickly and easily, and enable you to get back  
to relaxing on your new sofa, the reason you came to Ikea in the first place.  
www.ikea.com  
Marie Forleo, the successful life coach, warmly invites you to contact  
her, whether with questions or compliments, and she writes in the voice  
and tone that fits her personality and brand. Even more importantly, she  
understands that users are not sure where their inquiries are sent when  
talking about a virtual company, who reads them, and how long it takes  
to receive a reply, if at all. Forleo addresses all these concerns and  
promises that all inquiries are read and that they endeavor to answer  
them within 48 business hours.  
www.marieforleo.com  
Contact us | 101 Oh Happy Day is a cool party shop that does include a small smile on its  
Contact page \(but you need to be careful about this, see tip 13\). They also  
promise to reply within two business days max.  
www.shop.ohhappyday.com  
But it is better to be more specific than “If you have any questions” or  
“Need to return something?” Connect the sentence to the subject matter of  
the site. For example\:  
• Do you have any questions about our colored confetti?  
• Does the color of the balloons not match the napkins and you need to  
return them?  
• Do you want to share with us other cool accessories that we haven’t  
thought about?  
If you have several different groups of customers, and want to say something  
slightly different to each group, you can provide a separate link for each  
one that leads them to the relevant form, like they do in JetBlue.  
www.jetblue.com  
102 | Contact us NPR, the US public multimedia news organization and radio program  
producer, also uses this system, and clicking a button displays a form  
relevant to that subject.  
www.npr.org  
FAQs or online help is a service that many users will be happy to get  
instead of waiting for an answer from you. Having said that, users might  
feel that you’re trying to shake them off and stop them from contacting you.  
To avoid that, when referring users to online help, stress that you’d love  
to hear from them, and that FAQs are really the fastest way to help them.  
InVision provides tools to design, review and test products. First they  
promise they will always be there for you, and only then suggest you try  
the help center for technical issues. In any case, the contact form is  
available right below this message and you can choose it easily.

Contact us | 103 Typeform uses a typeform on their Contact page \:\) When users state  
they need help with a form, they are first referred to the help center,  
but Typform makes sure you know their support team are also always  
available.  
www.typeform.com  
104 | Contact us 14  
TIP Categorizing inquiries by topic  
# or urgency  
When you are creating the subject categories or the level  
of urgency for the contact form, change your internal  
professional terminology into the language of your users.  
In other words, ask yourself what this inquiry is referring  
to from the point of view of your users, not you.  
For example\:  
• Ordered products \> My orders  
• Billing issue \> Question about payment  
• System error \> Problem with the site  
• General \> Something else  
That’s how Men with Pens, a site that offers to design  
and write content for websites, did it\:  
www.menwithpens.ca  
If your form includes levels of urgency, this is how  
buffer, a site that provides tools to increase social  
media activity used to put it. Simply great.

ERROR MESSAGES  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
The 3 goals of error messages  
A useful error message in 2 steps  
The voice and tone of error messages  
The error messages every site needs First aid for the baffled user  
Error messages are the only text we write that we hope users will never  
see. Therefore, the correct thing is to prevent users making errors, and  
you can read about that in Chapter 17, which deals with preventing errors  
and frustration. However, users are most likely to see some of your error  
messages, and thus you need to word them so that they offer real help.  
An error message temporarily stops the process the users are trying  
to complete. As far as they are concerned, the message delays them and  
requires them to understand what went wrong and how they should continue.  
Since their motivation is already fragile, error messages could be the  
last straw, leading them to abandon the process, especially if messages  
are unclear, intimidating or make them feel bad.  
Therefore, error messages need to fulfill three goals\:  
1\. Explain simply and clearly that there is a problem and what that  
problem is.  
2\. Provide a solution so that users can return and complete the process  
immediately.  
3\. Turn the delay into an experience that is as pleasant as possible.  
Usually, error messages concern technical problems that need resolving,  
so the emphasis should be on clarity and practicality. Don’t be too clever  
with the text, and make it as simple as possible. It’s also not the place  
to make fun of the user or to make light of the delay they endure. But  
that doesn’t mean the messages need to be cold. On the contrary, precisely  
because errors cause discomfort, write the messages in a natural and  
human voice, so that they will make the delay as friendly as possible,  
just like a good customer service rep would do if you encountered this  
problem when meeting them face to face.  
Error messages | 107 The perfect error message in 2 steps  
1\. Describe the problem and what went wrong as precisely as you can.  
2\. Provide a constructive suggestion on how to solve the problem and carry  
on forward. If the problem can’t be solved at that moment, tell the user  
what can be done to help them, and who they can turn to.  
Except when\: In the standard error messages associated with the sign up  
form or login \(such as an incorrect password or an existing username\), you  
can sometimes leave out one of these two \(description of the problem or  
its solution\), because the situation is so well known to users that both  
the problem and the solution are obvious.  
# TIP  
# 15  
# Four things you need to know to write good  
# error messages  
1\. What was the user trying to do when they got an error?  
2\. Why did the system respond with an error?  
3\. What can the user do to carry on and complete the process?  
4\. If there is no solution, is there an alternative action you  
can offer them \(such as turning to support\)?  
# The more generic, the less helpful  
If - due to budget or development limitations - you must  
phrase a single error message for a few different scenarios,  
it means it’ll be a rather generic message\: you can’t describe  
what went wrong \(there are a few possible options\), and you  
can’t tell the users how to fix it \(because you don’t know  
which problem they need to fix\). You’ll face the same issue  
if your system can’t recognize what exactly caused the error.  
There’s no magic solution here - for error messages to be  
helpful they need to be relevant to the context they appear in.  
If you can’t phrase specific messages, at least be as positive  
and friendly as you can.  
108 | Error messages Voice and tone of error messages\:  
# human and service-oriented  
In Chapter 2, I described how to write in a conversational style, and how  
to avoid the formal writing style. One very important place to implement  
this is when writing error messages, so that they'll be really helpful and  
readable, and prevent users from closing the alert before reading it all  
the way through.  
1\. Write without rigidity, threat or giving orders, and generally without  
sounding like a lawyer.  
Not this way\:  
• Fill in this field  
• This field is mandatory  
• You cannot proceed, the following fields are incorrect  
• You must provide a mobile phone number  
• Dear customer, you are not allowed to perform this action  
2\. Write without a trace of the words error or failure.  
Not this way\:  
• Error! Please correct the field  
• Error in one or more fields  
• The action failed. Try again  
3\. Write without using technical terms, such as validation or  
verification, legal, certified, unsupported action, system, permission  
or the serial number of the error.  
Not this way\:  
• FATAL ERROR\: Unhandled c0001du exception at 31c71014h  
• The validation of media ids failed  
• There was a problem retrieving the XML data\: undefined  
• Invalid login credentials  
• Illegal email address  
• Validation error  
• Error 5647GV  
Error messages | 109 Instead of writing such intimidating texts, you need to write error  
messages that do not blame the user, but simply describe the problem, in  
the most service-oriented way and in a pleasant conversational tone, and  
then propose a solution.  
One great way to do that is to say what’s possible instead of what’s not.  
Instead of\: Phone number is invalid  
Say\: Phone number should be 10 digits  
Instead of\: You cannot book this flight  
Say\: Direct flights to Dublin are only available in August  
# TIP  
# 16  
# Humor in error messages - yes or no?  
The amount of humor you can use in error messages depends  
on your brand’s voice and tone. If your brand is light  
and flowing, you can definitely write messages that make  
the user smile; but remember that first and foremost the  
message needs to be clear and practical, and provide a  
solution to the problem. Being too clever could delay  
users and might be seen as belittling their problem. Keep  
the humor light and make sure it doesn't make it difficult  
for the user to understand.  
This error message, from the OurHome app for managing  
family tasks, appears if you state you’re over 122 years old.  
It’s super funny, and far too long, but it obviously wasn’t  
meant to be practical in the first place, but rather to make  
users laugh. Worked for me!  
OurHome app  
110 | Error messages Examples  
These two error messages say practically the same thing\:  
The first takes the negative path \(what is not possible\), while the second  
\(by Hipmunk\) takes the positive path \(what is the maximum\) and adds a  
wink. The difference in the experience is enormous.  
By the way, the wink is great when it fits the brand’s voice, but it isn’t  
necessary. If your voice is more conservative, it can still deliver a less  
negative experience by saying what is possible, instead of what’s not\:  
Reservations can be maximum 30 nights long.

Fitbit. Even if the user can’t do anything to fix the problem, for example  
a communication failure, it’s important to tell them it’s out of their  
hands, so they don't try and fix it, resulting in even greater frustration.  
Fitbit describes the situation well, both in words and with a lovely  
graphic. After apologizing and explaining what the problem is, they  
suggest a few ideas on how to pass the time, and lighten the mood after an  
annoying experience. This is a good example of a graphic and microcopy  
that support each other well and fit the message.

very annoying scenario of the browser being out-of-date and unable to

and our users. PicMonkey, a site that lets users edit photos, turned the  
lemon into lemonade, and the frustrating experience into a good laugh  
befitting the style of their brand. Users still need to install a new  
browser, but at least they’ll do it in good spirits.

# TIP  
# 17  
# Don’t leave it up to your techies  
All error messages, both the standard messages and the  
special ones, need to be written, or at least approved, by  
your microcopy writer. It is advisable to give the software  
developers as many carefully worded error messages as  
possible before they even start working on your system \(a  
list of most common errors that need to be worded is at the end  
of this chapter\). In this way they can easily integrate them.  
Having said that, you will discover new scenarios requiring  
error messages as development progresses. Don’t leave these  
to the developers to write. It’s not their job to write them,  
and maybe they’ll be good at it, but maybe not. Make sure they  
know that if they do discover a need for new error messages,  
they should pass them along to your microcopy writers with  
a description of the scenario, so that they can phrase them.

3 goals of success messages  
4 components of a good success message All’s well that ends well  
In the first part of this book, I presented the fascinating results from  
the research of Professor Clifford Nass. He found that when humans use  
a digital interface, they expect it to behave according to acceptable  
social norms, even though they understand that they are dealing with a  
computer. This includes reacting to their actions, complimenting them  
when appropriate, and helping them when something has gone wrong.  
Success messages that users see after they have performed an action are  
one of the most important responses that they expect to receive.  
Following are some examples of actions that conclude with a success message\:  
• Signing up or joining a site/event/service  
• Purchase or order of a product/service/subscription  
• Signing up for a newsletter  
• Unsubscribing  
• Downloading a free guide  
• Sending a contact form  
• Download/upload of file/program/plugin  
• Import/export of data/files  
• Validation of email addres  
• Opting in for a free trial  
• Recovering a password, and so on  
Why are success messages so important? They have 3 goals\:  
1\. Provide certainty. The message confirms to the user that the action  
completed successfully and that everything is okay.  
2\. Instruct. The message tells the user about the next optional or  
mandatory step.  
3\. Connect. The message is the final piece of the process, and it can be  
moving, funny or even exhilarating. It can add extra meaning to the  
action and leave users with a good positive feeling about your brand and  
the pleasant experience they had with it.  
Success messages | 117 You don’t have to always accomplish all these goals. Sometimes a simple  
tick that appears for a few seconds and then disappears is enough. For a  
frequent and simple action, such as sending an email or saving a document,  
write a super short and practical success message. But the more important  
the action is for users, the fuller the success message should be.  
So how is it done? Not this way\:  
• The transaction was completed successfully  
• Registration was successful  
• Your order was successfully received  
• Your email address was successfully confirmed  
The template “X successfully completed” serves only the first goal,  
to provide certainty, and it does it in a boring, impersonal, detached  
manner. So avoid it or make sure that it isn’t the main part of the message,  
and provide content to achieve at least one of the other goals.  
Instead of using a worn out template, do one or more of the following, or  
even better, do them all.  
1\. Talk about or to the user, not about the action they just completed.  
Refer to the person who completed the process, and not the process  
itself. For example, when uploading photos to your profile on the  
dating site OkCupid, you don’t see Photo uploaded successfully, but a  
different message for each photo you upload, and all of them are fun  
and make you feel good.  
www.okcupid.com  
118 | Success messages 2\. Give a clear indication that what the user wanted to do, did in fact  
occur, but you don’t need to write using the template “X successfully  
completed”. Try to be as clear as possible but slightly different.  
Note that in the previous example, from OkCupid, this was implied by  
showing the uploaded photo and reacting to it.  
Following is the tiny success message you get from The Outline,  
the kicking publication, after signing up for their newsletter.  
This acronym \(that stands for talk to you soon\) serves two purposes\:  
confirming the subscription, and building expectation as to what  
exactly you’re going to talk about. By the way, if you're going for a  
global audience, try to avoid acronyms - they're guaranteed to send  
some confused users to Google in search of clarification.  
www.theoutline.com  
3\. If relevant, include a deeper, meaningful aspect of the action taken.  
How? Briefly remind users of the value they received from taking the  
action, how it effects them and is important to them.  
For example, if they signed up for a newsletter, remind them that  
treasure will be delivered soon to their inbox, so that they can’t wait  
for the first newsletter to arrive.  
If they bought a leisure product, be excited with them and make them  
feel good about it.  
If they contacted you via the contact page, make them feel that their  
faith in you is justified and that you’re on the case.  
And so on.  
Success messages | 119 A success message that does this really well is the one provided by  
WordPress after installation\:  
www.wordpress.com  
The message is funny, but also says that they kept their promise for  
a simple, intuitive platform, and that getting their product was an  
excellent choice that made your life much easier.  
4\. Present and promote the next step for you and your users. For example\:  
• What’s going to happen now \(how long will it take to answer their mail,  
when you expect to send the purchase, when will the subscription start,  
if the registration process needs activation, and so on\).  
• Refer them to their inbox if you are going to send them an email \(to  
verify the address or to see an order summary\).  
• Further actions that you want users to perform \(a link to the page  
where users start using the product, invitation to download your app,  
invitation to share or follow you on social media\).  
• If you don’t have another step, send them back to the site to  
something that really interests and is important to you, such as  
promotions or blog.  
I recommend reading Talia Wolf's post "Use these 7 hacks on your thank  
you pages to boost retention".  
120 | Success messages This is Marie Forleo’s success message after subscribing to her  
newsletter. She does everything said here\:  
1\. 2. 3. 4. 5. Talks to the users about themselves and her relationship with them,  
not about the action.  
Gives certainty that the sign up was successful, but without using  
this technical term.  
Gives the action extra meaning - becoming an insider and connecting  
with her personally.  
Refers users to their inbox to read the first email, using a great call  
to action that sounds very honest.  
Elegantly promotes the next step - encouraging users to follow her on  
social media as well.  
www.marieforleo.com  
Success messages | 121 More examples  
Epipheo creates videos for businesses. The goal of their website is to  
get users to contact them and start working together on a shiny new video.  
After the contact form has been sent, users receive the following success  
message that thanks them, promises personal attention from an expert, and  
immensely increases credibility by introducing the business developers  
in person, with photos! This is a wonderful combination of personal and  
professional that makes me feel that contacting them was the right thing  
to do. And they didn’t skip on suggesting the next step - joining their  
Facebook group.  
www.epipheo.com  
After giving feedback on one  
of Wix's new features, they  
say what it actually means\:  
You just improved the  
feature. The illustration  
shows their gratitude and  
completes the copy. Very  
satisfying.  
www.wix.com  
122 | Success messages Rounds. This is the success message after installing their app. Some  
people claim that a pat on the back can be seen as condescending, but  
Clifford Nass discovered with his research that even though users  
realize that the compliments are entirely random and not personal, they  
still feel good about themselves, and appreciate the interface. Yes, we  
humans are weird, so go ahead and compliment your users, no biggie.  
The next step!  
Rounds app  
Envato's success message upon completion of the security check is very  
short, but also surprising, funny, conveys a true sense of cooperation, and  
tells the users how they benefited\: by having a secured account.

EMPTY STATES  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
How to turn a dead end into an open door  
Empty states for features before first use  
Empty states for an empty cart and previous orders  
Empty states for search results Nothing to see here, move along?  
Words don’t only empower and sharpen an experience, they can also create  
it, even when it seems that there is nothing to experience. Microcopy for  
empty states is the best example of this.  
But first, let’s go back to the definition. Empty states are those states  
where there is nothing to show users. They can appear when the user first  
encounters a digital product or a feature in it, and they can also appear  
as a result of use, such as running a search that returns no results.  
When you leave the empty state empty, you are basically telling your users  
what there isn’t. You are missing out on the opportunity to tell them what  
there is. For example, what could have been here, what they could gain from  
it, and what they can do to get things moving. A feature that hasn’t yet been  
used is an opportunity to present its benefits and encourage them to use  
it. An empty cart is an opportunity to encourage a sale. A search that ended  
without results provides the opportunity to show you care, by offering  
other options and preventing the users from leaving empty handed. This  
isn’t only a chance to offer good service, but also to direct the users  
towards the next step and get them back in business.  
Empty states | 125 1\. Empty states of features before first use  
77% of all app downloads are discarded within three days of being  
downloaded, so wrote Dina Chaiffetz in “Why empty states deserve more  
design time” \(InVision Blog\). Obviously we can’t put all the blame on  
empty states, but they do play a very important role in creating the user’s  
first impression of your website, app or service.  
Imagine users browsing through your site after registering \(or app after  
downloading\), and all they see is\:  
• There are no items in your basket \(or cart, or even bag\)  
• Your wish list is empty  
• No previous actions were found  
• You haven’t saved any favorites  
• No messages  
• You don’t have any friends in your network, and so on.  
Often these empty state messages appear on a totally blank page - inches  
and inches of emptiness.  
What a waste! After a short tour of such a static and ineffective product,  
users will feel that you don’t have much to offer and that this site won’t  
exactly change their lives.  
When users open a page or feature that they haven’t used before, you have  
an opportunity to show them the feature’s potential and motivate them to  
start using it.  
126 | Empty states Instead of saying that there is nothing here, write about what is supposed  
to be here or what they can do here, what this feature does and how it can  
help them.  
If relevant, add instructions. Tell users exactly how to start using the  
feature \(if possible, its best to add a visual\), or provide a link.  
# Examples of empty states of features before  
# first use  
Do you remember how your Facebook feed looked like when you just opened  
your profile? This is the empty state before doing anything. It welcomes  
users and guides them towards taking the first action, the one that the  
platform is based on - adding friends. The button that says Next takes  
them to some friend suggestions. I would expect it to say something like  
Add friends, or See suggestions, or Look who else is here, but maybe Next  
is noncommittal, thus more appealing. I wonder if they tested it.  
www.facebook.com  
OkCupid’s inbox is one of the dating site’s most important pages. If it’s  
still empty, they encourage users to go ahead and explore the site. Cute  
illustrations that reflect the specific situation are a great way to improve  
the experience, and I would add a shortcut button to browse matches.  
www.okcupid.com  
Empty states | 127 tumblr doesn’t say that you have no notifi cations, instead it tells you  
when to come back and check. Not what isn’t there, but what will be there.  
www.tumblr.com  
On Amazon photos, if you haven’t created any albums yet, they don’t just say  
No Albums, but rather tell you how albums can help you \(organize and share  
your photos\) and provide a shortcut button with a call to action, so you can  
go ahead and create your first one.  
www.amazon.com  
Todoist is a task management  
tool. If you still haven’t posted  
a task for today, they not only  
tell you that once you do you’ll  
see it here, but also why it’s  
worthwhile to list your tasks -  
it gives you a clear view of the  
day ahead. The image strengthens  
this value, and the button is  
practical and down to business.  
www.todoist.com  
128 | Empty states Monday makes great use of empty states to show new users how the system  
works, and how they can make the best out of it\: Here you can easily find  
and manage tags \(instead of just No tags yet\); things you delete will  
be kept for 30 days \(instead of No deleted items\); you can temporarily  
archive folders \(instead of No archived items\); and how you receive and  
send personal notifications using @ \(instead of No notifi cations yet\).  
The images make things nicer too. Great job.

Empty states | 129 On the space where your future designs will appear, Canva puts their  
faith in you to create amazing things. They also refer users to the  
search bar to begin.

# 2\. Empty states of an empty cart and previous  
# orders  
Users have a variety of reasons to open their empty cart \(or basket or bag\).  
For example, if they thought they added an item to the cart by mistake and  
went to check if there’s anything there, or if they didn’t remember if they  
added an item or not and wanted to check, or if there was something in the  
cart but they removed it, leaving it empty.  
An empty cart is a terrible waste of real estate. I’ve seen quite a few like  
this one\:  
So how can you use this empty area? To motivate users to shop of course\:  
1\. 2. 3. Make it clear that the cart is empty, that it doesn’t have any items  
in it.  
Start an interesting and persuasive sales dialog. Try to be funny or  
exciting or make them curious, and best of all be all of them. As we  
saw in the first part of the book, when users are happy or excited they  
want to act. A combination of text and graphic works very well here.  
Direct your users to interesting parts of the shop, such as special  
offers, popular or new items, and so on.  
130 | Empty states 4\. You can also provide social proof or interesting statistics about  
other buyers or items, and only then direct the users to specific  
items in the shop.  
For example, on the site of a very famous chocolate shop, they write “Your  
shopping bag is empty”, and the rest of the page remains blank. Instead of  
this vacant lot, they could have started a sales pitch, and from there direct  
the curious users to the shop, while they have the urge to buy. For example\:  
Or\:  
In another online shop, selling health and beauty products, they didn’t  
even write that the bag was empty. The only thing users saw when they  
opened the bag for the first time was a space so empty that its cleanliness  
dazzled them. What could they have written? For example\:  
Empty states | 131 Of course, make sure that the offers don't look like products the users  
add to their basket. We're trying to motivate them, not to confuse them.  
You can combine this with social proof and write\:  
Items that have been purchased the most this week  
Or\: Items that someone else is looking at right this moment  
And under each title add photos of the products and a link to buy them.  
Many sites have a Previous Orders page, where you can browse the list  
of your past purchases, and sometimes even reorder one of them. Before  
purchasing the first item, users will of course see an empty state, but  
if you only write “There are no previous orders” you miss out on a sales  
opportunity, just as with the empty cart. Both the users' experience and  
their willingness to buy something will be dramatically enhanced if you  
write something substantial like\:  
132 | Empty states Examples of empty carts  
Belle and Sue is an Israeli fashion store. They first make it clear that  
your bag is empty, but they do it with a smile. They then motivate users  
to buy something and provide links, the first to the shop and others to  
specific items, with a title that thouches the shopping nerve.  
www.belleandsue.co.il \(Translated from Hebrew\)  
Busted Tees makes it clear that the shopping cart is empty, and refers  
users to the three most interesting pages in the shop.  
www.bustedtees.com  
American Eagle believes the new collections will peak users’ curiosity.  
www.ae.com  
Empty states | 133 Variety, promise of low prices, free delivery, social proof of best  
sellers and a helping hand - Book Depository successfully turned  
their basket into one that makes you want to set sail on your next  
reading adventure.  
www.bookdepository.com  
Society6, the art shop, has a different phrase for each empty state.  
This is the tooltip shown when the user hovers over the empty cart icon\:  
And this appears on the empty cart page\:  
www.society6.com  
134 | Empty states 3\. Empty states of search results  
When users are searching for something, but the system can’t find it,  
it returns an empty state. As developers put it\: “The query produced no  
results”, or “No results were found for the values entered”. But you must  
never write anything about the system to your users, nor about queries  
or values. Never mention any of these terms outside the confines of your  
office. Also, don’t ask them to perform another search, they simply won’t  
find it again. And of course, don’t leave it at “No results” or “No results  
were found”. Here also, instead of leaving your users at a dead end, you  
can direct them to the next step and keep them moving on your product.  
1\. Explain the situation. Tell your users clearly that you didn’t find  
what they were looking for. You might want to use empathy or even humor  
in the message.  
2\. Suggest one of the following\:  
a. Other ways to search for the same thing. Select the method that is most  
relevant to your type of content\:  
• Search by category  
• Search for a more general term  
• Search for a more specific term  
• Check your spelling  
• Try to use synonyms  
b. Things that are similar to what they searched for. Suggest items or  
links that are as close as possible\:  
• Other items by the same designer, writer, manufacturer, and so on \(for  
example, other Toyota cars\)  
• Other items with similar specifications but from other manufacturers  
\(for example, other cars from 2009\)  
• Other items of the same type or style or feature \(for example, other  
family cars\)  
c. Did you mean… If your search engine can find similar terms, like  
Google does, it’s worthwhile offering these results to your users and  
maybe save them the need to run another search.  
Empty states | 135 With each of these three options you need to really understand what the  
users are trying to accomplish by making their search, and then offer  
them something that gets them closer to that.  
# Examples of empty states of search results  
Zappos provides three search tips and a new search box below them. Very  
efficient.  
www.zappos.com  
Gmail offers a link to more search options. Clicking it opens an advanced  
search box.  
www.gmail.com  
136 | Empty states Google Maps suggests you’ll try a different area or add a missing place.  
With a link of course.  
Google Maps app  
Kickstarter suggests a correction \(did you mean something else?\) with a  
link, gives a search tip \(broaden your search\), and presents some popular  
projects in case you’re only browsing. Imagine that all of this helpful  
information was just - Sorry, no results...  
www.kickstarter.com  
When Ebay doesn’t find something, they offer users to save the search so  
they can get alerts about it in the future. What a great idea.

Empty states | 137 CHAPTER 10  
# PLACEHOLDERS  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
When you shouldn't use placeholders, and when  
you shouldn't  
6 types of placeholders and how to use them When a placeholder is needed, and more  
# important, when it isn’t  
Placeholders are the text you write inside a field, usually in a light  
shade, until the user starts to type. If everything works properly, the  
placeholder should either disappear or move as soon as the user places  
the cursor in the field.  
Since smartphones took over our lives and introduced the need to use space  
sparingly, the practice of writing the field labels inside the fields as  
placeholders became popular. For example\:  
This practice made its way to the desktop, even when there is no real space  
restriction. In fact, it has become so pervasive that sometimes designers  
are incapable of leaving the fields empty, and feel the need to fill them,  
even if it creates a weird redundancy\:  
Placeholders | 139 And even if it means overcoming the redundancy in creative ways…  
So first thing, here are two important principles\:  
1\. Separate the labels and the placeholders  
The label is the title or question that tells the users what information  
they are supposed to enter in the field. That is its only function,  
nothing else.  
If you put the label inside the field, you present users with a challenge  
to their short term memory. The label disappears when users start typing,  
and there is no way for them to go back and remember what they were  
supposed to provide here. The most important piece of information just  
isn’t there anymore. Granted that when talking about email and password  
fields the problem is less severe, because users know what is expected of  
them, but it hasn’t completely disappeared. For example, two fields were  
displayed in a login form. Force of habit made me type my email address  
in the first box, but then…  
Wait a minute, what was I supposed to provide in the first field? I had no  
idea and needed to delete the email address so that I could find out.  
One way of solving this problem is that as soon as the user places the  
cursor in the field, the placeholder doesn’t disappear but moves above or  
outside the field.  
140 | Placeholders Look what happens at eBay before placing the cursor in the field\:  
And after\:  
www.ebay.com  
Another option, which is always best \(unless you have an extreme shortage  
of space\), is to leave the labels as labels, outside the field, permanently  
displayed and in a contrasting color \(also good for accessibility! See  
Chapter 18\). The rule is simple\: making it obvious, eye catching, easy to  
understand and unchallenging will make it easier for all users. And if  
you have a problem of space, you can always place the labels above the  
fields not next to them.  
2\. Don’t add placeholders if there isn’t a good reason  
When users first see a form, it needs to look as simple as possible  
and provide the feeling that there’s not much work, or that it’s easy  
to fill out.  
Blocks of text immediately negate this feeling, because users need to  
read all those words, work in itself; and also a lot of text hints at a lot  
of work. Therefore in forms and other areas where users need to complete  
tasks, the rule is always, as few words as possible.  
Please go ahead and read the article "Placeholders in form fields are  
harmful" by Katie Sherwin \(Nielsen Norman Group\).  
Placeholders | 141 When you add both labels and placeholders to every field, you are actually  
doubling the amount of text on the form, and it looks busy, crowded and  
difficult to fill. For example, the following form is simple enough,  
but the placeholders make it look crowded, especially as they don’t add  
anything to what the labels provide, and thus don’t serve any purpose.  
This is totally unnecessary. Without placeholders, and with the right  
labels, the form seems as simple as it actually is\:  
Note that the empty fields really catch the eye and make you want to type  
something in them. If you want users to express themselves, give them the  
space to do it.  
142 | Placeholders In the article by Katie Sherwin I mentioned earlier, she writes\:  
"Eyetracking studies show that users’ eyes are drawn to empty fi elds.  
At the minimum, users will spend more time locating a non-empty fi eld.  
At the worst, they will overlook the fi eld completely - a potential  
business-killing disaster".  
In conclusion, don’t add placeholders just to fill up the space. Only add  
them when there is a good reason and they help you accomplish a specific  
goal. When you know what that goal is, you will be able to choose the  
placeholder that best suites it. In the following pages, I provide  
examples of the various types of placeholders and how to use them.  
# TIP  
# 18  
# Wait a minute, how many characters  
# did you say?  
It’s unadvisable to put hints or instructions as  
placeholders, because your users might need to refer to  
them while typing, and they’ll need to delete what they’ve  
already entered to see the advice.  
If you have instructions about a specific field, such as  
the rules for a password, restrictions on specific values,  
or a limitation on the number of characters, write these  
beneath the label, or in a tooltip, or in any other way you  
see fit \(see Chapter 14 for various possible ways\) - as long  
as users can come back and see the instructions at any time,  
even while typing.  
Placeholders | 143 When you should use placeholders  
If you shouldn’t put labels as placeholders, and you shouldn’t use  
placeholders as guidelines that the users need to remember, when should  
you use placeholders?  
1\. 2. Fields that you especially want your users to complete. For example,  
if you have a search box on your homepage that encourages users to  
explore the site. You usually find this at the top of the homepage,  
in its place of honor, with motivational text next to it, and a search  
button after it \(you’ll see examples soon\). Another very important  
field is the one that serves the main goal of the product. For example,  
the status field in Facebook or the profile fields on a dating site  
\(without statuses or full profiles there isn’t anything users can  
do on these sites\). In these important fields, putting a placeholder  
motivates users to action and moves things along.  
Fields that users might not understand, avoid or shy away from. For  
example, questions that can be answered in a number of ways, open  
questions that require consideration and time, questions where it  
is difficult to pin down the answer, questions requiring sensitive  
information, or questions where users might have other aversions  
to answering them \(examples coming right up\). In such fields it pays  
off to use placeholders that help users overcome the obstacles, and  
pave the way to filling in the fields with peace of mind.  
Another reason to add placeholders is simply to make your users laugh,  
and I’ll go into that in the last section of this chapter.  
144 | Placeholders Six types of placeholders and how to  
# use them  
# Type \#1\: Questions  
An interesting personal question in an especially important field, will  
awaken in your users the need to answer, drive up the traffic and increase  
user actions on your product. Ask a direct question \(preferably in the  
second-person\: you\) that interests them, that they want to answer, and  
that has a simple and short answer.  
# Examples  
Airbnb used to ask where you want to travel to. Show me the person who  
doesn’t have the answer to this question… Moreover, the question makes  
me want to take a quick peek and check what is available at my dream  
destination. I expect that this is exactly what Airbnb wanted to happen.  
www.airbnb.com \(a previous version\)  
Similarly, Booking.com asks\:  
www.booking.com  
Placeholders | 145 Fiverr asks in the field “What service are you looking for?” The text  
that precedes the field, together with the placeholder, make for a very  
practical call to action, a kind of a promise that everything can be done  
right here, just say what you need. The question also informs users what  
type of search terms will get the best results on this platform - services.  
By the way, they could also achieve that by using examples \(I’ll discuss  
that later in the chapter\).  
www.fiverr.com  
Udemy, the online courses platform, asks on their homepage\:  
www.udemy.com  
In all previous examples, the placeholder on the site’s homepage not  
only motivates users to find their personal answer and dive into the  
site, it also enables them to go directly to what interests them, instead  
of searching through a hierarchical set of menus.  
146 | Placeholders WeTransfer does the same thing with a question as a placeholder in its

Twitter asks “What’s happening?”. The question that you decide to put as a  
placeholder on your site, dictates the style of the answer you’ll receive.  
So it’s no wonder that Twitter became the preferred social media users  
check to get up-to-date reports from the field.  
www.twitter.com  
Facebook asks me what I’m thinking about. They don’t steer my thoughts  
towards something that’s happening outside, but towards something that  
is happening in my own head. And endless passing thoughts are exactly  
what you’ll find there.  
www.facebook.com  
Placeholders | 147 Type \#2\: Categories  
Defining categories helps reduce the choice range, enabling users to  
focus on the possibilities, and guiding them on the best way to use the  
field. As with question placeholders, categories also encourage users to  
enter something that personally interests them.  
# Examples  
SoundCloud, the audio platform, details what you can find here in four  
categories.  
www.soundcloud.com  
Hipmunk, the vacation planner, explains what you can search for in order  
to find a hotel.  
www.hipmunk.com  
SimplyHired, the job board, offers three categories for finding a job, and  
three for choosing its location.  
www.simplyhired.com  
Pixabay is a platform for sharing free stock photos. The placeholder suggests  
the best search categories, and below the field there are a few examples to  
make things even clearer. We’ll talk about using examples on the next page.  
www.pixabay.com  
148 | Placeholders Type \#3\: Examples  
Sometimes an example \(or even two or three, but no more\) will show your  
users the best way of using the field.  
# Examples  
Tailor Brands is a logo generator. The users are invited to describe their  
business, and the example, given as a placeholder, provides the type of  
required information\: size, industry, location and target audience.  
www.tailorbrands.com  
On the payment request form, PayPal’s example reminds you that a business  
note can also be personal.  
www.paypal.com  
Udemy, the online learning platform, uses examples to help instructors  
describe their course in a very practical way.  
www.udemy.com  
Placeholders | 149 Canva, the design platform, gives examples of design templates, which  
change every time you enter the site\:  
www.canva.com  
150 | Placeholders Type \#4\: Guiding sentence  
Open questions require users to think. But if there is something users  
don’t like doing, it is needing to think in the middle of a task. All they  
want to do is fill out the form and carry on.  
So, when you use open questions, the purpose of the placeholder is to give  
the users a lead and focus them on what’s important, thus making it easier  
for them and encouraging them to answer.  
# Examples  
On the RealMatch job boards, applicants can attach a cover letter to  
the resume. Writing a cover letter demands a lot of thought, and many  
candidates decide to skip this step, even though it can significantly  
increase their chance of receiving an answer from prospective employers.  
To help them start, the placeholder makes clear the purpose of the cover  
letter and provides the main topics the users can write about.  
RealMatch Job Boards  
When posting an experience to Airbnb, they introduce guiding placeholders  
to help you make it sound more attractive to guests.  
www.airbnb.com  
Placeholders | 151 Type \#5\: Remove obstacles  
If you know that users have an issue that prevents them from answering  
your question, the placeholder can appeal directly to this obstacle and  
try to remove it.  
# Example  
When filling out the profile on the OkCupid dating site, there are a number  
of open questions that are challenging to answer. Each question appears  
above the field, one of which asks\:  
www.okcupid.com  
Users need to enter here an area of interest that they think about a  
lot. But they might worry that most things they think about are not very  
interesting to potential partners \(too trivial, too heavy, a bit strange,  
not important enough or too important…\). This apprehension might cause  
them not to answer honestly, or even not to answer at all.  
So, the placeholder puts it this way\:  
The placeholder removes the obstacle by combining examples that are very  
important \(global warming\), not important \(lunch\) or very common \(next  
vacation\). And at the end they also add a calming phrase - exactly what  
the users need to hear so that they can let go and give an honest answer.  
And if we are already talking about OkCupid, I warmly recommend - even to  
the happily married among you - to visit the site and check out profile  
questions and placeholders. The microcopy around fields greatly reduces the  
confusion and concern and makes filling out the form simple and even fun.  
152 | Placeholders Type \#6\: It’s also possible just to have some fun  
Sometimes placeholders are simply designed to amuse users. That’s  
excellent, but remember that with forms the purpose is to let users  
complete them as fast as possible. So usually, that won’t be the place to  
joke with them, unless it’s an integral part of your voice and tone, and  
fits the atmosphere of the product. Or it might just be a fun form where  
no one is in a hurry.  
# Examples  
On the Trello sign up form the placeholders are meant to make users smile.  
Each time, a different fictional character from a TV series, film, book or  
video game, appears in the field.

# BUTTONS  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
Basic principles of writing converting buttons  
What click triggers are and how to use them Push the right buttons  
The importance of buttons cannot be overrated. So that users can get what  
they came for, and so that their browsing turns into your desired outcome,  
i.e. a conversion, users must click a button. The button is therefore the  
point when a decision becomes an action, so give it the time and thought  
it deserves \(and also time to test it if possible\). Don’t settle for generic  
terms that won’t move your users, that’s like slowing down just before the  
finish line.  
Before we dive into best practices of writing text that accompanies  
buttons, an important remark\:  
Test, test, test - Microcopy for buttons is full of surprises, and  
changing just one word on the button can increase or drop conversion  
rates significantly \(there are many examples of this on the Internet,  
just google “buttons copy”\). If you want to maximize your conversion rate,  
invest in A/B testing. It’s an investment that will pay off. Why do you  
still need best practices? So that you can select one of two excellent  
choices, instead of from two mediocre ones.  
# “What do I get” rather than “How do I get it”  
Generic words like Download, Search, Send, or Register don’t help users  
make a decision. When users get to one of these generic buttons, they need  
to balance up the pros and cons on their own, remember what they have read  
and understood so far, and decide for themselves if it’s worth it or not  
to click the button.  
Another problem with these generic words is that they usually emphasize  
what users have to do, the hard work.  
So what do you write instead? Michael Aagaard tested buttons for four  
years and came up with the following formula\:  
Value + Relevance = Conversions  
Buttons | 155 In the article “How to Write a Call-to-Action that Converts”, Aagaard writes  
that instead of writing on the button what the user does \(the action\), we  
need to explicitly write what the user gets \(the value\). For example, when  
he changed the copy on a button from Order information to Get information,  
conversions went up by nearly 40%!  
The reason for this is that the "order" button emphasizes what users have  
to do, not what they’re going to get. It doesn’t give them enough value to  
want to click the button.  
When the button focuses on the action and not the value, we are leaving it  
up to the users to draw conclusions, and there’s no way of knowing where  
their train of thought might take them. However, if you write the value  
on the button, you are offering the exact bottom line they’re looking for,  
and that’s a much bigger motivator.  
The second variable in Aagaard’s equation is relevance. Value by itself could  
still be too general, and Aagaard’s tests showed that buttons with specific  
microcopy relevant to a certain context, convert better. In other words, not  
only Download for free, but Download the guide for free, or even better\: Get  
your free guide. Here also, the right fine-tuning can increase conversion  
by dozens of percents. And if the length of the button copy seems daunting,  
you can relax. Buttons offering the relevant value raise conversions even if  
they are long. But don’t just take my word for it, check it out for yourself.  
Heads up\: not every button on your product needs to provide significant value.  
When I talk about value I mean only those buttons that generate conversions  
or an action that’s important for you, such as signing up, generating leads  
or downloading. And if the most important action on your product is, for  
example, search, comment, or watching a sales video - then those are the  
buttons you should invest in.  
However, most of the button microcopy on your product will probably be  
functional guidelines, that can remain - and it’s even best that they  
remain - standard, obvious and well known to users\: Continue, Add to  
basket, Chat with us, Pay securely, Edit, Share, Compose, Upload, Save,  
and so on.  
156 | Buttons Example  
Three different digital invoicing systems offer a 30-day free trial.  
Their buttons are slightly different from one another\:  
Button on the homepage leading to  
the sign up form for the free trial  
Button at the end of the sign up  
form for the free trial  
# 1  
# 2  
# 3  
In the first system \(row 1\), both buttons refer to the action that users need  
to take, and neither of them provides the value that makes it worthwhile  
to click the button \(unless one of your hobbies is creating accounts all  
over the Internet\). There’s also no relevancy, both buttons are completely  
generic, and you could put them exactly as they appear here on any other  
digital product - and they’ll fit in just fine.  
In systems 2 and 3 \(rows 2 and 3\), the buttons on the homepage \(left column\)  
do indeed talk about the action users need to take, but immediately remind  
them of the value\: a 30-day free trial. However, as these buttons appear on  
the homepage, maybe it would have been better to write only the value\: Get  
a 30-day free trial, and not even mention the sign up process, which might  
sound complicated and deter users from clicking the button.  
If we wrote on the homepage button the benefit of a 30-day free trial, what  
should the button at the end of the form say \(right column\)? The final value,  
creating invoices. In system 3 \(row 3, right column\), they indeed provided  
a similar value, Start using the system, but the relevancy is only partial  
here, as this button could actually fit into any system, and it still hints  
at the hard work users have to do and not what they get as a result of that  
work. A more relevant phrasing is\: Start creating digital invoices.  
Buttons | 157 More examples  
unbounce specializes in building landing pages optimized for  
conversion.They have buttons with loads of values. They seem long and  
as a writer you might feel that you want to get rid of quite a lot of  
words, but to the users they deliver important information, and no one  
said that buttons need to be short.  
www.unbounce.com  
# With purchase buttons, the more mundane -  
# the better  
Add to cart means add the item to the cart, and that’s it. Users  
expect that adding an item to their cart will only save it for  
future consideration or purchase. They don’t intend to commit to  
it just yet and begin the payment process. Anything else you write  
will only increase users' level of uncertainty. For example, I want  
this, I pick this, or any similar expression will immediately raise  
unnecessary doubts about what does this button actually do and  
where will it take me.  
The checkout button should also be clear \(at most it can be Secured  
checkout or Checkout securely, as we'll see on Chapter 16\), so that  
only users who really want to proceed to payment will click on it.  
This is also true for that final button\: Confirm payment, Place order,  
or Submit purchase.  
Further more, UniqUI’s research \(in Hebrew\) found that deviations  
from the standard process of purchasing lower conversion rates. So  
it's really not the time and place to reinvent the wheel.

Buttons | 159 TIP  
# 19  
# Remind me why I wanted to sign up  
The Sign up button at the end of the sign up form can be much  
more interesting and motivating if you ask yourself how  
users benefit from signing up, or what they can start doing  
afterwards. Thus instead of writing only Sign up, you can  
write Sign up and - start saving recipes, start learning  
French, create a professional logo, see jobs that suit you,  
and so on.  
Besides, if those who sign up receive a discount or gift, you  
can write it on the button. Get free credit, or Get 25% off!  
Buttons like these transfer the weight from the registration  
to the reason for registering, and can be very effective.  
# TIP  
# 20  
# What on earth am I cancelling?  
Other buttons that need special attention are the cancel action  
buttons. These buttons can be really confusing. For example\:  
Cancel Undo  
What is cancelled by the Cancel button, the action or the  
cancellation request?  
In such cases, instead of Undo and Cancel, it’s better to use the  
words Yes and No, and add a word or two to make it conclusive.  
For example\:  
www.eventbrite.com  
160 | Buttons Click Triggers - the last minute message that  
# tips the scale  
Joanna Wiebe shows in Buttons and Click-Boosting Calls to Action how  
short messages written next to the button can significantly increase  
conversions just like the main microcopy on the button. She calls these  
short sentences click triggers.  
The goal of click triggers is to tell users exactly those words required  
to tip the scale at the split second it takes for the decision to be  
taken. They are supposed to get users to respond immediately and turn  
intention into action.  
Next to \(or beneath or above\) every button important for you, it’s  
worthwhile writing at least one click trigger, whether it’s signing up  
for a newsletter, signing up for the product, watching a demo video or  
purchasing something.  
Just like the microcopy on the button, click triggers can also remind  
users about the value they’ll get if they click. But they can also work in  
another very interesting way\: remove concerns that accompany clicking  
and pave the way to make it happen.  
You should carefully choose the click trigger based on the objectives  
of your users on the product and according to the things that deter  
them most. Even if you have already addressed these issues in other  
places on the product, a short reminder next to the button can create  
the desired response \(learn more about alleviating concerns on  
Chapter 16\).  
If necessary you can even write 2-3 click triggers, but don’t overdo it\:  
carefully select those that are the most influential, and as usual, run  
A/B testing.  
Buttons | 161 Examples  
Intercom’s click triggers are great. The three of them together form an  
image of an easy to use product that you can only benefit from trying.  
Didn’t like it? You can cancel without losing time or money.  
www.intercom.com  
Booking.com excels in writing effective click triggers. They use loads  
of social proofs to show the value of the room, and especially to induce  
a sense of urgency. When users are deliberating on whether to click the  
button or not, the social proof that the hotel is well liked by others can  
be a trigger, and it also provides the feeling that if they don’t book now  
they’ll lose the room.  
www.booking.com  
Similarly, when pondering whether to book a home on Airbnb, there are two  
click triggers beneath the button\: the first alleviates a concern, and the  
second does the opposite.  
www.airbnb.com  
162 | Buttons Showpo does the same with fashion items - you snooze, you lose\:  
www.showpo.com  
Society6 alleviates a major concern of shoppers - if I don’t like the  
product I bought, can I return it? Will you give me a hard time returning  
it? The answer is no, and when users know that, it’s much easier for them  
to continue to checkout. In the worst-case scenario, they’ll easily return  
the product, no big deal.  
www.society6.com  
High ratings are a common social proof, and you can use them as click  
triggers too. This is how it’s done on Download.

404 ERROR\:  
PAGE NOT FOUND  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
4 things every 404 page needs to include  
Ideas for perfectly branded 404 pages Black holes on the Internet  
Renny Gleeson summarized his very short TED lecture on 404 pages \(“404,  
the story of a page not found”\) thus\:  
A simple mistake can tell me what you’re not,  
or it can remind me of why I should love you.  
Users encounter a 404 page when searching for one that no longer exists  
on your site \(or that was never there in the first place\). This might happen  
if you leave a link somewhere on your site or the Internet to a page that  
no longer exists, or its address has changed; and it can also occur because  
users typed a wrong URL.  
Ideally, your users are not supposed to see 404s, or at least only see  
them rarely. However, it is still an important page. If the users got here  
from the Google search results page or from another site that referred to  
you, and found only this\:  
404 error\: Page Not Found  
they will immediately hit “back”, and you lost them. The chances they’ll  
explore other pages on your site are zero. They have no idea how to continue  
from here, and they have no good reason to try. Moreover, as Gleeson said,  
the 404 page tells users a lot about your brand. For example, how you deal  
with your own mistakes, how you deal with user errors, and how you treat  
users when they encounter a problem or are disappointed.  
The standard message as above shows that the writers of the page did not  
understand either the users or the problem \(if someone even gave it some  
attention\). Technically, such a message does not help users understand  
what went wrong, nor help them get to where they want to go. It’s a dead  
end. Even emotionally, it doesn’t show any empathy for the disappointment  
felt by users because they couldn’t find what they were looking for.  
It’s important to understand that the design of a 404 page is significant,  
but it’s not enough. An image without microcopy might raise a smile, but  
won’t help users get to where they want to go.  
404 Error\: page not found | 165 How to write microcopy for a 404 page  
1\. Explain to the users what happened and how they ended up here.  
Remember that they don’t know what a 404 is. In fact, you don’t even need  
to mention the number 404 or the word error, just explain in simple  
words, without technical jargon, that the page wasn’t found or is no  
longer here \(if your users are digital savvy, it's worth mentioning the  
term 404, because they probably understand it, but it still shouldn't be  
the main message\).  
2\. Show empathy.  
Because users are disappointed that they didn’t find what they were  
looking for, and sometimes it’s our fault, it’s worthwhile to show empathy,  
that is add a word or sentence that demonstrates to the users that you  
can relate to the way they are feeling right now. You can apologize and  
you can reflect their feelings \(many examples coming up soon\).  
3\. Point to the way out. It’s worthwhile to put one or more of the following\:  
• Links to central areas of the site, to categories that lots of people  
search for, or pages that you want to direct users to.  
• A search field  
• A link to the homepage  
• If the main menu appears on the 404 page, turn the users’ attention to  
it either with words or a visual sign, and don’t count on them seeing  
and understanding that it’s their way out.  
4\. A 404 page can, but doesn’t have to, include one of the following\:  
• A great design  
• Humor that will turn the negative experience into a positive one  
\(but be careful not to laugh at users when they are confused\).  
• Provide a way they can report the broken link, something along the  
lines of\: “If you got here from another site, we’d appreciate it if  
you told us from where so that we can fi x it and save others from  
ending up here". Then add a link to the Contact page or a special  
support form dedicated to this purpose.  
• List the contact details of customer service and support.  
166 | 404 Error\: page not found Put things into perspective  
There are sites that invest a lot on their 404 page. Google developed a  
game for Android's 404 page \(see the screenshot below\), and on Romain  
Brasier’s site \(www.romainbrasier.fr\), there’s a game where you need to  
save 404 lemmings. In the world of microcopy and design, it seems as if  
more has been written about 404s than any other page, and there are dozens  
of articles of the type “The 30 best 404 pages ever”.  
But let’s be honest, we are the people who enjoy it most, our users only  
rarely get to see the page, and then they don’t stay around but move forward  
towards whatever they were looking for in the first place.  
It’s important that the page creates engagement and a desire to continue  
from there to the rest of the site. But it’s even more important that the  
page provides full details and the required service. There's no need to  
go overborad\: a simple design or funny picture, clear text with a touch of  
humor, and three links to central areas on the site, will do a great job.  
Mind you - Successful 404 pages have provided their owners with a great  
marketing service, because users shared them. Romain Brasier is one  
example, as is the Nosh video that went viral \(look for "Nosh 404" on  
YouTube\). So if the purpose of your 404 is sales, go for it and invest!  
www.android.com  
404 Error\: page not found | 167 Examples  
The 404 of the Belle and Sue Israeli fashion shop does not include any  
design, but it’s very funny. It reflects the frustration of users, but also  
puts things into perspective, using lots of humor. It simply states that  
there’s a problem \(users are not interested in the technical details of  
the problem\), and at the end of the message, ways to exit to other pages on  
the site are offered. Simply lovely.  
www.belleandsue.co.il \(Translated from Hebrew\)  
On this simple but beautiful 404 page by Spotify, they name a record  
\(that’s actually spinning on the right\) with a title that reflects  
disappointment. They also explain what happened in everyday words, and  
offer links to FAQ, community and back. The link GO BACK takes users to  
the homepage, so it would have been better to say exactly that, since they  
might have arrived here from somewhere else.  
www.spotify.com  
168 | 404 Error\: page not found RSPCA, the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, have a  
funny copy describing what happened to the page \(a dog ran away with it and  
buried it in the yard, of course\), and they give some useful and important  
links, plus an extra one for further searching in the help center. Super  
cute and useful, and delivers the society’s spirit.  
www.rspca.org.uk  
# Ideas\: What else can you put in a 404 apart  
# from microcopy  
• Funny pictures  
• Graphics that express the frustration the user feels  
• Animation  
• An explanation, in the voice and tone of your brand, that explains to  
the user why the page is missing  
• Excerpts from songs or films  
• YouTube videos  
404 Error\: page not found | 169 The Israeli UX studio, Uniq UI, explains the problem beautifully, using  
simple words \(the term 404 is hinted at for those that understand it\),  
takes full responsibility for the problem, and at the end offers a few  
links as the way out.  
www.uniqui.co.il \(Translated from Hebrew\)  
170 | 404 Error\: page not found Brand content in 404 pages  
In the quote that opened this chapter, Gleeson says that the 404 is also  
an opportunity to remind users why they love the brand, why they are here.  
In other words, the page is not only there to help users recover from the  
error, but is also an opportunity to engage them. To do this, I recommend  
including on your 404 page ideas taken from the content of your brand. For  
example, to explain the missing page, use reasons connected to what the  
brand does, using terminology from relevant content.  
# Examples  
Every time we see a 404 on the IMDB database of cinema and television, it  
provides a different movie “quote” - there are about 15 of these.  
www.imdb.com  
TripAdvisor tells us that the page we are looking for has gone on vacation,  
and so should we.

WAITING TIME  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
Why it’s important to invest in the waiting time  
experience  
Some ideas on how to pass the time with your users Quality time with your users  
The waiting time is the period it takes a system to load, process data,  
search, download a file, and so on. And if you are asking yourself why  
you need to deal with such menial pursuits, then a great article \(only  
in Hebrew for now\) by Tal Mishaly, the UX professional consultant for  
this book, throws some light on this. One fascinating insight from his  
research on user experience versus usability, is that animation, changing  
text, or a progress bar all shorten the perceived time that passes for the  
user. In other words, if there is something that keeps users busy while  
waiting, something to read, look at or follow, time passes quicker, and  
they perceive the waiting period as being shorter than it really is.  
Another reason is that you have a few moments where the user is simply  
staring at the screen and waiting. Why not use this time to impart  
something wise, heartwarming or branded? With minimum investment you  
can prepare another surprise for your users that shows you thought about  
them and that they are important to you. These small things make all the  
difference!  
It’s important to make clear that you can use only graphics, without  
a single word, during this waiting time. So if you are able to invest  
in a fun animation - that’s great. But words need much less design and  
development, thus providing a quicker and cheaper solution that works  
just as well.  
So what text can you display during waiting times to make it appear to go  
a bit faster, and change it from a waste of time into time to engage with  
your users? Choose one or more of the following.

# is doing for them  
Users follow the progress of whatever is happening, and that helps  
pass the time, makes them feel they are taking part in the process, and  
also builds expectation about what the result will be when the process  
completes. As we’ll soon see, this works even if the stages aren’t real…

Tailor Brands give their users a real sense that a lot of thought was  
invested in their logo and products design. I assume they want to  
emphasize that even though the process is automatic, it is well thought,  
so that the result looks like it was designed by a real designer.

PART 3\:  
USABILITY How to prevent and smooth out frictions  
Our users need very little reason to abandon the process. It’s enough that  
they hit a single field that is not entirely clear on how to fill it, a task  
that looks too much like hard work, the smallest concern regarding their  
privacy, or a question for which they found no answer. There are users  
that give up at the first bump in the road or the first sign of any friction.  
Good microcopy appears anywhere friction might occur, and provides  
an immediate solution. Sometimes it can even prevent the friction  
from the start.  
In the previous part of the book, we spoke mainly about the microcopy that  
is shown before or after a user's action. In part 3 we’ll talk about the  
microcopy that accompanies their actions so as to guide them and make the  
task simpler and quicker. The goal is to enable users to successfully and  
quickly complete the task - both for them and for us.

USABILITY\:  
BASIC PRINCIPLES

Be succinct  
4 ways of introducing microcopy in forms  
How to know where microcopy is needed The fewer words the better, but...  
With messages and calls to action, discussed in previous chapters, the  
purpose of the microcopy was mainly to create or enrich the emotional  
experience and engagement of the users. Now, once you have got them to act,  
and they have started the process on the website, app or complex system  
\(such as signing up, ordering something or starting a new project\), the  
purpose of microcopy changes. Now it needs to increase usability and  
help users avoid friction, so that they finish the process quickly and  
easily.  
Therefore, the focus moves from the emotional experience you created for  
your users, to enhancing clarity and practicality. Here good service is  
not measured by how pleasant it is \(and it must, of course, stay pleasant\),  
but by how much you helped your users complete the task with minimum  
effort \(or thinking, as Steve Krug put it\) on their part.  
It doesn’t mean that you go back to writing like a lawyer in an aloof and  
condescending manner, most certainly not. It does mean that you write  
microcopy only when it’s needed and in as few words as possible. It also  
means that as long as your users are trying to complete the task, and as  
long as you want them to progress from control to control until they hit  
the Submit button, don’t be too clever or complicate things.  
Say only what is required, precisely, concisely and using simple  
language.  
Microcopy and usability | 183 In the following real-life example, it looks like the writers went out of  
their way to provide a good service, but took the wrong turn and made the most  
simple and standard form into something complicated, even daunting.  
Most of the explanations are totally unnecessary, and those that are  
required should be much shorter. It’s true that you need to write in a  
personable way, but in such practical forms, it’s important to provide  
the information in the most intelligible and clear way, avoiding long  
sentences.  
For example, instead of\: Must be between 5 and 40 characters  
Write simply\: 5-40 characters  
So before stacking your interface with words, ask yourself\:  
1\. Are they really necessary?  
2\. How can you phrase it in as few words as possible?  
184 | Microcopy and usability Check your UX  
If you find yourself explaining a lot of things using many words,  
or can't find the right words, you might have a UX problem. A good  
interface should have its UX designed so that it motivates and is  
self-explanatory. The microcopy is only supposed to support the  
process and clear up any remaining issues. If you feel that the UI is  
overloaded with words, I highly recommend that you ask the UX team to  
find a creative solution.  
# On the other hand, don’t hesitate to give a  
# helping hand where needed  
Being succinct is essential, but the question isn’t how much microcopy to add  
to a form, but\: do users need help? If the answer is yes - go ahead and add  
written guidance.  
In a great talk by Sara Walsh she shows how they doubled the number of  
words in a form on Capital One's website, giving up white spaces and  
adding assistive copy around the fields, which resulted in tripling the  
form completion rate from 26% to 92% \(watch “Don’t forget your online  
forms” on YouTube\).  
If you identify a place on your form where users might go astray, make a  
mistake or feel unsecure - don’t hesitate to write down the answer to the  
question nagging them, or the reassuring words they need at this point.  
Never skip on giving important explanations, in order not to overburden  
the users. On the contrary, they’ll be happy to get your support at those  
friction points and be able to easily find what they are looking for,  
without contacting support or giving up on doing what they came for.  
As we saw earlier, the instructions should of course be as short and concise  
as possible, the kind that offers maximum information with the fewest  
words. You can also keep the instructions hidden until the exact moment  
they are needed, or present them in various ways according to context.  
Microcopy and usability | 185 4 ways of introducing microcopy  
# in forms  
1\. Static  
The assistive microcopy is permanently shown on screen, without  
appearing, moving or vanishing. It’s just always present, accessible and  
out there all along, in front or beside the control.  
Main advantage\: users can’t miss it.  
Main disadvantage\: might overload the form’s visibility.  
Best for\: When the instruction is critical for the users to understand  
how to take action, and you would like to make sure they don’t miss it.  
Munchery uses static microcopy to notify users about an irreversible  
action\:  
www.munchery.com  
Notice that these instructions should be placed in front of the field to  
meet microcopy accessibility requirements \(see chapter 18\).  
2\. Shows up on demand  
Microcopy that appears \(usually as a tooltip\) when the user clicks an icon  
\(?,!,i\) or hover on top of it or click a link.  
Main advantage\: always easily accessible for everyone, but doesn’t  
burden those who are already familiar with the form.  
Main disadvantage\: users might not click on it, and miss important  
186 | Microcopy and usability information. Therefore, I recommend that important explanations are  
displayed next to the control and not hidden in a tooltip \(unless it  
automatically appears, as we shall soon see\).  
Best for\:  
a. When there’s a lot of information or instructions to present that  
might create a visual overload.  
b. Giving the user background information about the action that might  
direct them or show the value of taking the action.  
c. Frequently taken actions, so that on the second or third time users  
can complete it without referring to the information icon. Thus, new  
users get the highly accessible information they need, while veterans  
can move swiftly along without stopping, but can still refer to it  
should the need re-arise.  
This tooltip appears when hovering over the ‘?’ icon in Booking.com,  
a website that is very rich with information and instructions. The  
tooltip’s aim is to explain why they ask for such private information  
\(see also Chapter 16\).  
www.booking.com  
Microcopy and usability | 187 This is Facebook’s UI for creating ads. They placed an ‘i’ icon next to  
each control, which is a lot, but the icons don’t get in the way. On the  
contrary, they deliver accurate, accessible and helpful guidance for  
every term, helping users make the right decisions.  
www.facebook.com  
We’ll see many more examples of explanatory and assistive tooltips in  
the following chapters.  
3\. Appears automatically  
The microcopy automatically appears exactly when the users need it \(i.e.  
when the cursor is in the field, and the field is in focus\), and stays visible  
as long as they need it. Once users move on in the form - it disappears,  
and a new guidance will replace it according to where the focus is.  
188 | Microcopy and usability Main advantages\: always accessible when needed, doesn’t burden the form,  
almost no chance of instructions being overlooked.  
Main disadvantage\: will appear again and again, even for returning  
users who don’t need it anymore.  
Best for\:  
a. When there is a lot of information or instructions that might create a  
visual overload and thus should better be hidden.  
b. One-time actions, like setting up an online store, creating an account,  
starting a crowdfunding campaign, or booking a guided tour to Papua New  
Guinea.  
c. When you want to give users the feeling they are closely accompanied  
throughout the process, for instance when making financial actions,  
enrolling in an academic institution or making an expensive purchase.  
d. Important and infrequent actions, like buying airline tickets.  
This tooltip, from Wizzair’s website, appears automatically when the  
password field is in focus, and stays with you until a valid password is  
created\:  
www.wizzair.com  
They could have written it much shorter though\:  
\* 7-16 characters  
\* Must contain numbers and letters  
\* No special characters  
Microcopy and usability | 189 This excellent tooltip appears automatically when placing the cursor  
in the Alt field on Wix’s blog platform, to explain what Alt is for and  
encourage adding one\:  
www.wix.com  
By the way, it doesn’t have to be a tooltip. These screenshots are  
from Zeplin’s sign up. The copy on the right automatically appears when  
the email field is in focus\:  
And when you move on to the username field\:  
www.zeplin.io  
190 | Microcopy and usability4\. Placeholder  
As we saw in Chapter 10, placeholders are usually written in a lighter  
shade in the field, and disappear when the field comes into focus.  
Main advantage\: it will not be missed.  
Main disadvantage\: it disappears and the user cannot see the  
information on demand.  
Best for\:  
a. Short instructions.  
b. When there’s no risk the users might want to see the information again  
once the placeholder disappears.  
c. Giving the users a thread or a short leading phrase to start with.  
d. Giving the users a short example on how to correctly fill in the field.  
See many examples and more ways to use placeholders on Chapter 10.  
Of course, don’t use all 4 ways in one form; consistency is, as you know, a  
virtue. Use each method appropriately to meet your users’ needs, to make  
simple relaxing forms that are easy to use.  
Microcopy and usability | 191 TIP  
# 21  
# \(?\) or \(!\) or \(i\) or maybe a link?  
When should you use an exclamation mark or a question mark  
icon? Maybe it’s better to create a short link? It’s not clear  
cut, but the answer lies within the minds of your users.  
If you think \(or discovered in usability tests\) that they’ll  
ask a relatively common question - such as what do you mean,  
what does that do, why do you want this piece of information  
- put a question mark icon, that will resonate their question  
and provide a hint that it is answered here.  
If a specific question might arise - such as how was that  
amount calculated, or where do I find the data you are asking  
me to provide - it is certainly possible to provide a text  
link next to the relevant field, in the way your users would  
phrase it. For example, How did we calculate that or Where  
should I check . The question must be short and simple \(there  
are many examples in the following chapters\).  
You can put the exclamation mark or i icon when you want to  
provide information that doesn't necessarily answer a user’s  
question, but rather adds background or other important  
details.  
But, as I said, it’s not clear cut. If you are debating which  
is more appropriate, it’s probably borderline and whichever  
you choose won’t affect things much. Most important is that  
the microcopy is efficient, simple and really smooths out  
friction.  
192 | Microcopy and usability How to know where microcopy is needed  
In those places where friction may occur between users and the  
interface, that’s where you need microcopy. Friction could be caused  
by a delay, misunderstanding, concern or error. The question is of  
course how to know where potential friction might occur and to solve  
or prevent it in advance.  
In the book Web Form Design by Luke Wroblewski \(Rosenfeld Media, 2008\),  
he provides a variety of ways to find weak spots in forms. Following are  
the three most relevant to microcopy.  
# Usability tests  
Watch the recordings \(paying attention to the words users use\) and write  
down where users were delayed, hesitated or became stuck, and what was  
it that they didn’t understand in each place. Sometimes, all it takes to  
solve a delay is a few words of explanation.  
For example, if you have a control that offers auto-complete and the user  
has to select one of the values from the list, but you see in the tests that  
users prefer to finish typing the full name and not to select from the  
list, it’s a good idea to add a short instruction under the field and make  
it clearer.  
Of course it’s preferable to allow users to type in the full name if that’s  
what they want, but when there’s no other choice, microcopy can help.  
Microcopy and usability | 193 Customer support reps  
Ask your online customer support team what are the most frequent  
questions customers have, and why they feel they need to turn to support.  
You’ll discover where in the process customers have problems and need  
help, and what exactly is difficult for them. These weak spots either need  
a UX repair or the help of microcopy.  
For example, if a lot of users turn to support during the payment process,  
and request to complete the purchase on the phone, it might be that they are  
afraid that the online payment is not secured enough. In such cases, it’s  
worthwhile emphasizing in a variety of places and ways that the payment  
is secured, and maybe even point out what kind of payment security you  
offer and how good it really is \(see examples in Chapter 16\).  
# Monitoring and analysis tools  
Web analytics tools, such as heatmaps, can show you where users abandoned  
the task, what the last thing was that they tried to do, where many error  
messages were displayed, and other important data that will highlight  
those squeaky hinges that you can grease with microcopy.  
For example, if you discover that users skip the date of birth field,  
or get errors because they didn’t fill it, it’s probable that they don’t  
understand why you want this private information. It’s recommended that  
you mark that field as mandatory and add a short explanation offering a  
convincing reason \(i.e. required by law, see examples in Chapter 16\).  
In the next few chapters I will list a few weak points you can find  
in almost any form. For each item I’ll write about microcopy that can  
fortify this weak point, enhance usability and increase completion  
and conversion rates.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED  
AND KNOWLEDGE  
GAPS BRIDGED  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
4 common questions that microcopy needs to answer Remove the curse of knowledge  
Practically all digital processes arouse some sense of uncertainty  
within users. Someone else designed this process for them, and they are  
completing it in the belief that it will benefit them, or at least won’t  
cause any trouble. We, who designed the process, see the full picture, but  
users only see a few steps ahead. So when they don’t understand a term and  
can’t find an explanation for it, or they don’t understand how to use the  
interface, this fundamental uncertainty increases, and they lose their  
confidence in the process, and in us.  
Microcopy can offer users an immediate and accessible answer to any  
question they might have, and thus create a feeling of certainty. The copy  
doesn’t only answer the question, it also shows users that we take them  
into consideration and that their question is legitimate, and thus they  
can trust us.  
The difficulty for microcopy writers stems from what is known as the  
Curse of Knowledge. This is the inability of a person who already has  
some knowledge to see things from the point of view of someone who lacks  
that knowledge. When you write microcopy you know everything about  
the digital product that you are writing for, the subject matter, the  
specific task, and also about interfaces in general. Things that seem to  
you well known and obvious, might be new and incomprehensible to your  
users. To identify those places where users might ask What’s that? or  
What does that do? or How do I use that? you need to take a fresh look at  
the process, and it is also well advised to use the resources discussed  
in the previous chapter \(usability tests, customer support reps and  
analytical tools\).  
This chapter shows some common questions that users might ask. Even  
before the usability tests, try to look at the process through the eyes of  
completely new users, identify those places where questions may arise,  
and write microcopy that answers them.  
Questions and knowledge gaps | 197 Question \#1\: What’s that?  
a. Go over the process and look for internal technical terms and for terms  
that might be unusual or new in the eyes of the users, making them ask  
What’s that?  
b. For every such term, check if you can replace it with simpler words.  
c. If you can’t simplify the term, add microcopy with an explanation.  
# Examples  
Commonwealth Bank’s customers are not used to being asked to provide  
their credit card pin code. This might lead to them not understanding the  
banking term “Card PIN”. For that reason, a clear explanation is provided  
right by the field. It would have been better to put a question mark icon,  
because the explanation answers the question What’s that? \(see tip 21\).  
www.commbank.com.au  
When you name different features in your product, you actually create a  
new in-product convention that users might not understand. They might  
also fail to see what value it can give them. If you want users to use it -  
explain what it means, and what is it good for. Monday, the team-project  
management tool, does it with colorful tooltips.  
www.monday.com  
198 | Questions and knowledge gaps Golan Telecom is an Israeli mobile operator. When a user orders a new  
line, they can order “Numbers Sequence”. But what’s numbers sequence?  
Hovering above the question mark icon displays the explanation - to buy a  
few sim cards that have sequential numbers. It’s worth mentioning that if  
Golan Telecom really wants to sell sequential numbers, and I guess they  
do, they should phrase the explanation as a call to action. For example,  
“Order more than one sim card and get sequential numbers”.  
www.golantelecom.co.il  
Target shows a permanent link that leads  
to an explanation about the GiftNow  
feature.  
www.target.com  
Like with placeholders, sometimes an example is the best way to explain a  
complex idea. On Typeform, the questionnaire creator, they explain every  
kind of question available using an example in a tooltip. It clarifies the  
terms and makes it very easy for users to choose the one they need.  
www.typeform.com  
Questions and knowledge gaps | 199 Airbnb answer common questions in advance and explain the different  
elements of the payment in a simple, relatable way. I find the term one-  
time, together with the specification of what they’re going to do with the  
fees, and most importantly - what’s in it for the users - reassuring and  
alleviates objections.  
www.airbnb.com  
When you show users a number that’s an outcome of a calculation you  
made, consider sharing how you arrived at this outcome. Airbnb offers  
a tooltip with a breakdown of the base price. Transparency is one of the  
most reassuring practices.  
www.airbnb.com  
200 | Questions and knowledge gaps eBay tells users how they estimate the delivery date\:  
www.ebay.com  
A clarification of professional terms can help users choose between  
various options. In the following example, the icon shop The Noun Project  
gives a super-useful explanation for each file format, detailing what  
they’re good for and what are their pros and cons, thus helping users  
decide which format to download.  
www.thenounproject.com  
Anyway, the question mark icon doesn’t imply that there’s useful  
information inside, and instead I would write a permanent link such as  
What’s the difference, or How do I choose, or What are PNG and SVG. I also  
think that the first two lines in the tooltip are redundant, since the UI  
is self-explanatory.  
Questions and knowledge gaps | 201 Question \#2\: What does that do?  
When you have an on/off switch \(toggle\) or check box, and if the action  
is not entirely obvious, write near the control what happens, or doesn’t  
happen, when you turn it on or off. If necessary, explain to the users the  
advantages and disadvantages of turning it on or off.  
Also, if you have a special interest in making users use the feature,  
phrase your explanation as a call to action in an attractive, interesting  
way rather than using a neutral-technical tone.  
# Examples  
When YouTube launched the Autoplay feature, they used to have an i icon  
right next to the switch, that when hovered over answered the question  
What does that do? Because YouTube has a clear interest in us using this  
feature to increase the number of views, it would have been better if  
they worded the explanation more actively. For example, Turn this on to  
automatically play the next suggested video.  
www.youtube.com \(a previous version\)  
What will happen if you click Save this seller? How will that help you?  
eBay presents the answers in a tooltip. But will users know they can  
hover to find more info, or would it be better to add a tiny help icon?  
www.ebay.com  
202 | Questions and knowledge gaps Toshl, the budgeting app, has monsters with great humor, but not all users  
like their finances served with a dose of laughter \(see Chapter 1 about how  
to use humor in your microcopy\). For them, there’s a switch that turns the  
monsters into the most politically correct creatures.  
Toshle app  
Notica, an app that processes and stores photos as visual notes, explains  
to the user all the consequences of turning on or off the high resolution  
feature. The explanation is a bit long, but the information is important  
for users that invest time and effort in organizing their photos, and  
enables them to make a decision most suitable to their individual needs.  
Notica app  
In WhatsApp, even though the feature has a simple and clear label, it  
still needs the sentence underneath. This explains precisely what is  
included in “incoming media” and where and when is it saved.  
WhatsApp app  
Questions and knowledge gaps | 203 Question \#3\: Where can I find this?  
On forms where users are requested to supply specific information \(such  
as finding what class driving license you have, your account number on  
your utility bill, and so on\), it is a good idea to explain in a clear  
manner next to the field how to find this information, and even accompany  
it with a picture highlighting the exact location.  
If the value includes dashes or slashes, or a combination of letters  
and numbers, mention if they need to be typed in or not, in what order  
and more \(or even arrange the input field as a number of boxes that  
skips the symbols\).  
# Example  
When registering an HP laptop, you need to provide the product name or  
number. The form provides a link saying\: “How do I fi nd my product name/  
number?” It opens in a new window, there they have a video and many other  
ways the user can find the number.  
Note that they could use fewer words\: the instruction "Enter the..." isn't  
necessary because the field label and the placeholder are doing a great  
job, and the link could be shorter too\: "Where do I find it?"  
register.hp.com  
204 | Questions and knowledge gaps Similarly, when Monday asks for the board ID, they provide an explanation  
both for what’s an ID and where to find it.  
www.monday.com  
# TIP  
# 22  
# You can select more than one option  
As you know, radio buttons are used when only one option  
is possible, whereas check boxes are used for multiple  
selection. But the general public doesn’t necessarily know  
that. It might be that most users don’t even notice that there  
are two type of selection controls. Therefore, when it’s  
possible to select more than one option, it’s worthwhile  
pointing that out explicitly.  
Questions and knowledge gaps | 205 Question \#4\: How do I use that?  
In theory, the user experience should be self-explanatory, and text  
used only as a last resort. But will users really understand all by  
themselves what they need to do? This is where the Curse of Knowledge  
is at its most confusing. You understand interfaces, you understand  
the latest Internet fashions, you are technologically inclined, and can  
intuitively survive nearly all digital products that you come across.  
But what about your users? What can be considered a basic skill for  
anyone living in the 21st century, and what still needs explaining? When  
do you need to write drag, type, click and select, and when is it obvious?  
And what is right for all other aspects of UX is absolutely correct here\:  
the best way to find out if you need or don’t need written help is by  
performing usability tests.  
When an explanation is not required  
Fields, buttons, drop-downs, exclamation or question mark icons, links,  
asterisks, radio buttons, and check boxes, all these don’t need instructions.  
You can simply write the label next to it, for example "Email", and not "enter  
your email address", because users already know what to do in these fields.  
In most cases also next to radio buttons and check boxes you only need the  
label and don’t need to add select, and you don’t need to add click on a button.  
# Examples  
OkCupid provides drop-downs,  
without telling the user what to do,  
simply because the drop-down is so  
well known, and thus the interface  
remains free of words and very  
simple.  
www.okcupid.com  
206 | Questions and knowledge gaps Instead of all this\: you could have only this\:  
And on this form they only needed to keep four words\:  
\(Though, as I said earlier, it's best to make the title more welcoming on  
a site’s gateway\).  
And the following instruction is not required above these buttons, as  
they already convey all the information needed\:  
Questions and knowledge gaps | 207 When an explanation is necessary  
If you have developed a unique interface to meet your needs, or the  
interface is still considered innovative, it is worthwhile telling users  
how to use it. Write short, simple and precise instructions in exactly the  
right place.  
# Examples  
A good example of a precise instruction, appearing exactly when it is  
needed, is from Instagram\:  
"Tap video for sound"  
Tapping the video to start or stop the sound is \(still\) not an intuitive  
action, though it will be soon because Instagram has adopted it. But at  
the time of writing these lines, it is actually the opposite of what our  
intuition tells us, because we are used to YouTube, where clicking the  
video stops it.  
When they first introduced the feature, Instagram wrote the instruction  
at the bottom of a video when it played\:  
Instagram app \(photo\: Elazar Yifrah\)  
208 | Questions and knowledge gaps But with the passage of time, when the instruction became better known to  
users, it started to appear only in those instances where Instagram had  
grounds to believe that the users weren’t acquainted with the interface.  
For example, if they tried to turn up the volume while the video was  
playing, when in fact the sound was turned off.  
Instagram app \(photo\: Elazar Yifrah\)  
Typeform designed a unique UI for creating questionnaires. The  
connection between blocks and questions is not commonly known or  
obvious, so they add visual and textual help to make things clearer and  
help users get started.  
www.typeform.com  
Questions and knowledge gaps | 209 TIP  
# 23  
# Save users from themselves  
If incorrect use of the interface can cause a problem for  
the users or to the process, for example to exit a process,  
to open a new window, to delete everything entered so far  
and so on, you should provide instructions clearly and  
prominently, even in those places that seem obvious to  
you. The more repercussions an action might have, the more  
reason to explain it.  
# TIP  
# 24  
# Be nice - even when writing instructions  
Instructions need to be simple and clear, but in a nice  
service-oriented way, not as an order to do something. If it  
fits your voice and tone, you can even inject some humor \(but  
never at the expense of clarity\).

# CHAPTER  
7 common concerns and suspicions that you need to  
address If you ignore it, it won’t go away  
Users have many good reasons not to trust us. Everyone is trying to sell  
them something, be it directly or indirectly, and what’s free now will  
require payment later. Each time users provide their email address,  
they are swamped by spam, and sometimes they hear about yet another  
giant company whose database has been hacked, and credit cards or other  
private details were exposed. When they download a small widget, three  
other things they didn’t request are also downloaded, and in general, to  
survive the Internet they need to be constantly on their guard and with  
their eyes open.  
There is no reason why users, not yet acquainted with your company,  
should place their trust in you. This trust needs to be earned. First and  
foremost, you need to earn it by genuinely and practically and really  
being on the side of the users in all your service interfaces. But you also  
need to show them that you are worthy of their trust. Instead of ignoring  
their legitimate concerns and suspicions, you need to explicitly tell  
your users that you are aware of their concerns and respect them, and that  
they are in good hands.  
In this chapter I’ll demonstrate a few weak points that could arouse the  
concern or suspicion of users, and how to overcome them.  
Concerns and suspicions | 213 Concern \#1\: Providing an email address  
In the chapter on signing up for a newsletter, we said that users have two  
main concerns when they provide their email address\:  
a. That you’ll drown them in emails. That’s why you need to reassure them  
about the low frequency of the newsletter. It's also worthwhile to remind  
them they can unsubscribe with a single click any time they want to.  
b. That you’ll pass their email address to others who’ll drown them in  
spam. That’s why you need to promise them that their email address stays  
with you and that the privacy of users is important to you.  
# Examples  
See also the short and simple phrases on the sign up forms in chapter 5.  
metroMSP, an IT support company in North  
Jersey, tells users that it hates spam even  
more than they do.  
www.metromsp.com  
On the checkout form of Sugru, the magical glue, there’s a checkbox  
offering users to subscribe to their newsletter. Right next to it, they  
specify the frequency and promise not to spam.  
www.sugru.com  
Push notifications may be seen as spam, and  
when asking for permission it is advised to  
address this concern. Rounds app asks for your  
permission and promises to treat it well.  
Rounds app  
214 | Concerns and suspicions Concern \#2\: Providing special personal  
# information  
Users are vigilant nowadays about privacy and are reluctant to provide  
any information that is not absolutely necessary, mainly date of birth,  
telephone number, gender, home address, and so on. If asked to provide  
such information, they become suspicious and ask what do you need it for?  
We need to supply a good answer\:  
a. If it’s a required field, explain why you need these details and  
guarantee their privacy.  
b. If it’s an optional field, explain why it is worthwhile that users give  
you these details, and how it will benefit them.  
# Examples  
During payment, when the cursor is placed in the telephone number field,  
Tesco displays a tooltip explaining why they ask for the number. They  
also calm users and promise that it is the only use they will make of this  
information. Simple and perfect.  
www.tesco.com  
Monday specifies that giving the phone number is optional, but tells  
users how it’ll help them in the future \(immediate support when needed\),  
and reassures them that it will never be used for spamming.  
www.monday.com  
Concerns and suspicions | 215 At Claire’s, the fashion accessory shop, they’re very aware of privacy  
concerns, and make sure to be as transparent as possible about why they  
collect personal details and what they’re going to do with it.  
When signing up they reassure\:  
When asking for a phone number they answer the common question - Why is  
this required? They could have phrased it in a much shorter, nicer way  
though, such as\: Only for necessary delivery purposes, nothing else.  
When asking for date of birth, Claire’s uses both tactics\: they explain  
why they must ask for this information, and tell users how they’ll benefit  
from giving it.  
www.claires.com  
American Eagle explains what they need the phone number for, and promises  
not to share it. They also prevent possible error by stating up front that  
the number should match the one affiliated with the credit card.  
www.ae.com  
216 | Concerns and suspicions It’s pretty obvious why a car rental company will ask for users’ age, but  
Europcar gives a full explanation in case the user is new to the matter.  
www.europcar.com  
Pinterest explains why they ask  
users about their gender. It also  
suggests a costumized gender field.  
www.pinterest.com  
Vimeo doesn’t ask for users’ gender but rather pronouns, and immediately  
explain why they’re asking.  
www.vimeo.com  
These are from the fashion shop boohoo. Both fields are optional, so they  
tell users what’s in it for them.  
www.boohoo.com  
Concerns and suspicions | 217 Concern \#3\: Signing up using a social media  
# account  
As mentioned in the chapter on sign up processes \(chapter 4\), registration  
using social media is widespread but still arouses concern. So it’s  
important to promise users that\:  
a. You won’t post anything in their name.  
b. You won’t share their information with other parties.  
# Examples  
See a few more examples in chapter 4. Note that in most cases there  
is only a reference to the first concern, and that might prove to be a  
mistake, because the second is also very important.  
Munchery, the fresh meal delivery service, promises there will be no  
surprises.  
www.munchery.com  
On discreet websites this promise becomes doubly important. This is from  
eHarmony, the dating platform.  
www.eharmony.com  
Switch is a job seeking app using LinkedIn accounts for uploading resumes.  
Switch app  
218 | Concerns and suspicions Concern \#4\: Secured payment  
Buying online appears to be one of the most worrying processes. The  
main concern of course is that credit card information is kept secure.  
It is worth your while to address this concern and relieve it right up  
front where users click to go from their cart to checkout, and of course,  
on the payment form itself.  
# Examples  
Airbnb places the reassuring tooltip about security exactly where it’s  
needed\: right in the credit card number field.  
www.airbnb.com  
Europcar assumes that customers may prefer to pay when picking up the car  
for security reasons, so they explicitly say\:  
www.europcar.com  
On the top of the payment form, Macy’s says\:  
www.macys.com  
Concerns and suspicions | 219 H&M writes in their checkout form\:  
www.hm.com  
This is Marks and Spencer's button in the cart. Exactly at the point when  
users are debating whether to proceed and purchase the item, and if they  
should click the button or not, they receive a response to their main  
concern\: Yes, the checkout is secured!  
www.marksandspencer.com  
And this is the fashion shop Roxy’s button in the shopping cart\:  
www.roxy.com  
# TIP  
# 25  
# Who pays for the shipment?  
Another common concern when buying online is related to  
shipment. Who pays for it? How much does it cost? If the  
product doesn’t meet expectations, how is it returned  
and who pays for the return shipment? Answer all these  
questions clearly right at the beginning of the process,  
and save your users doubts and hesitations.  
220 | Concerns and suspicions Concern \#5\: Free trial  
The main concern for users when signing up for a free trial period is that  
they’ll be charged as soon as that period is over. The solution, as usual,  
is simply to clearly refute this concern.  
At the beginning of the sign up process, promise users that there is no  
need for their credit card details \(meaning they can’t be charged\).  
If you do need credit card details, promise that on no account will you  
charge it without the explicit permission of the user.  
# Examples  
Poptin is a platform for creating popups. Spotify is... well, you know  
Spotify.  
www.poptin.com  
www.spotify.com  
Google Cloud Platform does ask for credit card details but promises\:  
cloud.google.com  
Concerns and suspicions | 221 Concern \#6\: Settings and configuration  
When users start a process, they usually expect to finish it quickly.  
If the process requires some serious thinking from users, they might  
decide to leave it to a later date, when they have more time. To avoid  
that, explain clearly to them that these settings can be changed later,  
whenever they want to. In this way, the users won’t feel like they are  
making a lifelong commitment, and will be able to quickly define  
settings without worrying about future consequences.  
# Examples  
When creating a new online course, the dilemma about which title to use  
can continue until the last minute, and Udemy are aware of that. But they  
don’t want users to delay the process, so they let them enter a temporary  
title, and clearly state it to concerned users.  
www.udemy.com  
tumblr really doesn’t want users to delay sign up just because it’s hard  
for them to select a username. Their solution is to offer loads of funny  
names, and promise that they can easily change it whenever they want.  
www.tumblr.com  
222 | Concerns and suspicions Typeform, the questioner creator, offers personalized templates, but  
they know the need will probably change over time, so they say\:  
www.typeform.com  
# TIP  
# 26  
# It’s worth the effort!  
If your process includes steps that demand some extra effort on  
the part of your users, and regardless of whether it is optional  
or mandatory \(such as uploading a photo, installing an add-  
on, or writing a few words about themselves\), their inclination  
will be to skip that step so that they can move on.  
So, write them a few words about why it’s good for them to do it,  
and how they’ll benefit. Remind them why they came to your site in  
the first place, and how this will get them closer to their goal.  
For example, when Facebook motivates users to upload a photo  
to the profile they just created, it talks about friends easily  
connecting with you, and that’s exactly why people come here.  
www.facebook.com  
Concerns and suspicions | 223 Concern \#7\: Download or installation  
The big concern for users about downloading and installing is that in  
addition to the desired product they’ll get a few other very undesirable  
products\: viruses, spywares, toolbars and the rest of the parasites. So,  
if your process includes downloading a product, assure the users it is  
free of viruses and that the installation will not include anything else.  
# Examples  
This is how they say it on Download.com\:  
www.download.com  
Before downloading the add-on for Chrome, Rounds says simply\:

PREVENTING ERRORS  
AND OTHER SETBACKS  
# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
5 setbacks that can be easily avoided with the help  
of microcopy A stitch in time saves nine  
In Chapter 7 we discussed how to phrase error messages so that users  
can quickly continue with the process and make an irritating experience  
slightly better. But it is even better to prevent the errors in the  
first place. In this chapter I’ll point out some weak points where users  
might receive errors or otherwise be disappointed. As you, the process  
designers, see the full picture, and know which values the system can  
accept and which values will produce errors, and as only you know what’s  
going to happen on the next page or stage of the process, you are the one  
responsible for letting users know what they need, and prevent them from  
falling into these traps.  
All you have to do is go over your forms and processes, identify the weak  
points \(that we’ll look at right now\), and add a few words next to the  
suspect places.  
Errors and other setbacks | 227 Stitch \#1\: Required fields  
Users should never have to see the most unnecessary of error messages -  
“This field is required”. The fact that a field is required should be clear,  
explicit and unequivocal, though unintimidating.  
You can achieve this by using asterisks. Yes, even if all the fields are  
required, as seen in the screenshot below.  
If you find out that your users are put off by asterisks, as some studies show,  
you can clearly state at the top of the form that all the fields are required,  
and note “optional” only next to those which are not \(and then ask yourself  
if you really need all those you left as optional. The less information you  
request, the greater the chance that users will complete the form\).  
Whatever you do, make sure to remove all ambiguities, and save users the  
need to draw conclusions for themselves about your rules. Just be very  
clear about it.  
# Examples  
Look how simple and clear it is on  
the sign up form for the Musketeer  
app, that enables citizens to help  
each other in case of an emergency.  
You don’t even need a sentence  
explaining that the asterisk  
indicates a mandatory field, it’s  
perfectly obvious.  
Musketeer app  
228 | Errors and other setbacks Walmart makes things super clear with a combination of asterisks and  
“optional”.  
www.walmart.com  
This is from Marks and Spencer. It shows another way to deal with  
required fields\: when hovering over the button \(even before clicking\),  
the instruction appears in a tooltip and says what required details are  
missing, thus preventing the error message.  
www.marksandspencer.com  
Errors and other setbacks | 229 Stitch \#2\: Symbols or special formatting  
When users are requested to type in a value that includes special symbols  
\(such as dash, slash, a combination of letters and numbers, and so on\),  
or there are several possible formats for this value \(such as the date  
or phone number\), they ask themselves if they should actually type the  
symbols, or which format is acceptable. There are of course users, and  
maybe even most of them, who are not even aware of the problem and don’t  
ask themselves any questions. They just type whatever seems right to them.  
The ideal should be that the system is indifferent to formats and can  
accept whatever the users type. If you succeeded in creating such a system,  
you don’t need to write anything.  
But if the system only accepts a value written in a certain specific way,  
you must point that out to the users before they start typing, to avoid  
the error.  
# Examples  
The next example uses an interface solution to make life easier for the  
user.  
The Idle Man broke down the date into its component fields, so the user  
doesn’t need to think about a period or slash. Then they wrote the exact  
format under each field\: day and month in two digits, year in four.  
www.theidleman.com  
230 | Errors and other setbacks When linking a bank account to a PayPal account, formatting instructions  
automatically appear beneath the field when it comes into focus, to make  
sure users type in the correct details.  
www.paypal.com  
When linking a credit card, the formatting instruction appears as a  
placeholder.  
This is the field beforehand\:  
And this is the field after the user clicks inside it\:  
And this is the field after the user clicks inside it\:  
www.paypal.com  
Errors and other setbacks | 231 Stitch \#3\: Size, range or length restrictions  
If there are fields that only accept limited values, for example a certain  
range of numbers or time, a limited number of characters, format or size  
limitation of a file that can be uploaded, and so on, check if there is a UX  
way to prevent entering unacceptable values\: shading dates on a calendar,  
turning off the option of typing when the maximum number of allowed  
characters is reached, etc.  
Anyway, explicitly write the limitations so that users won’t encounter  
avoidable errors and understand why these options are unavailable. If  
this is a field, don’t write the limitations as a placeholder within it.  
The placeholder will disappear once the users start typing, preventing  
them from rechecking it if needed \(see Chapter 10\).  
# Examples  
OkCupid provides the minimum size of a file, and some other important  
instructions…  
www.okcupid.com  
Foodgawker, a photographed  
recipe site, did put the  
limitations as placeholders,  
but outside each field  
there’s also a countdown  
number indicating how many  
characters users have left,  
helping them to always know  
where they stand.  
www.foodgawker.com  
232 | Errors and other setbacks Stitch \#4\: Passwords  
Here too, it’s best if you don’t limit users \(unless you have specific  
security requirements\), so that they can use one of their regular  
passwords or one that's easy for them to remember. If this is the case,  
you obviously don’t need to provide instructions. If you only have a  
very wide restriction, such as\: the password should be between 4-60  
characters - most passwords will answer this criterion anyway, so you  
don’t need to write anything.  
But if you do have restrictions on how the password must be constructed,  
write them next to the field \(or above it, next to the label, for screen  
reader users\), or in an exclamation mark icon next to the label, or in a  
tooltip displayed when the user puts the field into focus.  
It’s best to provide users with an indication that their password is  
acceptable immediately after they finish typing it in \(in-line\), or even  
better - display a tick for each restriction they met. In any case, it’s  
recommended not to write the restrictions in the field so they don’t  
disappear as soon as the user starts typing, and challenge their short  
term memory.  
When writing passwords microcopy, address the following points, based on  
what is relevant to your situation\:  
• How many characters \(minimum, range or exact number\)  
• The type of characters the password must include \(such as at least one  
capital letter\)  
• Characters that the password cannot contain \(such as symbols like\:  
? - “\). You can also write it in a positive way\: “letters and numbers  
only”.  
• Case sensitivity  
Errors and other setbacks | 233 Examples  
American Eagle has only two, very clear restrictions. As you can see,  
there’s no need to write a full sentence, such as\: The password must  
include... but rather be short and to the point, in a way that users can  
scan and understand the restrictions in a split second.  
www.ae.com  
Uniqlo also writes their limitations clearly under the field \(it would be  
easier to scan if it appeared as a bullet list, wouldn’t it?\).  
www.uniqlo.com  
The Israeli TV provider Yes shows the rules as a tooltip when the  
user places the cursor in the password field, which is kept on display  
throughout. As soon as one of the rules has been met, a tick appears.  
Excellent!  
www.yes.co.il \(Translated from Hebrew\)  
234 | Errors and other setbacks Stitch \#5\: Real-life problems  
The user experience doesn’t end when users leave the digital product,  
but continues wherever the customer is in contact with the brand. If  
the online process is connected to concrete processes that take place  
afterwards in real life, such as issuing a certificate, printing a  
document or receiving a shipment - think about each stage in the process  
and check if any problems could occur that you should point out right  
now and prevent.  
Even if the potential problem is supposedly outside your jurisdiction,  
pointing it out to users will spare them the disappointment with the  
provided service, and give them the feeling that you thought about  
everything on their behalf. They might even thank you \(or at least feel  
grateful\).  
# Examples  
The deliveries of Belle and Sue fashion store only go out during regular  
working hours. But there’s no going around the fact that during working  
hours most of their customers are at work... Belle and Sue took that into  
account and propose a creative solution that is offered as soon as the  
customer starts making the order.  
www.belleandsue.co.il \(Translated from Hebrew\)  
Errors and other setbacks | 235 The QR Code Generator lets users decide if they want a margin to their QR  
code or not. But the site creators thought one step ahead\: if users decide  
to remove the margin, they receive an extra piece of information - that  
to scan a marginless code requires printing it on a light background.  
This printing suggestion is a result of the company thinking about the  
process of how QR codes are used after their customers leave the site.  
www.the-qrcode-generator.com \(Powered by Visualead\)  
Marmalade Market, the Israeli equivalent of Etsy, offers a wide range of  
products, many of them are one of a kind or handmade, that have a myriad of  
potential confusing features. Marmalade wants to prevent frustration and  
misunderstandings that might arise between the customer and salesperson,  
and so it suggests that the customer leaves a detailed message for the  
shop owner. The placeholder provides examples of the type of details that  
are worth pointing out.  
market.marmelada.co.il \(Design\: Say Digital | Translated from Hebrew\)  
236 | Errors and other setbacks Pekin Zahala restaurant in Tel Aviv knows that lots of people hate  
cilantro and that many are allergic to peanuts; so these are two  
ingredients that can cause problems once the customer receives the  
delivered meal. We can assume that in the past customers provided the  
restaurant with angry feedback on discovering that their delivery  
contained one of these ingredients \(even though this is clearly  
mentioned in the menu\). So nowadays, when you order a delivery online,  
and it contains cilantro or peanuts, a special alert appears in red.  
www.pekin.co.il \(Translated from Hebrew\)  
This is an excellent example of holistic thinking about the process,  
that prevents disappointment and the feeling of receiving bad service.  
Not to mention the excellent phrasing that makes the issue funny and  
provides a good experience for all the customers.

MICROCOPY AND  
# ACCESSIBILITY  
\*This chapter was written with Rotem Binheim, UX designer and AUX expert.  
# THIS  
# CHAPTER  
# INCLUDES  
7 guidelines for writing accessible microcopy Microcopy for all  
There’s a fine line between providing a good, effective experience and  
causing frustration - and the difference can be just one word, or a  
quick hint, exactly where it’s needed. This is doubly true in the case of  
accessible microcopy and people who have difficulty or are unable to see  
the screen.  
The good news is there are 7 simple guidelines we need to follow to  
make sure we’re serving these folks. Of course, these guidelines are  
for microcopy writers, but since most of us aren’t in charge of actually  
implementing what we write, it’s important that product managers, UX  
designers, visual designers and developers are also familiar with these  
principles.  
# How does your microcopy sound on a  
# screen reader?  
People who are visually impaired often use a screen reader to browse  
websites and use apps. Navigating with a screen reader isn’t done with  
a mouse \(as the user is unable to see the on-screen cursor\), but rather  
by using the keyboard. Each press of the Tab or arrow keys advances the  
screen reader one element further - from the top down and from left to  
right, or according to a hierarchy set during development. The screen  
reader audibly reads each element in focus and identifies it as a link,  
button, or image when necessary.  
As a result, people using screen readers don’t perceive a full picture of  
the screen, or even a partial one in case of adjacent screen elements -  
instead, they’re notified of each element separately.  
How can we make our microcopy compatible with screen readers? Let’s  
dive in.  
Microcopy and accessibility | 239 1\. Think top-down and left to right  
As mentioned, using a keyboard to navigate a website advances us from  
top to bottom and from left to right \(and also back. In languages that are  
written right-to-left, the progress will be in that direction of course\).  
So when we embed a piece of microcopy to help users complete a task or  
prevent them from getting an error, placing the microcopy in front of the  
action is critical.  
For example, on the form below, people will hear the field label  
\(“Password”\), and on the next Tab they’ll enter their password. But when  
they create a password, they have no idea that there’s a guideline written  
below the field \(Must be 6 or more characters and contain at least 1  
number\) because the screen reader has not yet reached it. So users will  
choose a password and then find out there were further instructions, and  
then have to go back and choose a password that meets the requirements.  
In the next example, screen-reader users will reach the drop-downs  
without knowing there‘s more information to the right. They, like everyone  
else, will be wondering why you’re asking for their date of birth, but they  
wouldn’t know there’s an answer in a tooltip after the input fields. They  
might skip this question, or even abandon the task, because they don’t see  
why they should give up this piece of personal information.  
The solution here is to place the instruction right after the label, ahead  
of the input fields. The accessible order of elements is therefore\:  
Label \> Assistive text \> Control  
240 | Microcopy and accessibility Here’s how Facebook does it\:  
www.facebook.com  
And here’s how Walmart does it\:  
www.walmart.com  
Note for developers\: The elements can appear on screen in any order,  
as long as you set the keyboard focus shift in the correct accessible  
order. However, for seeing keyboard-only users, or people with cognitive  
impairments, having the focus indicator jump around the screen in an  
unexpected way could be a jarring experience. Ideally, content items will  
be aligned visually to match the document order, and vice versa \(thanks  
to Scott Vinkle for the important note\).  
For the same reason, it’s important not to place any microcopy under  
a confirmation button. A colleague with a vision impairment told us  
about her failure to complete an online purchase as she clicked the  
confirmation button \(5 times\) and nothing happened. She then found out  
that there was an “accept conditions” check box under the confirmation  
button, along with an error message pointing to the fact it was a required  
field. Of course, she couldn’t see those, nor did the focus shift to them  
automatically, so after all the time and effort invested in placing the  
order, she wound up having to go to a brick-and-mortar store.  
Microcopy and accessibility | 241 In the next form, how would screen-reader users know there’s a captcha  
underneath when they hit the Reset Password button? And even worse,  
when they miss it, are the location and phrasing of the error message  
helpful? Will users that can only hear the error message, and still  
don’t know there’s a captcha down there, understand what the problem was  
and how to fix it?  
# To sum things up  
All of the information needed to complete an action should be present  
ahead of it — above or just to the right of the control label. In cases that  
may result in errors, make sure during the development stage that the  
focus shifts correctly, so no one misses the piece of copy that can help  
them stay on the right track.  
242 | Microcopy and accessibility 2\. Be witty, but not at the expense of delivering  
# a plain message  
Will people understand where they are and what comes next, just from  
hearing the text read to them? In the next image you see the loading time  
meter for a swimming school website.  
It includes some clever microcopy \(Diving in soon\), but for users who will  
only hear the words and not see the entire screen, it’s not at all clear  
that they need to wait for the site to load.  
A simple correction can solve this. Explicitly say something like\: The  
site is loading; we’ll be diving in soon  
When users reach an empty state or 404 page, refrain from using just an  
image or clever words to explain where they are. And try not to use a  
combination of image and text that will be misunderstood if someone  
hears one but not the other.  
What will users who can’t see the screen understand from only hearing  
“Notifications, it’s oh so quiet”?  
Microcopy and accessibility | 243 For errors or empty states, write\: The page was not found, or There  
are no results, or There are no items in the cart or There are no new  
notifi cations - and also explain how to proceed from there. All users  
will find this helpful \(see Chapter 9\).  
On sign up or login pages, although it’s always worthwhile to welcome  
users with an inviting headline \(see Chapter 4\), don’t forget to say what  
the page is all about. In the next example of a sign-up page for a wedding  
planning website, the headline Let’s take our relationship to the next  
level is appropriate for the desired voice and tone, but it doesn’t say  
that this is the place to sign up for the site.  
When screen-reader users arrive at the email field, they still don’t know  
there’s a password field and registration button below it, so they have no  
idea why their email is required. Maybe the next level is signing up for  
a newsletter? Granted, they’ll discover the password field on their next  
click as the keyboard navigation proceeds, but you can save them from the  
hassle of wondering “What do I do here and why do they need my email?”  
Oh, and it’s best to mention that this is a sign-up page for seeing  
users as well, and add a few good reasons they should register. Two birds,  
one stone.  
Writing the basic message is especially important on success and error  
messages. Close your eyes and repeat out loud the message you wrote. What  
do you understand from it? Is it unequivocal?  
244 | Microcopy and accessibility In a success message, do users who just hear the microcopy and can’t see  
the green V, or smiling emoji, experience the reassuring confirmation and  
understand they’ve successfully completed the action as intended?  
In an error message, do users who just hear the microcopy understand  
exactly what went wrong and how to proceed from here, even if they can’t  
see that the field now has a red outline, or an added red exclamation mark?  
# 3\. A written alternative to every icon and  
# every image  
Every image or icon that bears visual information should have a short  
description - Alt - set during development. This text will not appear  
on screen, but will be read to users navigating using a keyboard and  
screen reader. If an image fails to load, due to connectivity problems  
for example, the Alt will be visible to seeing users as well — so it helps  
everybody.  
Not every illustration needs a description. If it’s a stock photo  
that doesn’t enhance understanding or isn't important for setting  
the experience, it’s actually better to spare this information from  
users navigating with the keyboard because they’re inundated with  
information as it is.  
In this example, there’s no need to describe the scene appearing on the  
TV screen nor the TV itself, as there is a description of it to its right.  
www.amazon.com  
Microcopy and accessibility | 245 Icons are images too. If you have icons representing actions or features  
and they’re unaccompanied by words \(like a cogwheel or a house\), add an  
Alt to them that says where they lead to, like\: Homepage or Settings. If we  
don’t add an Alt, the screen reader will just say image or link or button  
\(depending on the setting developers decided on\), and users who can’t see  
them won’t know about the extra actions or features present.  
The icon for more information, indicated by an image of an ‘i’, ‘!’ or ‘?’,  
should also have an Alt describing what lies ahead. For example\: How  
to choose a password or More info. If we fail to give these tiny-but-  
important icons an Alt, users who can’t see them won’t be aware of this  
crucial information.  
Heads up \#1 There’s no point in being clever with Alt text. It should be  
clear and unequivocal.  
Heads up \#2 If the information is extremely salient, consider displaying  
it at all times rather than as a tooltip.  
Emojis have preset Alts. Want to know what users hear when you use  
emojis in your microcopy? Watch “What do Emojis look like?!” by Molly  
Burke on YouTube.  
# 4\. Be more descriptive than “Read more” for links  
# and buttons  
Navigating with a keyboard allows you to jump between screen sections\:  
• Navigate between headlines only  
• Navigate between links and buttons only  
People who aren’t able to see the screen in its entirety can thus quickly  
grasp what the important elements on the page are, then choose to navigate  
directly to what most interests them. So what does someone hear when  
jumping between buttons in the following screen?  
246 | Microcopy and accessibility Since the headlines aren’t links, this person will just hear “View post”  
repeated 3 times, with no indication whatsoever as to what these posts  
are about. It only takes a minor adjustment to solve this - no need to be  
overly clever. For example, you could replace each “View post” with\: My  
graduation outfi t, How to stop chasing success, To the gift guide.  
When links or buttons give a little bit more information about the page  
they lead to, everybody wins\: people with screen readers can decide if  
it’s relevant, and everyone gets a good specific prompt to keep on reading.  
# 5\. All microcopy should appear as live text, not  
# as an image  
Screen readers only read live text. So if your button is actually an image;  
if the word beneath the icon is saved with it as one image; if you put a  
large image on your 404 page, with text in it explaining the situation -  
none of this text will be read to users who can’t see.  
In order for an icon set like this one \(by Spotify\) to be accessible, the  
microcopy should appear as live text, or be paired with an appropriate  
Alt text.  
Spotify app  
Microcopy and accessibility | 247 6\. Readability\: Permanent text in high contrast  
Keep it permanent  
All the instructions, hints and notes regarding filling a form or taking  
any other action, should always be available - permanently visible or in  
a tooltip you can return to and read at any point in time.  
Placeholders that disappear as soon as the field comes into focus are  
inaccessible, even to seeing users. Therefore, this form isn’t accessible\:  
If set by developers as available for screen readers, placeholders  
that change location \(like the ones in the next form\) are passable for  
visually impaired users as far as accessibility, but their movement might  
confuse users with cognitive impairment. So if you have abundant space,  
place the labels outside the field - always visible and static. If space is  
at a premium, make sure whatever appeared in the field is also available  
when it’s in focus.  
www.wix.com  
248 | Microcopy and accessibility Design in high contrast  
All microcopy should appear in high contrast \(to the background it  
appears on\) so users with vision impairment or dyslexia can easily see  
and read it. This will also be much more convenient for others, making  
it easier for all users to read basic info.  
If your placeholders contain information important for completing a  
task, they too should adhere to the high-contrast standards and not  
appear too bright. If they don’t contain pertinent information, why are  
they there? Remove them, it’ll benefit all users \(see Chapter 10\). In the  
next form, the placeholders are in low contrast and inaccessible, but are  
redundant too, so they shouldn’t be enhanced but rather deleted.  
This is the sign up form for the Tesco website. The labels are permanent  
and out of the field, and there is high contrast in the field. Way to go.  
www.tesco.com  
Microcopy and accessibility | 249 7\. Simple is best  
We tend to imagine writing for people who instantly comprehend what  
they read, but not everyone is actually able to do that. Many users won’t  
necessarily understand - or have the patience to try to understand -  
abbreviations, acronyms, or the use of puns and word play.  
This login form is very cool, but it’s inaccessible. Even if everyone  
understands that “magic word” refers to password, will they all  
understand that “I don’t have a magic word yet” means “I don’t have an  
account”? This is cleverness upon cleverness that doesn’t serve any of  
the users. Also note the low contrast in the light-blue fields and how  
difficult it is to read them.  
250 | Microcopy and accessibility A personal note  
Ever since I’ve learned the principles of accessibility detailed here,  
I’ve overcome a big challenge in writing microcopy at large. I got a clear  
answer to my question of how clever I should be when writing microcopy. I  
imagine the screen reader reading the text, or a user with a cognitive  
impairment reading it, and I immediately arrive at where and how much  
cleverness I can use and where to draw the line. My writing has become  
simpler and clearer, with witty wording only in the right places.  
So keep on writing rich, interesting, character-filled microcopy - but  
always remember to ask yourself if everyone will understand what you’ve  
written.  
Microcopy and accessibility | 251 Increase your form completion rates  
Just before you release a new form out into the world, or if you already  
have a form that too many users abandon without completing or call  
support to deal with, go over this checklist. For further guidance on  
each item, explore the relevant chapters in this book.  
Before you dive in  
1\. Do users have enough good reasons to fill the form?  
Do users understand why they need to fill it, and what’s in it for them?  
Add on the top of the form, or on the page leading to it, a call to action  
that guaranties true value.  
2\. Is there too much microcopy in the form?  
Does it look overloaded? It could happen if\:  
• You over-explained, even the parts that need no explanation.  
• You’ve explained just what’s needed, but used too many words.  
• The UI/UX is not intuitive enough. Go back to the UX designers and  
reopen the issue.  
3\. Is there not enough microcopy in the form?  
Did you skip on giving important explanations or reassuring words, in  
order not to overburden the users? Are critical instructions hiding in  
tooltips? Take them out.  
Clarity  
4\. Conversational writing  
Make sure you address the users directly, in everyday words and in a  
short, straightforward language.  
5\. Control labels  
Check each label individually and make sure they can be easily  
understood by all users.  
252 | Microcopy and usability checklist with this microcopy checklist  
Make sure they don’t include\:  
• Professional language that can be stated using simpler words.  
• Terms you made up for internal use and were just left there.  
• Abstract or vague terms that might be ambiguous.  
If you find one of the above, either a. Substitute it with simpler terms,  
or b. Add an explanation.  
6\. When users have several options to choose from  
In drop-downs, radio buttons or check boxes — make sure all the  
options are\:  
• Easily and quickly understood.  
• Their meaning and implication are evident from their name \(if not,  
consider adding a tooltip\).  
• Distinguishable from one another \(none can be confused with  
another\).  
Where multiple choices can be made, say so.  
7\. Placeholders  
• They shouldn’t contain any information the user might need while  
typing.  
• Make sure they add relevant information and don’t just repeat the  
label.  
• They should be in high contrast, to best serve accessibility  
guidelines.  
8\. Tooltips  
• Make sure they don’t contain critical information better left  
permanently visible.  
• If this is a one-time or seldom filled form, consider using tooltips  
that automatically appear when the field comes into focus.

# out &  
# keep  
Proceeding smoothly with no interruptions  
9\. Preventing banal, irritating error messages  
Check with the product manager or developers about each and every  
field\: What values and format does the system accept, and which values and  
formats will it reject with an error message?  
For those that will return errors, give the users an advanced warning  
around the field.  
10\. Marking required/optional fields  
Use the asterisk or write “Optional”. If they are all required - mention  
this loud and clear or mark them all.  
11\. Open questions  
• Did you provide users with a lead to start their answer? Something to  
help them focus and make your meaning clear? Maybe a good tip on how to  
effectively frame an answer?  
• If there’s a limit to the number of characters in the answer - tell the  
users about it. Even add a counter.  
12\. Switches and check boxes  
Whenever there’s an option to turn something on or off \(enable/disable\) -  
using a switch or a check box - make sure the users have all the necessary  
information to decide whether to switch it on or off, including the  
implications of each choice.  
13\. Attaching files to the form  
If there are any restrictions on file type or size, make it clearly known in  
advance.  
14\. Error messages  
• Have you received all the potential error scenarios in this form from  
the development team?  
• Have you written good microcopy for them, helping the users, following  
the best practices for writing error messages?  
254 | Microcopy and usability checklistAddress questions and concerns  
15\. Asking for personal information \(email address, social security  
number, phone number, date of birth, etc.\)  
• If you need a piece of personal information - explain why.  
• If the piece of personal information is optional - tell the users how  
giving it will serve their needs.  
16\. Asking for complex information  
Do users know where to get this information from? If they don’t - explain  
where it can be found.  
17\. Security  
• With online payment - clearly indicate it’s secured.  
• If your business requires a higher level of discretion - clearly note  
that the information given will be secured and kept confidential.  
18\. Making changes later  
• If users can later on change whatever they input into the form -  
tell them that. It will be easier for them to go ahead and fill it  
with no worries.  
• If they cannot change it later - give them a heads up to avoid  
disappointment later.  
It doesn’t end with clicking Send  
19\. Waiting time  
If there’s a loading and processing time between clicking the Send  
button and the success message - prepare a nice message suitable for  
the experience, and show your users you gave some thought even to this  
small detail.  
20\. Success message  
What do users see as soon as they complete the task and submit the form?  
Is the success message pleasantly rewarding and completes the  
experience you wish to create?

MICROCOPY FOR  
COMPLEX SYSTEMS  
\*This chapter was written thanks to the generous sharing of knowledge by professional UX and  
content women and men, who shared with me their insights, experience and screenshots\: Jasmin  
Galker Vaisburd of UniqUI; Shani Polanski, Leah Kraus, and Naama Shapira of PTC; Elinor

# IN THIS  
# CHAPTER  
A definition of complex systems  
The value of microcopy in complex systems  
Why complex systems need voice and tone design What are complex systems?  
In the context of this guide, complex systems are systems that users must  
use for functional or professional needs, and that have many components  
related to each other. These systems are not linear - that is to say that  
users don’t enter a system in one place and leave at the other end when  
they have completed the task - rather they access them again and again, for  
various tasks, and they use many components with multiple and consistent  
relationships to each other.  
# Types of complex systems  
1\. Expert systems  
These are aimed at professionals, such as a log for genetic researchers,  
a graphic design program, a modelling program for engineers, a  
communication system for telemarketers, or a system for garage mechanics  
to identify car problems.  
Screenshot of the program Creo Parametric from PTC, an expert system that is super  
professional and that engineers use to draw three-dimensional models  
Microcopy for complex systems | 257 2\. Intra-organizational systems  
These are meant to organize and manage knowledge or processes, such as  
a payroll system, management of medical records, customer management,  
sales tracking, or project management.  
A screenshot of Sales Cloud - A CRM by Salesforce  
3\. Functional systems for the general public  
These are designed to perform useful tasks, for example, word  
processors or a bank account management application.  
Microsoft Word is also a complex system, even though it is aimed at  
the general public  
258 | Microcopy for complex systems How most complex systems are used and the  
# effect on microcopy  
Before we dive into complex system microcopy, I must emphasize that  
in spite of the general reference to complex systems, there are those  
dedicated to NASA engineers, others to manage call centers by 24-year  
old shift leaders, still others for designers or developers working in an  
agile environment, systems for medical secretaries, and more and more.  
Here I’ll provide guidelines to writing microcopy that is common to most  
of them, but each system has its own voice and tone, according to the  
target audience, work environment and system goals. I’ll write more about  
it in the last part of this chapter.  
# Professional but practical  
For expert systems, the users are dependent on the system to implement  
and use their professional skills, and also to demonstrate their  
professionalism when around their peers.  
Therefore the microcopy needs to be professional. In contrast to the iron  
rule of microcopy for the general public, where you need to find a way to  
simplify professional or technical terms, here the use of professional  
terms is necessary for two reasons\:  
a. Usability - so that the users will find easily whatever they are looking  
for using the terms they are used to in their work environment.  
b. Proof of professionalism - so that users understand that the system  
has been developed specifically for them by people who are experts in  
their field, that it understands the profession and can execute any  
professional task in the best possible way. The system needs to sound  
professional to the extent that it enables its users to completely rely  
on it and entrust their professionalism to it.  
BUT professional does not mean high and pompous, but rather simple and  
precise.  
Microcopy for complex systems | 259 Why? First of all, in most cases, we are talking about tasks performed as  
part of a work day, in other words - with some level of pressure. So the  
microcopy needs to be practical - short, direct, clear, understandable in  
a split second, and enabling the quick and smooth performance of tasks.  
Your technologically complex system is in daily use in the 21st century,  
and if it sounds like an ancient dictionary, it will be harder for your  
contemporary users to understand. Complex systems require complicated  
explanations, so you need to avoid using academic, outdated, or irrelevant  
language that complicates things even more \(read all about it in Chapter  
2 of this guide\).  
This “high” language isn’t evidence of professionalism but of fixated  
thinking. It is really worthwhile to be super clear and write simply,  
precisely, in a practical and accessible language. The rule is\: write as a  
professional in the field would talk, and not as if they are writing their  
doctoral dissertation.  
The second reason you should write as simple as you can is to adapt the  
system to the varying levels of professional understanding\: beginners  
and experts, bright and average. Therefore a simple professional language  
is always preferable to a complex professional language.  
# Examples  
Alert from a NICE call center management system\: Shorter, more active,  
more direct, and the buttons say exactly what they do.  
260 | Microcopy for complex systems Notification from the Ministry of Justice system \(translated from  
Hebrew\). Read only the new version before reading the old one. Is there  
anything unprofessional, offensive or unacceptable? Hint\: No. It’s  
excellent. It is possible to be professional and use everyday words. And  
it is also good for accessibility!  
The title of a feature on the RealMatch system for tracking performance  
of job ads was\:  
Ad Distribution Trends and Examples  
But now it is much clearer and obvious, written in simple terms\:  
Where does your ad appear?  
Microcopy for complex systems | 261 Give your users a hand  
Complex systems are, as the name suggests, complex, and they usually  
require studying and gradual immersion. The principle that the interface  
should explain itself is not always possible here, because of the  
proliferation of features, possibilities and elements that are related  
to each other.  
Thus you could say that “our users are intelligent, they’ll understand”,  
“we’ll solve it with training”, “let them call the support desk”, “they  
should look at the user guide”. But it is possible to tackle it in another  
way, probably more effectively, using microcopy to help your users.  
1\. Titles  
Pay special attention to the menus, field labels, feature names, graph  
titles, categories, options in drop-downs, and column headings in tables,  
and make sure that they are clear and simple, that they explain exactly  
what appears or needs to be typed, are easy to understand quickly and  
unequivocal.  
2\. Placeholders and hints  
Do you want to provide a short explanation about a field? Write the  
explanation as a placeholder inside the field \(if the user doesn't need to  
remember it while typing\), or as a short sentence above it, or in a tooltip  
\(see Chapters 10 and 14 for best practices\). These small but powerful  
tools will help you educate your users without making them turn to the  
user guide.  
3\. Tooltips  
If you want to explain something complicated about the field or about  
another element in the interface, put a small i icon next to the label,  
that when hovered over displays a tooltip with the explanation \(as short  
and simple as possible, but still including all the required information  
that will save a call to the help desk or a search in the user guide\).  
Complex systems have many more tooltips, and they are longer, compared  
to simple systems aimed at the general public, and that’s just fine.  
See Chapter 14 for more about how and when to help users.  
262 | Microcopy for complex systems Examples  
This is an effective and complete tooltip for a column heading in a table  
on the RealMatch expert system. It explains what the users need to know  
about the statuses they currently see in the “status” column, but also  
explains about other optional statuses, thus it educates the users about  
how to use the system.  
Tooltips can also convey the value of the feature, thus helping the users  
to get the most out of it.  
# TIP  
# 27  
# You again?!  
Users will access your system daily, often a few times a day, and  
there are professions where all the work activity is centered  
on one system. At some stage the users stop reading the text and  
perform the actions automatically.  
So don’t be too clever with the microcopy of frequently  
performed tasks. Even if there is a place in your system for  
clever text, it is better not to use it on those tasks that users  
perform routinely. The first time they’ll laugh, but what about  
the second time? And the third? And the 30th?  
Microcopy for complex systems | 263 4\. Explicit referral to the user guide  
If the explanation is long and complex, and in those places where it is  
clear that users must read the guide to fully understand, don’t leave them  
to get upset about their knowledge gaps and search for the solutions by  
themselves. Show them that you are aware of the complexity and refer them  
to the exact place in the guide, as part of the system, and if possible as  
a direct link.  
# Example  
RealMatch expert system  
5\. Error messages  
Error messages are annoying, and if users are in the middle of a complex  
process and running out of time, then errors are also seen as frustrating  
and demoralizing. Needless to say, all error messages must be simple and  
effective \(see Chapter 7\), but in complex systems even more so. So explain  
the problem concisely, and guide the users on how to solve it so that they  
can continue. Use understandable words that are not threatening, express  
the problem calmly so that you don’t scare the users, and add instructions  
that can be implemented easily.  
Very important\: Present the problem from the point of view of the users,  
not of the system and not of the developers. For that you should understand  
exactly what the user was trying to do, what went wrong, and how to fix it  
- not only technically, but also professionally.  
264 | Microcopy for complex systems Example  
Following is an error message from the PTC AgileWorx system for managing  
work processes in an agile environment. In such an environment, the team  
works for set periods \(sprints\), and at the end of each sprint they should  
have completed all the stories assigned to them for that sprint and close  
them in the system. If the team decides to leave a story open, it needs to  
be reassigned to the next sprint.  
This error message appears when the group tries to close a sprint when  
there are still open stories assigned to it. The earlier version of the  
message provided a technical explanation to the users about how the system  
works, what it allows and doesn’t allow. The new version was written from  
the point of view of the users and with the professional understanding  
that what they want to do in an agile environment is to go back or to move  
the stories to the next sprint. Even the wording is more fluent, active,

Microcopy for complex systems | 265 6\. Empty states  
Empty states in complex system are golden opportunities to educate  
your users and let them know how the system works. Instead of leaving  
them at a dead end, use this vacant space to explain what they can or  
should do, how this feature is supposed to work, what should be here, or  
how to progress.  
# Examples  
Instead of a frustrating “Data is unavailable” \(or in other words “There’s  
nothing to see here”\), the RealMatch system tells the users what will be  
here, when, and what they should do now. In this example that is simply  
to wait.  
Note that despite the humane and friendly voice and tone of these messages,  
the professionalism of the brand is not harmed. On the contrary, the new  
sentence is much more professional, complete and precise.  
266 | Microcopy for complex systems But we've been doing it for 30 years now!  
Complex systems with hundreds of features and 30 years of experience  
in the market, provide users with what they have already learned and got  
used to. On the one hand it’s incredibly convenient, but on the other hand  
the gap between the interfaces they use outside of work and their expert  
system is widening. Outside of work they enjoy using new interfaces that  
are comfortable, written in contemporary language, and that are clear and  
interesting. Then a new work day begins, and they go back through the time  
tunnel to when their system was developed, with a language left over from  
the days when developers wrote all the microcopy, and everyone thought it  
was reasonable to let users decipher the logic of the system on their own.  
The problem with veteran expert systems is that it’s really hard to  
change the voice and tone legacy, and if you DO decide to change it -  
there’s no way all the features can be dealt with in one go, not visually  
and not the microcopy. On the other hand, if we change the microcopy only  
for the new features, it’ll create inconsistency within the system.  
So what can be done? If you want the system to advance at some point,  
you have to start somewhere\: write contemporary microcopy for every  
new feature, and update the microcopy for any old feature that is being  
updated to a new version. Naturally, you need to make sure that users are  
easily able to link between similar elements written for a new feature  
compared to the old, despite the voice and tone differences. Luckily, a  
change in a complex system can’t be so overwhelming anyway, because the  
professional terminology stays, even if the surroundings become more  
contemporary.  
Before starting this process of change, it is highly recommended to  
design a comprehensive voice and tone, and then decide what stays and  
what changes. This will ensure the continuity of the professional  
language and of the general character of the system and still enable  
regeneration. This process, in cooperation with different parts of  
the organization, will also facilitate the acceptance of change among  
employees and managers \(thanks to Shani Polanski of PTC for this  
important insight from her experience\).  
Microcopy for complex systems | 267 A captive audience is still a target audience  
Most complex systems have some level of competition, but the  
massive resources required to transfer a whole organization to a  
new system results in many organizations continuing to tolerate  
a reasonable or even a less than reasonable system for many long  
years, just so that they won’t need to go through the process of  
change. And there are systems where the audience is really captive,  
such as government agency systems, so why do we need to invest  
resources in improvement? They’ll manage, they have to.  
If you are concerned about user experience, and if you strive to  
provide your users with the best user experience just because that  
in itself is important enough to you, you’ll surely identify with  
the following sentence that Elinor Mishan Salomon, UX and UI team  
leader in the Israel Ministry of Justice, said to me that summarizes  
this whole chapter\:  
“Precisely because they are a captive audience! They want to work,  
and I want them not to get stuck without knowing what to do next.  
They shouldn’t leave frustrated. They should have tools that are  
not their best friend but can be relied on to work for them and not  
against them.”  
And if your users are happy, they use your system more, purchase  
add-ons, spread the word, and renew the contract. Here's your ROI.  
268 | Microcopy for complex systems Why complex systems need voice and tone design  
Writing microcopy doesn’t mean that you have to write funny or cute text,  
instead you should design a voice and tone that will suit your users and  
the context in which they operate \(see chapter 1\). In other words, it’s  
incorrect to say that correct and dry microcopy doesn’t have character, it  
does, but it is a dry and correct character, and when dealing with complex  
systems, it is quite possible that it’s exactly what your users need.  
Even more so if your users are exposed to a lot of uncertainty, pressure,  
responsibility, deadline or anxiety. Just give them microcopy that is as  
simple and clear as possible. This is the most empathic thing you can do  
for them, more than a sad smiley.  
Does this mean that complex, professional or business-to-business \(B2B\)  
systems need always to be serious and correct?  
Well, no, it doesn’t.  
# Make fun of work  
MailChimp runs a B2B system that is friendly, humane and funny with  
millions of business users. Here are two of their confirmation messages.  
And even their error messages are sometimes humorous\:  
MailChimp’s users are very reliant on the system\: we are talking about  
millions of businesses that use the system to manage their mailing lists  
Microcopy for complex systems | 269 and email campaigns. This also involves a high level of uncertainty, tough  
competition, apprehension, and technical complexity. And a lot of money  
is at stake. This is a serious subject, worrying, complex and critical.  
How come that MailChimp allows itself to be frivolous? And how come that  
their users are crazy about them? And how did their voice and tone design  
become the shining example for content writers?  
Fact. It is possible to be humane and friendly even in a psychologically  
complex and technically demanding environment.  
True, to do so successfully you need loads of sensitivity to the different  
scenarios that users face and the context in which every word is spoken,  
and a well-defined voice and tone. But it’s possible. Check out Slack for  
communicating within a team, and Trello for managing project teams. They  
did it too.  
A highly recommended B2B voice and tone design, that is super professional  
and contemporary, is the one for Salesforce. Just google “Salesforce  
voice and tone” and enjoy. Here are two appetizers\:

That doesn’t mean you must be liberated and light in every system,  
definitely not. However, there is no such thing as a single voice and tone  
that fits all professional or complex systems. The brand and its goals,  
the target audience, the relationship between them, and work environment  
alter it a lot. Whether you’re writing microcopy for consumers or experts,  
you always need to first specify the voice and tone. Yes, always.  
Luckily, there’s a full step-by-step guide to design your own voice and  
tone in Chapter 1 of this book you have just finished reading. It’s time  
to get to work.
