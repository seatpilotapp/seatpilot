Other Books You May Enjoy Preface  
Delivering high-performance applications is a nightmare. JavaScript is a dynamically  
typed language. Thus, the JavaScript engine assumes the type when executing JavaScript.  
These assumptions lead to unpredictable performance. This makes it even harder to  
deliver consistently high-performance applications in JavaScript.  
WebAssembly provides a way to run type-safe and high-performance applications in the  
JavaScript engine.  
WebAssembly is blazingly fast  
WebAssembly is the next great thing that happened in the web. It promises high and  
consistent performance with maintainable code, running native code and providing near-  
native performance on the web.  
WebAssembly is type-safe  
The JavaScript compiler struggles to provide high performance when you have  
polymorphic JavaScript code. WebAssembly, on the other hand, is type-safe \(or  
monomorphic\) at compile time. This not only boosts performance but also greatly reduces  
runtime errors, which is a win-win.  
WebAssembly runs your native code  
There have been multiple attempts to make the web faster by running native code. But  
they all failed because they are either vendor-specific or tied to a single language. The web  
is built on top of open standards. By being an open standard, WebAssembly makes it easy  
for all companies to adopt and support it. WebAssembly is not a language; it is a high-level  
implementation plan for other languages that compile to byte code that will run on the  
JavaScript engines. xii Preface  
WebAssembly is byte code  
WebAssembly is nothing but a bytecode that runs in JavaScript Engine. In this book,  
we will learn how to convert native code into WebAssembly and how to optimize it to get  
even better performance. We will also cover how the entire WebAssembly runs on the  
JavaScript engine and how to use the various tools available and what they help us  
to achieve.  
Most importantly, learn where and how to use WebAssembly to get the desired result out  
of it.  
Let's make the web even more awesome and faster with WebAssembly.  
# Who this book is for

# Understanding LLVM  
JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. However, JavaScript has  
two main disadvantages\:  
•  
•  
Unpredictable performance  
JavaScript executes inside the environment and runtime provided by JavaScript  
engines. There are various JavaScript engines \(V8, WebKit, and Gecko\). All of them  
were built differently and run the same JavaScript code in a different way. Added to  
that, JavaScript is dynamically typed. This means JavaScript engines should guess  
the type while executing the JavaScript code. These factors lead to unpredictable  
performance in JavaScript execution. The optimizations for one type of JavaScript  
engine may cause undesirable side effects on other types of JavaScript engines. This  
leads to unpredictable performance.  
Bundle size  
The JavaScript engine waits until it downloads the entire JavaScript file before  
parsing and executing. The larger the JavaScript file, the longer the wait will be.  
This will degrade your application's performance. Bundlers such as webpack help to  
minimize the bundle size. But when your application grows, the bundle size grows  
exponentially.  
Is there a tool that provides native performance and comes in a much smaller size?  
Yes, WebAssembly. 4 Understanding LLVM  
WebAssembly is the future of web and node development. WebAssembly is statically  
typed and precompiled, and thus it provides better performance than JavaScript.  
Precompilation of the binary provides an option to generate tiny binary bundles.  
WebAssembly allows languages such as Rust, C, and C++ to be compiled into binaries that  
run inside the JavaScript engine along with JavaScript. All WebAssembly compilers use  
LLVM underneath to convert the native code into WebAssembly binary code. Thus, it is  
important to understand what LLVM is and how it works.  
In this chapter, we will learn what the various components of a compiler are and how  
they work. Then, we will explore what LLVM is and how it helps the compiled languages.  
Finally, we will see how the LLVM compiler compiles native code. We will cover the  
following topics in this chapter\:

# Understanding compilers  
Programming languages are broadly classified into compiled and interpreted languages.  
In the compiled world, the code is first compiled into target machine code. This process of  
converting the code into binary is called compilation. The software program that converts  
the code into target machine code is called a compiler. During the compilation, the  
compiler runs a series of checks, passes, and validation on the code written and generates  
an efficient and optimized binary. A few examples of compiled languages are C, C++,  
and Rust. Understanding compilers 5  
In the interpreted world, the code is read and executed in a single pass. Since the  
compilation happens at runtime, the generated machine code is not as optimized as its  
compiled counterpart. Interpreted languages are significantly slower than compiled ones,  
but they provide dynamic typing and a smaller program size.  
In this book, we will focus only on compiled languages.  
# Compiled languages  
A compiler is a translator that translates source code into machine code \(or in a more  
abstract way, converts the code from one programming language to another\). A compiler  
is complicated because it should understand the language in which the source code is  
written \(its syntax, semantics, and context\); it should also understand the target machine  
code \(its syntax, semantics, and context\) and should create a representation that maps the  
source code into the target machine code.  
A compiler has the following components\:  
•  
•  
•  
Frontend – The frontend is responsible for handling the source language.  
Optimizer – The optimizer is responsible for optimizing the code.  
Backend – The backend is responsible for handling the target language.  
Figure 1.1 – Components of a compiler  
Frontend  
The frontend focuses on handling the source language. The frontend parses the code  
upon receiving it. The code is then checked for any grammar or syntax issues. After that,  
the code is converted \(mapped\) into an intermediate representation \(IR\). Consider IR  
as a format that represents the code that the compiler processes. The IR is the compiler's  
version of your code. 6 Understanding LLVM  
Optimizer  
The second component in the compiler is the optimizer. This is optional, but as the name  
indicates, the optimizer analyzes the IR and transforms it into a much more efficient  
one. Few compilers have multiple IRs. The compiler efficiently optimizes the code on  
every pass over the IR. The optimizer is an IR-to-IR transformer. The optimizer analyzes,  
runs passes, and rewrites the IR. The optimizations here include removing redundant  
computations, eliminating dead code \(code that cannot be reached\), and various other  
optimizing options, which will be explored in future chapters. It is important to note that  
the optimizers need not be language-specific. Since they act on the IR, they can be built as  
a generic component and reused with multiple languages.  
Backend  
The backend focuses on producing the target language. The backend receives the  
generated \(optimized\) IR and converts it into another language \(such as machine code\).  
It is also possible to chain multiple backends that convert the code into some other  
languages. The backend is responsible for generating the target machine code from the  
IR. This machine code is the actual code that runs on the bare metal. In order to produce  
efficient machine code, the backend should understand the architecture in which the code  
is executed.  
Machine code is a set of instructions that instructs the machine to store some values  
in registers and do some computation on them. For example, the generated machine  
code is responsible for efficiently storing a 64-bit number in 32-bit architecture in a free  
register \(and things like that\). The backend should understand the target environment to  
efficiently create a set of instructions and properly select and schedule the instructions to  
increase the performance of the application execution.  
# Compiler efficiency  
The faster the execution, the better the performance.  
The efficiency of the compiler depends on how it selects the instruction, allocates the  
register, and schedules the instruction execution in the given architecture. An instruction  
set is a set of operations supported by a processor, and this overall design is called an  
Instruction Set Architecture \(ISA\). The ISA is an abstract model of a computer and is  
often referred to as computer architecture. Various processors convert the ISA in different  
implementations. The different implementations may vary in performance. The ISA is an  
interface between the hardware and the software. Exploring LLVM 7  
If you are implementing a new programming language and you want this language to  
be running on different architectures \(or, more abstractly, different processors\), then  
you should build the backend for each of these architectures/targets. But building these  
backends for every architecture is difficult and will take time, cost, and effort to embark  
on a language creation journey.  
What if we create a common IR and build a compiler that converts this IR into machine  
code that runs efficiently on various architecture? Let's call this compiler a low-level  
virtual machine. Now, the role of your frontend in the compiler chain is just to convert  
the source code into an IR that is compatible with a low-level virtual machine \(such  
as LLVM\). Now, the general purpose of a low-level virtual machine is to be a common  
reusable component that maps the IR into native code for various targets. But the  
low-level virtual machine will only understand the common IR. This IR is called the  
LLVM IR and the compiler is called LLVM.  
# Exploring LLVM  
LLVM is a part of the LLVM Project. The LLVM Project hosts compilers and toolchain  
technologies. The LLVM core is a part of the LLVM Project. The LLVM core is responsible  
for providing source- and target-independent optimization and for generating code for  
many CPU architectures. This enables language developers to just create a frontend that  
generates an LLVM-compatible IR or LLVM IR from the source language.  
Did You Know?  
LLVM is not an acronym. When the project was started as a research project, it  
meant Low-Level Virtual Machine. But later, it was decided to use the name as  
it is rather than as an acronym.  
The main advantages of LLVM are as follows\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
LLVM uses a simple low-level language that looks similar to C.  
LLVM is strongly typed.  
LLVM has strictly defined semantics.  
LLVM has accurate and precise garbage collection.  
LLVM provides various optimizations that you can choose based on the  
requirement. It has aggressive, scalar, inter-procedural, simple-loop, and  
profile-driven optimizations. 8 Understanding LLVM  
•  
•  
•  
LLVM provides various compilation models. They are link time, install time,  
runtime, and offline.  
LLVM generates machine code for various target architectures.  
LLVM provides DWARF debugging information.  
Note  
DWARF is a debugging file format used by many compilers and debuggers  
to support source-level debugging. DWARF is architecture-independent and  
applicable to any processor or operating system. It uses a data structure called  
a Debugging Information Entry \(DIE\) to represent each variable, type,  
procedure, and so on.  
If you want to explore more about DWARF, refer to http\://dwarfstd.  
org/doc/Debugging%20using%20DWARF-2012.pdf.  
Important Note  
LLVM is not a single monolithic project. It is a collection of subprojects and  
other projects. These projects are used by various languages, such as Ruby,  
Python, Haskell, Rust, and D, for compilation.  
Now that we have an understanding of compilers and LLVM, we will see how it is used.  
# LLVM in action  
In this section, let's use LLVM's Clang compiler to compile native code into LLVM IR.  
This will give a better idea of how LLVM works and will be useful for understanding how  
the compilers use LLVM in future chapters.  
We first create a C file called sum.c and enter the following contents\:  
\$ touch sum.c  
// sum.c  
unsigned sum\(unsigned a, unsigned b\) \{  
return a + b;  
\} LLVM in action 9  
The sum.c file contains a simple sum function that takes in two unsigned integers and  
returns the sum of them. LLVM provides the Clang LLVM compiler to compile the C  
source code. In order to generate the LLVM IR, run the following command\:  
\$ clang -S -O3 -emit-llvm sum.c  
We provided the Clang compiler with the -S, -O3, and -emit-llvm options\:  
•  
•  
•  
The -S option specifies for the compiler to only run the preprocess and compilation  
steps.  
The -O3 option specifies for the compiler to generate a well-optimized binary.  
The -emit-llvm option specifies for the compiler to emit the LLVM IR while  
generating the machine code.  
The preceding code will print out the following LLVM IR\:  
define i32 @sum\(i32, i32\) local\_unnamed\_addr \#0 \{  
%3 = add i32 %1, %0  
ret i32 %3  
\}  
The syntax of the LLVM IR is structurally much closer to C. The define keyword defines  
the beginning of a function. Next to that is the return type of the function, i32. Next, we  
have the name of the function, @sum.  
Important Note  
Note the @ symbol there? LLVM uses @ to identify the global variables and  
function. It uses % to identify the local variables.  
After the function name, we state the types of the input argument \(i32 in this case\).  
The local\_unnamed\_addr attribute indicates that the address is known not to be  
significant within the module. The variables in the LLVM IR are immutable. That is, once  
you define them, you cannot change them. So inside the \`block\`, we create a new local  
value, %3, and assign it the value of add. add is an opcode that takes in the \`type\` of the  
arguments followed by the two arguments, %0 and %1. %0 and %1 denote the first and  
second local variables. Finally, we return %3 with the ret keyword followed by the \`type\`.  
This IR is transformable; that is, the IR can be transformed from the textual representation  
into memory and then into actual bit code that run on the bare metal. Also, from bit code,  
you can transform them back to the textual representation. 10 Understanding LLVM  
Imagine that you are writing a new language. The success of the language depends on how  
versatile the language is at performing on various architectures. Generating optimized  
byte codes for various architectures \(such as x86, ARM, and others\) takes a long time and  
it is not easy. LLVM provides an easy way to achieve it. Instead of targeting the different  
architecture, create a compiler frontend that converts the source code into an LLVM  
compatible IR. Then, LLVM will convert the IR into efficient and optimized byte code that  
runs on any architecture.  
Note  
LLVM is an umbrella project. It has so many components that you could write  
a set of books on them. Covering the whole of LLVM and how to install and  
run them is beyond the scope of this book. If you are interested in learning  
more about various components of LLVM, how they work, and how to use  
them, then check out the website\: https\://llvm.org.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we have seen how compiled languages work and how LLVM helps to  
compile them. We have compiled a sample program with LLVM to understand how it  
works. In the next chapter, we'll explore Emscripten, a tool that converts C/C++ into a  
WebAssembly module. Emscripten uses the LLVM backend to do the compilation. 2  
# Understanding  
# Emscripten  
In this chapter, we will learn about Emscripten, which is a toolchain to convert C/C++  
code into a WebAssembly module.  
Emscripten consists of two components\:  
•  
•  
Emscripten compiler frontend  
Emscripten SDK \(emsdk\) 12 Understanding Emscripten  
The Clang compiler frontend compiles C/C++ code into LLVM intermediate  
representation \(LLVM IR\) and then uses the LLVM backend to convert the LLVM IR  
into native code. The Clang compiler is fast, uses little memory, and is compatible with  
GNU Compiler Collection \(GCC\). Emscripten is similar to Clang; the former produces a  
wasm binary while the latter produces a native binary. The Emscripten compiler frontend  
\(emcc\) is the compiler frontend that converts C/C++ into LLVM IR \(both binary and  
human-readable form\) and into the WebAssembly binary or asm.js, such as JavaScript.  
Figure 2.1 – Emscripten compiler frontend  
emsdk helps manage and maintain the Emscripten toolchain components and set up the  
runtime/terminal environment to run emcc.  
In this chapter, we will learn how to install Emscripten. Then, we will use Emscripten to  
generate asm.js, a WebAssembly module that runs on Node.js and the browser. After that,  
we will explore the emsdk tool. Finally, we will explore various optimizations provided by  
Emscripten. We will cover the following topics in this chapter\:

Understanding various levels of optimizations  
Did You Know?  
asm.js is a subset of JavaScript that is optimized to run at near-native  
performance in the browser. The asm.js spec was not accepted by all browser  
vendors. asm.js has evolved into WebAssembly. Technical requirements 13  
# Technical requirements  
We will be showing how to set up Emscripten in this chapter, for which you will require  
the following installed on your system\:  
•  
•  
Python \>= 3.7  
Node.js \> 12.18  
Note  
emsdk comes prebundled with a compatible Node.js version.  
You can find the code files present in this chapter on GitHub at https\://github.

# Installing Emscripten using emsdk  
emsdk provides an easy way to install, manage, and switch versions of the Emscripten  
toolchain. emsdk takes care of setting up the environment, tools, and SDK required  
for compiling C/C++ to LLVM IR and then to JavaScript in the form of asm.js or the  
WebAssembly binary.  
Let's install Emscripten and start hacking\:  
1\. Clone the emsdk repo and go into the emsdk folder\:  
\$ git clone https\://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk  
\$ cd emsdk  
2\. To install emsdk on the machine, run the following command\:  
For \*nix users, use the following\:  
\$ ./emsdk install latest  
For Windows users, use the following\:  
\$ emsdk install latest  
Note  
The preceding command might take a while to run; it will build and set up the  
entire toolchain. 14 Understanding Emscripten  
Next, we will activate the latest emsdk. The activation updates the local shell with the  
necessary environment references and makes the latest SDK active for the user in the  
current shell. It writes the path and other necessary information for the Emscripten  
toolchain to work under the user's home directory in a file called .emscripten\:  
3\. To activate the installed emsdk, run the following command\:  
For \*nix users, use the following\:  
\$ ./emsdk activate latest  
For Windows users, use the following\:  
\$ emsdk activate latest  
4\. Now it is time to make sure the configurations and paths are activated by running  
the following\:  
For \*nix users, use the following\:  
\$ source ./emsdk\_env.sh  
For Windows users, use the following\:  
\$ emsdk\_env.bat  
Congrats, the Emscripten toolchain is installed! Updating the toolchain with emsdk is as  
easy as installing it.  
To update, run the following command\:  
For \*nix users, use the following\:  
\$ ./emsdk update  
For Windows users, use the following\:  
\$ emsdk update  
emsdk sets up the following paths inside the Emscripten configuration file. The  
Emscripten configuration file \(.emscripten\) is in the home folder. It consists of the  
following\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
LLVM\_ROOT – specifies the path of the LLVM Clang compiler  
NODE\_JS – specifies the path of Node.js  
BINARYEN\_ROOT – specifies the optimizer for the Emscripten compiler  
EMSCRIPTEN\_ROOT – specifies the path of the Emscripten compiler Generating asm.js using Emscripten 15  
We can check whether the installation of emcc was successful by using the following  
command\:  
\$ emcc --version  
Now that we have finished installing the Emscripten compiler, let's go ahead and use it.  
# Generating asm.js using Emscripten  
We will use Emscripten to port C/C++ programs into asm.js or the WebAssembly binary  
and then run them inside the JavaScript engine.  
Note  
Programming languages such as Lua and Python have a C/C++ runtime. With  
Emscripten, we can port the runtime as a WebAssembly module and execute  
them inside the JavaScript engine. This makes it easy to run Lua/Python  
code on the JavaScript engine. Thus, Emscripten and WebAssembly allow the  
running of native code in the JavaScript engine.  
First, let's create a sum.cpp file\:  
// sum.cpp  
extern "C" \{  
unsigned sum\(unsigned a, unsigned b\) \{  
return a + b;  
\}  
\}  
Consider extern "C" as something like an export mechanism. All the functions inside  
are available as an exported function without any changes to their name. Then, we define  
the normal sum function that takes in two numbers and returns a number.  
In order to generate the asm.js like JavaScript code from sum.cpp, use the following  
command\:  
\$ emcc -O1 ./sum.cpp -o sum.html -s WASM=0 -s EXPORTED\_  
FUNCTIONS='\["\_sum"\]'  
Note  
If you are running emcc for the first time, it might take a few seconds to  
complete. Subsequent runs will be faster. 16 Understanding Emscripten  
We pass in the -O1 option to the emcc compiler, instructing the compiler to produce less-  
optimized code \(we will see more options to optimize later in this chapter\). Next, we pass  
the file to be converted, that is, sum.cpp. Then, with the -o flag, we provide the desired  
name for the output, which is sum.html.  
Finally, we send in more information to the emcc compiler using the -s flag. The  
-s flag takes in a key and value as their arguments. The emcc compiler generates the  
WebAssembly module by default. WASM=0 instructs the compiler to generate asm.js like  
JavaScript instead of WebAssembly.  
Then, we specify the exported functions using the EXPORTED\_FUNCTIONS option. The  
EXPORTED\_FUNCTIONS option takes an array of arguments. In order to export the sum  
function, we specify \_sum.  
This will generate the following code\:  
function \_sum\(\$0,\$1\) \{  
\$0 = \$0|0;  
\$1 = \$1|0;  
var \$2 = 0, label = 0, sp = 0;  
sp = STACKTOP;  
\$2 = \(\(\$1\) + \(\$0\)\)|0;  
return \(\$2|0\);  
\}  
Note  
|0 specifies the type as a number.  
Now open sum.html in a browser and open the developer console. In order to call the  
exported function, we will run the following expression in the console\:  
ccall\("sum", "number", "number, number", \[10, 20\]\)  
// outputs 30  
ccall is the way to call the exported function from C/C++ code via JavaScript.  
The function takes in the name of the function, the type of the return value, types of  
arguments, and then the input arguments as an array. This will invoke the sum function  
to produce the result. We will see more about ccall and cwrap in later chapters. But for  
now, consider ccall a way to call the C function. Running Hello World with Emscripten in Node.js 17  
Find out more about the Emscripten source at https\://github.com/emscripten-  
core/emscripten.  
So far, we have seen how to generate asm.js files using emscripten. Let us use emscripten  
to create a WebAssembly Module to run on Node.js.  
# Running Hello World with Emscripten  
# in Node.js  
In this section, we will see how to convert C/C++ code into the WebAssembly binary via  
Emscripten and run it along with Node.js.  
Note  
If the terminal errors out with emcc command not found, your terminal  
environment might have been reset. To set up the environment, run the  
following command from inside the emsdk folder\:  
source ./emsdk\_env.sh  
Let's follow the tradition of Brian Kernighan, by writing "Hello, world" with a slight twist.  
Let's do a "Hello, Web"\:  
1\. First, we create a hello\_web.c file\:  
\$ touch hello\_web.c  
2\. Launch your favorite editor and add the following code\:  
\#include \<stdio.h\>  
int main\(\) \{  
printf\("Hello, Web!\\n"\);  
return 0;  
\}  
It is a simple C program with a main function. The main function is the entry  
point during the runtime. When this code is compiled and executed using Clang  
\(clang sum.c && ./a.out\), "Hello, Web!" is printed. Now, instead of Clang  
\(or any other compiler\), let's compile the code with emcc. 18 Understanding Emscripten  
3\. We enter the following command to compile the code with emcc\:  
\$ emcc hello\_web.c  
4\. Once completed, the following files are generated\:  
 a.out.js  
 a.out.wasm  
The generated JavaScript file is huge. It has more than 2,000 lines and is 109 KB in  
size. We will learn how to optimize the file size later in this chapter.  
Let's run the generated JavaScript file using Node and that will print out  
"Hello, Web!"\:  
\$ node a.out.js  
Hello, Web!  
Congratulations! You just ran your first WebAssembly binary!  
Note  
Binary size matters in the world of browsers. It won't matter if your algorithm  
runs in nanoseconds if you have a huge chunk of code. The browser waits till it  
receives all the necessary information before it starts to parse and compile. So,  
it is mandatory to check the file size. Closure Compiler helps to minimize the  
byte code size further. Closure Compiler not only reduces the code size but also  
tries to make the code more efficient.  
The generated JavaScript file contains its own runtime and configuration needed for the  
JavaScript engine to execute the WebAssembly module inside the JavaScript engine. The  
generated JavaScript file creates a JavaScript module and initializes code for both browsers  
and Node.js\:  
•  
•  
In Node.js, the generated JavaScript file creates a module by reading the file from  
the local filesystem. It gets the arguments passed to the node command and sets  
them up in the module created.  
In browsers, the generated JavaScript file creates a module by framing a request and  
fetches it as bytes from a URL. The browser fetches the WebAssembly binary from  
the hosted server or location and then instantiates the module.  
The generated JavaScript file also creates a stack, memory, import, and export sections. We  
will deep dive into those sections later in this book. Running Hello World with Emscripten in Node.js 19  
This generated JavaScript file is called a binding file. The main function of the binding  
file is to create or set an environment that enables executing a WebAssembly module  
inside the JavaScript engine. The binding file acts as a translator between JavaScript and  
WebAssembly. All the values are passed in and out via this binding file.  
When the JavaScript file is executed via node, it does the following.  
The JavaScript engine first loads the module and then sets up the constants and various  
functions that are required for WebAssembly to execute. Then, the module checks where  
the code is being executed, whether the module is inside the browser or in the \`Node\`  
environment. Based on that, it fetches the file. Since we are running the WebAssembly  
Module via the node here, it fetches the file from the local filesystem. Then, the module is  
checked for any arguments provided for the call. If not, the JavaScript engine will check  
whether there are any unhandled/uncaught exceptions. The JavaScript engine then maps  
the print out/print err function to the console. The JavaScript engine checks  
whether the module loaded has all the required access and global variables and imports  
are available for execution.  
The module goes on to initialize the stack and other required constants as well as the  
decoder and encoder for decoding and encoding the buffer, respectively. The encoder  
is responsible for translating the JavaScript values into WebAssembly-understandable  
values. The decoder is responsible for translating the WebAssembly values into JavaScript-  
understandable values.  
The Node.js runtime then checks the availability of the file and then initializes the file. The  
module is checked for all the WebAssembly-related function availability. Once everything  
is initialized and the module contains all the functions required, we will call the run  
function.  
The run function instantiates the WebAssembly binary. In this case, since we have defined  
the main function in C, the binding file calls the main function straight away when  
instantiated.  
The binding file contains the ccall function. The ccall function is an interface to the  
underlying function defined in C\:  
function ccall\(ident, returnType, argTypes, args, opts\) \{  
// the code is elided  
\} 20 Understanding Emscripten  
The ccall function accepts the following arguments\:  
•  
ident – The function to call; it is the function identifier defined in C.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
returnType – The return type of the function.  
argTypes – The argument types.  
args – The arguments that are passed along with the function call.  
opts – Any other options that are required.  
The JavaScript module exports the cwrap function in addition to ccall. cwrap is a  
wrapper function around the ccall function. While ccall is a function invocation,  
cwrap provides a function that invokes ccall\:  
function cwrap\(ident, returnType, argTypes, opts\) \{  
return function\(\) \{  
return ccall\(ident, returnType, argTypes,  
arguments, opts\);  
\}  
\}  
The WebAssembly file generated consists of binary opcode to instruct the runtime to print  
"Hello, Web!". The WebAssembly file starts with 00 61 73 6d 01 00 00 00.  
Find out more about WebAssembly specifications at https\://webassembly.  
github.io/spec/.  
So far, we have seen how to generate a WebAssembly module to run on Node.js. Let us use  
emscripten to create a WebAssembly Module to run in the browser.  
# Running Hello World with Emscripten in  
# the browser  
In this section, we will see how to convert C/C++ code into the WebAssembly binary via  
Emscripten and run it in the browser. Running Hello World with Emscripten in the browser 21  
Note  
If the terminal says that the emcc command is not found, it is highly likely  
that you have missed setting up the environment variables. To set up the  
environment variables, run the following command from inside the emsdk  
folder\: source ./emsdk\_env.sh  
Let's use the same code example used in the Generating asm.js using Emscripten section .  
Now, instead of just running emcc, let's pass the -o option and instruct emcc to generate  
the .html file\:  
\$ emcc hello\_web.c -o helloweb.html  
Once completed, the following files are generated\:  
•  
helloweb.js  
•  
helloweb.wasm  
•  
helloweb.html  
Similar to the Node example, the generated JavaScript file is huge. We will learn how to  
optimize the file size later in this chapter.  
Note  
The -o option ensures all the files generated have the name helloweb.  
In order to run the generated HTML file in the browser, we will need a web server. The  
web server serves the HTML file over the HTTP protocol. Explaining web servers and  
how they work is beyond the scope of this book; refer to https\://en.wikipedia.  
org/wiki/Web\_server for more details.  
Python provides an easy way to run the web server. In order to run the web server using  
Python, run the following command\:  
\$ python -m http.server \<port number\> 22 Understanding Emscripten  
Open http\://localhost\:\<port number\> to see WebAssembly in action in the  
browser.  
Figure 2.2 – Browser running WebAssembly  
When the JavaScript file is executed via the browser, it prints out Hello, Web! as output.  
The only difference is instead of loading the WASM file from the filesystem, it loads it via  
XHR. Once everything is initialized and the module consists of all the functions required,  
we will call the run function. The run function instantiates the WebAssembly binary. In  
this case, since we have defined the main function in C, the binding file calls the main  
function straight away when instantiated.  
Emscripten also provides emrun to run HTML files. Check out https\://  
emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Running-html-files-with-emrun.  
html for more information.  
Find out more about deploying Emscripten-compiled pages at https\://emscripten.  
org/docs/compiling/Deploying-Pages.html.  
We have used Emscripten to generate the WebAssembly module. Let's go ahead and  
explore what else the emsdk can do.  
# Exploring other options in emsdk  
emsdk is a single-stop shop for installing, maintaining, and managing all the tools  
and toolchains required for using Emscripten. emsdk makes it easier to bootstrap  
the environment, upgrade to the latest versions, switch to various versions, change or  
configure various tools, and so on. Exploring other options in emsdk 23  
The emsdk command is available inside the emsdk folder. Go to the emsdk folder and  
run the emsdk command.  
Note  
For all the commands in this chapter, for \*nix systems, use ./emsdk, and for  
Windows, use emsdk.  
To find the various options available in the emsdk command, run the following  
command\:  
\$ ./emsdk --help  
emsdk\: Available commands\:  
emsdk list \[--old\] \[--uses\] - To list down the tools  
emsdk update - To update the emsdk to the latest version.  
emsdk update-tags - To fetch the latest tags from the GitHub  
repository.  
emsdk install - To install the tools and SDK.  
emsdk uninstall - To uninstall the tools and SDK installed  
previously.  
emsdk activate - To activate the currently installed version.  
An emsdk command takes the following format\:  
emsdk \<option\> \<Tool / SDK \> --\<flags\>  
The emsdk command consists of the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
\<option\>  
This can be one of the following\: list, update, update-tags, install, uninstall, or  
activate.  
\<Tool/SDK\>  
This refers to libraries and it includes Emscripten and LLVM. SDK refers to emsdk  
itself.  
--\<flags\>  
This refers to various configuration options.  
Let us explore each of the options and flags that emsdk command supports. 24 Understanding Emscripten  
# Listing the tools and SDK  
Here, we show how to list the tools and SDK that are available with emsdk. Run the  
following command\:  
\$ ./emsdk list  
The \*recommended\* precompiled SDK download is 2.0.6  
\(4ba921c8c8fe2e8cae071ca9889d5c27f5debd87\).  
To install/activate it, use one of\:  
latest \[default \(llvm\) backend\]  
latest-fastcomp \[legacy \(fastcomp\) backend\]  
Those are equivalent to installing/activating the following\:  
2.0.6 INSTALLED  
2.0.6-fastcomp  
All recent \(non-legacy\) installable versions are\:  
2.0.6 INSTALLED  
...  
The additional following precompiled SDKs are also available  
for download\:  
sdk-fastcomp-1.38.31-64bit  
The following SDKs can be compiled from source\:  
sdk-upstream-master-64bit  
...  
The following precompiled tool packages are available for  
download\:  
...  
\* node-12.18.1-64bit INSTALLED  
\* python-3.7.4-2-64bit INSTALLED  
emscripten-1.38.30  
...  
The following tools can be compiled from source\: Exploring other options in emsdk 25  
llvm  
clang  
emscripten  
binaryen  
Items marked with \* are activated for the current user.  
To access the historical archived versions, type 'emsdk list  
--old'  
Run "git pull" followed by "./emsdk update-tags" to pull  
in the latest list.  
emsdk list lists all tool packages and SDKs that are available. This list of tools and  
SDKs includes the last few versions of LLVM, Clang, Emscripten, and Binaryen. They  
even have Node versions 8 and 12 and Python 3.7. emsdk maintains and manages emsdk.  
This means that we need to know the information about the current version that we are  
using and how to update it. The emsdk list command also provides more detail on the  
SDK components along with a list of those compiled from the sources.  
# Managing the tools and SDK  
emsdk provides an option to install, update, and uninstall the tools and SDK.  
In order to install the tools, SDK, or emsdk itself, use the following\:  
\$ ./emsdk install \<tool / SDK to install\>  
To install the latest version of the SDK, you can run the following\:  
./emsdk install latest  
Note  
latest refers to the latest version of emsdk.  
To install multiple tools with the emsdk install command, use the following\:  
./emsdk install \<tool1\> \<tool2\> \<tool3\> 26 Understanding Emscripten  
You can also specify multiple options for the install command. You can pass in options  
to the install command like this\:  
./emsdk install \[options\] \<tools / SDK\>  
The various options available are as follows\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Number of cores to build  
Type of build  
Activation of tools and SDK  
Uninstallation  
Number of cores to build  
The initial setup will take a long time to build and install the required tools and SDK.  
Based on your requirements, you can control the number of cores that you need for  
building and installing the required tools and SDK\:  
./emsdk install -j\<number of cores to use for building\> \<tools  
/ SDK\>  
Type of build  
You instruct emsdk on what type of build is to be used to make LLVM perform\:  
./emsdk install --build=\<type\> \<tools / SDK\>  
type accepts the following options\:  
•  
•  
Debug  
 This type is used for debugging.  
 It generates Symbol files.  
 The end build will not produce optimized, fast code.  
Release  
 This type will generate optimized, fast code. Exploring other options in emsdk 27  
•  
MinSizeRel  
 This type is the same as Release.  
 This type will minimize the size and maximize the speed.  
 This uses optimization options such as -O1 \(minimize size\) and -O2  
\(maximize speed\).  
•  
RelWithDebInfo  
 This type is the same as Release.  
 This type will also generate Symbol files. That will help in debugging.  
Activation of the tools and SDK  
After the tools and SDK are installed, we can activate different versions to use them. The  
activate command generates the necessary configuration files mapping the path, with  
the built executables.  
To activate the tools and SDK, run the following\:  
./emsdk activate \<tools / SDK to activate\>  
The activate command accepts a few options; they are as follows\:  
•  
•  
--embedded – This option makes sure all the built files, configuration, cache, and  
temporary files are located inside the directory in which the emsdk command  
is located.  
If not specified, this command will move the configuration file to the user's  
home directory.  
--build=\<type\> – Similar to the type of build that LLVM supports. For  
example, Debug, Release, MinSizeRel, RelWithDebInfo.  
Uninstallation of the tools and SDK  
To uninstall the tools and SDK, we can run the following\:  
./emsdk uninstall \< tools / SDK to uninstall\>  
Find out more about the tools at https\://emscripten.org/docs/tools\_  
reference/index.html. 28 Understanding Emscripten  
We have explored how emsdk helps us to manage tools and SDKs; let's go ahead and  
explore various optimizations provided by Emscripten.  
# Understanding various levels of optimizations  
C/C++ programs are compiled and converted into native code via Clang or the GCC  
compiler. Clang or the GCC compiler converts the C/C++ program based on the target.  
Target here refers to the end machine where the code is executed. emcc has the Clang  
compiler built in. The emcc compiler is responsible for converting the C or C++ source  
code into LLVM byte code.  
In this section, we will see how to improve the optimization and code size of the generated  
WebAssembly binary code.  
To improve the efficiency and generated code size, the Emscripten compiler has the  
following options\:  
•  
•  
Optimizations  
Closure Compiler  
Lets talk about optimizations first.  
# Optimizations  
The goal of the compiler is to reduce the cost of compilation, that is, the compile time.  
With the -O optimization flag, the compiler tries to improve the code size and/or the  
performance at the expense of the compile time. In terms of compiler optimizations, code  
size and performance are mutually exclusive. The faster the compile time, the lower the  
optimization. To specify the optimization, we use the -O\<0/1/2/3/s/z\> flag. Each of  
the options includes various assertions, code size optimizations, and code performance  
optimizations, along with others.  
The following are the various optimizations available\:  
•  
-O0 – This is the default option and a perfect starter to experiment. This option  
means "no optimizations." This optimization level compiles the fastest and generates  
the most debuggable code. This is a basic optimization level. This option tries to  
inline functions.  
•  
-O1 – This option adds simple optimizations and tries to generate a minimum  
code size. This option removes runtime assertions in the generated code and builds  
slower than the -O0 option. This option also tries to simplify the loops. Understanding various levels of optimizations 29  
•  
-O2 – This option adds further optimizations than -O1. It is slower than -O1 but  
generates code that is more optimized than the -O1 option. This option optimizes  
the code based on JavaScript optimization and removes code that is not part of  
JavaScript modules. This option removes the inline functions and the vectorize-  
loop option is set. This option adds a moderate level of optimization. This option  
also adds dead code elimination.  
•  
•  
•  
Vectorization will instruct the processor to do the operation in chunks rather than  
doing it one by one.  
-O3 – This option adds more options, takes more time to compile, and generates  
more optimized code than the -O2 option.  
This option produces optimal production-ready code. This option is like -O2,  
except that it enables optimizations that take longer to perform or that may generate  
larger code \(in an attempt to make the program run faster\).  
-Os – This option is similar to -O2. It adds extra optimizations and reduces the  
code size. Reducing the code size in turn decreases the performance. This option  
generates smaller code than -O2.  
-Oz – This option is similar to -Os but reduces the code size even further. This  
option takes more compile time to generate the binary code.  
We will now explore the various optimization options provided by Emscripten\:  
1\. First, we create a C file called optimization\_check\:  
\$ touch optimization\_check.c  
2\. Then, open your favorite editor and add the following code. The following is a  
simple C file with a main function and a couple of other functions\:  
\#include \<stdio.h\>  
int addSame\(int a\) \{  
return a + a;  
\}  
int add\(int a, int b\) \{  
return a + b;  
\}  
int main\(\) \{  
printf\("Hello, Web!\\n"\); 30 Understanding Emscripten  
int a;  
int sum = 0;  
/\* for loop execution \*/  
for\( a = 0; a \< 20; a = a + 1 \)\{  
sum = sum + a;  
\}  
addSame\(sum\);  
add\(1, 2\);  
return 0;  
\}  
3\. We then compile this into WebAssembly code using emcc\:  
\$ time emcc optimization\_check.c  
emcc optimization\_check.c 0.32s user 0.14s system  
90% cpu 0.514 total  
4\. Then, check the sizes of the file generated\:  
\$ l  
324B optimization\_check.c  
13K a.out.wasm  
109K a.out.js  
5\. We can see that the WebAssembly file generated is about 13 KB and it took a total of  
0.514 seconds to compile. That is a fast compilation but the code size is huge.  
In the world of compilers, the faster the compilation, the bigger the code size and  
the slower the execution speed will be.  
Now, let's optimize it further using the -O1 option\:  
\$ time emcc -O1 optimization\_check.c  
emcc -O1 optimization\_check.c 0.31s user 0.13s system  
86% cpu 0.519 total  
Check the sizes of the file generated\:  
\$ l  
324B optimization\_check.c  
3.4K a.out.wasm  
59K a.out.js 6\. 7. 8. Understanding various levels of optimizations 31  
The WebAssembly file generated is about 3.4 KB \(3.8 times less than the -O0  
version\) and it took almost the same time, around 0.519 seconds.  
Now, let's optimize it further using the -O2 option\:  
\$ time emcc -O2 optimization\_check.c  
emcc -O2 optimization\_check.c 0.53s user 0.16s system  
111% cpu 0.620 total  
Check the sizes of the file generated\:  
\$ l  
324B optimization\_check.c  
2K a.out.wasm  
20K a.out.js  
The WebAssembly file generated is about 2 KB \(\~6.5 times less than -O0\) and it  
took around 0.62 seconds.  
Now, let's optimize it further using the -O3 option\:  
\$ time emcc -O3 --profiling optimization\_check.c  
emcc -O3 --profiling optimization\_check.c 1.03s user  
0.21s system 110% cpu 1.117 total  
Find out more about the --profiling flag at https\://emscripten.org/

Check the sizes of the file generated\:  
\$ l  
324B optimization\_check.c  
2.0K a.out.wasm  
17K a.out.js  
The WebAssembly file generated is the same size as -02 but the generated  
JavaScript file is 3 KB less, and it took around 1.117 seconds to compile.  
Now, let's optimize it further using the -Os option\:  
\$ time emcc -Os optimization\_check.c  
emcc -Os optimization\_check.c 1.03s user 0.22s system  
46% cpu 2.655 total 32 Understanding Emscripten  
Check the sizes of the file generated\:  
\$ l  
324B optimization\_check.c  
1.7K a.out.wasm  
14K a.out.js  
9\. The WebAssembly file generated is about 1.7 KB \(\~7.5 times less than -O0\) and it  
took almost 2.655 seconds.  
Now, let's optimize it further using the -Oz option\:  
\$ time emcc -Oz optimization\_check.c  
emcc -Oz optimization\_check.c 1.03s user 0.21s system  
110% cpu 1.123 total  
Check the sizes of the file generated\:  
\$ l  
324B optimization\_check.c  
1.7K a.out.wasm  
14K a.out.js  
The WebAssembly file generated is about 1.7 KB \(\~7.5 times less than -O0\) and it took  
around 1.123 seconds.  
Next, we'll see an alternative means provided by the Emscripten compiler for improving  
the efficiency and reducing the generated code size\: Closure Compiler  
# Closure Compiler  
Closure Compiler is a tool for compiling JavaScript to better JavaScript. It parses, analyzes,  
removes dead code, rewrites, and minimizes JavaScript. Further optimizations on the  
generated binding JavaScript file and WebAssembly module are done using Closure  
Compiler. With Closure Compiler, we can do better optimizations on Emscripten code.  
To optimize the WebAssembly module and JavaScript further, we can use --closure  
\<optimization type\>.  
The optimization type has the following options\:  
•  
•  
--closure 0 – This option adds no Closure Compiler optimizations.  
--closure 1 – This option reduces the generated JavaScript code size. This  
option does not optimize the asm.js and WebAssembly binary. This adds an  
additional compilation step that increases the compilation time. Understanding various levels of optimizations 33  
•  
--closure 2 – This option optimizes JavaScript, asm.js, and not the  
WebAssembly binary and reduces the code size of the file drastically for asm.js.  
We will use the –closure 1 option to optimize the WebAssembly binary along with  
the–O3/s Emscripten optimization options\:  
\$ time emcc -O3 --closure 1 optimization\_check.c  
emcc -O3 --closure 1 optimization\_check.c 2.40s user 0.42s  
system 105% cpu 2.681 total  
The file sizes generated are as follows\:  
\$ l  
324B optimization\_check.c  
1.8K a.out.wasm  
6.5K a.out.js  
Along with emcc –O3, we pass –closure 1 to further optimize the generated files.  
Closure Compiler reduces the size of the JavaScript file by 50% when compared to the  
emcc -O3 option and it took 2.681 seconds to compile\:  
time emcc -Os --closure 1 optimization\_check.c  
emcc -Os --closure 1 optimization\_check.c 2.53s user 0.42s  
system 106% cpu 2.778 total  
Let's list the files in the current folder to check the generated files and their size\:  
\$ l  
324B optimization\_check.c  
1.7K a.out.wasm  
6.5K a.out.js  
Along with emcc –Os, we pass –closure 1 to further optimize the generated binary.  
Closure Compiler reduces the .wasm file a little bit more with the emcc -Os option, and  
it took 2.778 seconds to compile.  
Note  
When optimizing for size, try to use both -O3 or -Os along with  
--closure 1 to optimize both JavaScript and the WebAssembly module. 34 Understanding Emscripten

# Summary  
In this chapter, we learned how to install and use Emscripten to compile C/C++  
into a WebAssembly module. We also explored the emsdk tool and various levels of  
optimizations when generating the WebAssembly module. In the next chapter, we will  
explore the WebAssembly module. 3  
# Exploring  
# WebAssembly  
# Modules  
WebAssembly is a low-level assembly-like code that is designed for efficient execution  
and compact representation. WebAssembly runs at a near-native speed in all JavaScript  
engines \(including modern desktop and mobile browsers and Node.js\). Compact  
representation of the binary enables the generated binary to be as small as possible in size.  
Note  
The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable high-performance applications.  
Each WebAssembly file is an efficient, optimal, and self-sufficient module called a  
WebAssembly module \(WASM\). WASM is safe, that is, the binary runs in a memory-safe  
and sandboxed environment. WASM does not have permission to access anything outside  
of that sandbox. WASM is language-, hardware-, and platform-independent. 36 Exploring WebAssembly Modules  
WebAssembly is a virtual instruction set architecture \(ISA\). The WebAssembly  
specifications define the following\:  
•  
Instruction set  
•  
•  
Binary encoding  
Validation  
•  
Execution semantics  
The WebAssembly specification also defines a textual representation of the  
WebAssembly binary.  
In this chapter, we will explore WASM and how a JavaScript engine executes WASM. We  
then explore the WebAssembly text format and why it is useful. Understanding WASM  
execution and the WebAssembly text format will enable us to easily understand the  
module and debug it in the JavaScript engine. We will cover the following main topics in  
this chapter\:  
•  
•  
Understanding how WebAssembly works  
Exploring the WebAssembly text format  
# Technical requirements  
You can find the code files present in this chapter on GitHub at https\://github.  
com/PacktPublishing/Practical-WebAssembly.  
# Understanding how WebAssembly works  
Let's first explore how JavaScript and WebAssembly are executed inside the  
JavaScript engine.  
# Understanding JavaScript execution inside the  
# JavaScript engine  
The JavaScript engine first fetches the complete JavaScript file \(note that the engine has to  
wait until the entire file is downloaded/loaded\). Understanding how WebAssembly works 37  
Note  
The bigger the JavaScript file, the longer it takes to load. It doesn't matter how  
fast your JavaScript engine is or how efficient your code is. If your JavaScript  
file is huge \(that is, greater than 170 KB\), then your application is going to be  
slow at loading time.  
Figure 3.1 – JavaScript execution inside the JavaScript engine  
Once loaded, the JavaScript is parsed into abstract syntax trees \(ASTs\). This phase is  
called parse. Since JavaScript is both an interpreted and compiled language, the JavaScript  
engine kickstarts the execution after parsing. The interpreter executes the code faster but it  
compiles the code every time. This phase is called interpret.  
The JavaScript engine has watchers \(called profilers in some browsers\). Watchers keep  
track of code execution. If a particular block of code is executed frequently, then the  
watcher marks it as hot code. The engine compiles the block of code using the just-in-  
time \(JIT\) compiler. The engine spends some time doing the compilation, say in the order  
of nanoseconds. The time spent here is worth it, because the next time the function is  
called, the execution happens much faster, because the compiled version is always faster  
than the interpreted one. This phase is called optimize.  
JavaScript engines add one \(or two\) more layers of optimization. The watchers continue  
watching the code execution. The watchers then name the code that is called more often  
very hot code. The engine optimizes this code further. This optimization takes a long time  
\(consider something like -O3-level optimization\). This phase produces highly optimized  
code that runs super fast. This code is much faster than the previously optimized code and  
the interpreted version. Obviously, the engine spends more time during this phase, say in  
the order of milliseconds. This is compensated by the code performance and frequency  
of execution. 38 Exploring WebAssembly Modules  
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language and all the optimizations the engine can do are  
based on the assumption of types. If the assumption breaks, then the code is interpreted  
and executed, and the optimized code gets removed rather than throwing a runtime  
exception. The JavaScript engine implements the necessary type checks and bails out the  
optimized code when the assumed type changes. But the time spent on the optimize phase  
is in vain.  
We can prevent these type-related issues by using something such as TypeScript.  
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. With TypeScript, we can prevent polymorphic code  
\(code that accepts different types\). In the JavaScript engine, monomorphic code \(code that  
accepts only one type\) always runs faster than its polymorphic counterpart.  
There is no use in having highly optimized monomorphic JavaScript code if the JavaScript  
files are huge in size. The JavaScript engine has to wait until the entire file is downloaded.  
With a poor connection, that takes forever to happen.  
Note  
It is important to split the JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks. Including  
the JavaScript asynchronously \(or in other words, lazy loading\) boosts the  
performance of your application. We need to strike a correct balance and know  
which JavaScript module/file to load, cache, and then revalidate. Larger file  
sizes \(payloads\) will degrade the performance of the application greatly.  
The final step is garbage collection, where all the live objects in the memory are removed.  
The garbage collection in the JavaScript engine works on the basis of reference. During  
the garbage collection cycle, the JavaScript engine starts from the root object \(something  
like global in Node.js\). It finds all the objects referenced from the root object and marks  
them as reachable objects. It marks the remaining objects as unreachable objects. Finally,  
it sweeps the unreachable objects. Since it is automatically done by the JavaScript engine,  
the garbage collection process is not efficient and it is much slower.  
# Understanding WebAssembly execution inside the  
# JavaScript engine  
WASM is in binary format and is already compiled and optimized. The JavaScript engine  
fetches the WASM. Then, it decodes the WASM and converts it into the module's internal  
representation \(that is, AST\). This phase is called decode. The decode phase is much faster  
than JavaScript's parse phase. Understanding how WebAssembly works 39  
Figure 3.2 – WebAssembly execution inside the JavaScript engine  
Next, the decoded WASM enters the compile phase. During this phase, the module  
is validated, and during the validation, the code is checked for certain conditions to  
guarantee the module is safe and does not have any harmful code. The functions,  
instruction sequences, and the usage of stacks are type-checked during the validation  
process. The validated code is then compiled to machine-executable code. Since the  
WASM is already compiled and optimized, this compile phase is faster. During this phase,  
the WASM is converted into machine code.  
The compiled code then enters the execute phase. In the execute phase, the module is  
instantiated and invoked. During the instantiation, the engine instantiates the state and  
the execution stack \(memory where it stores all the information related to the program\)  
and then executes the module.  
The other advantage of WebAssembly is that the module is ready to compile and  
instantiate right from the first byte. Thus, the JavaScript engine need not wait until  
the entire module is downloaded. This further increases WebAssembly's performance.  
WebAssembly is fast because its execution has fewer steps than JavaScript execution, so  
the binary is already optimized and compiled, and the binary can be streaming compiled.  
Note  
WASM does not always provide high performance. There are scenarios in  
which JavaScript performs better. So, it is necessary to understand that and  
think before using WebAssembly.

We have seen how WebAssembly works inside the browser; now, let's explore the  
WebAssembly text format. 40 Exploring WebAssembly Modules  
# Exploring the WebAssembly text format  
Machines understand a bunch of 1s and 0s. We optimize the binary to make it run  
faster and more efficiently. The more concise and optimal the instructions are, the more  
efficient and performant the machine will be. But for people, it is difficult to contextually  
analyze and understand a huge blob of 1s and 0s. That is the very reason why we started  
abstracting and creating high-level programming languages.  
In the WebAssembly world, we convert human-readable programming languages, such  
as Rust, Go, and C/C++, into binary code. These binaries are a bunch of instructions  
with opcodes and operands. These instructions make the machine highly efficient but  
contextually make it difficult for us to understand.  
Why should we worry about the readability of the binary generated? Because it helps us to  
understand the code, which helps while debugging the code.  
WebAssembly provides the WebAssembly text format, WAST or WAT. WAST is a  
human-readable format of the WebAssembly binary. The JavaScript engine \(both in the  
browser and Node.js\), when loading the WebAssembly file, can convert the binary into  
WebAssembly text format. This helps in understanding what is in the code and debugging.  
Text editors can show the binary in WebAssembly text format, which is much more  
readable than its binary counterpart.  
Basic WASM in binary format is as follows\:  
00 61 73 6d 01 00 00 00  
This translates to the following\:  
00 61 73 6d 01 00 00 00  
\\0 a s m 1 0 0 0 \(ascii value of the character\)  
| | |  
--------- version  
|  
Magic Header  
This basic module has a magic header \(\\0asm\) followed by the version of  
WebAssembly \(01\). Exploring the WebAssembly text format 41  
The textual format is written in an s-expression format. Every instruction/expression  
in s-expression syntax should live within a pair of parentheses, \(\). S-expressions are  
commonly used when defining a nested list or structured tree. Many research papers  
on tree-based data structures use this notation to showcase their code. The s-expression  
removes all the unnecessary ceremony from XML, providing a concise format.  
Note  
Does this expression \(defining everything within parentheses\) look familiar?  
Have you ever worked with LISP \(or the languages that are built inspired  
by LISP\)?  
Modules are the basic building blocks in WASM. A textual representation of basic WASM  
is as follows\:  
\(module \)  
WASM is made up of a header and zero or more sections. The header starts with a magic  
header and the version of WASM. Following the header, the WASM may have zero or  
more of the following sections\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Types  
Functions  
Tables  
Memories  
Globals  
Element  
Data  
Start function  
Exports  
Imports  
All these sections are optional in WASM. The structure of WASM looks as follows\:  
module \:\:= \{  
types vec\<funcType\>,  
funcs vec\<func\>,  
tables vec\<table\>, 42 Exploring WebAssembly Modules  
mems vec\<mem\>,  
globals vec\<global\>,  
elem vec\<elem\>,  
data vec\<data\>,  
start start,  
imports vec\<import\>,  
exports vec\<export\>  
\}  
Every section inside the WASM is a vector \(array\) that contains zero or more values of the  
respective types, except for start. We will explore the start section later in the book.  
For now, start holds an index that references a function in the funcs section.  
Every section in the WASM takes the following format\:  
\<section id\>\<u32 section size\>\<Actual content of the section\>  
The first byte refers to a unique section ID. Every section has a unique section ID. Next to  
the unique section ID is an unsigned 32-bit \(u32\) integer that defines the section's size in  
bytes. The remaining bytes are the section content.  
Note  
Since the section size is defined by a u32 integer, the maximum size of the  
section is limited to approximately 4.2 GB of memory \(that is, 2\^32 - 1\).  
In the WebAssembly text format, we use the name of the section to represent each  
segment in the section.  
For example, the function section contains a list of functions. A sample function  
definition in WebAssembly text format is as follows\:  
\(func \<name\>? \<func\_type\> \<local\>\* \<inst\>\* \)  
As with other expressions, everything that we define goes within parentheses, \(\). First, we  
define the function block with a func keyword. Following the func keyword, we add the  
name of the function. The function name is optional here because in binary, the function  
is identified by the index of the function block inside the function section. Exploring the WebAssembly text format 43  
The name is followed by func\_type. func\_type is referred to as type\_use in the  
spec. type\_use here refers to the type definition. func\_type holds all the input  
parameters \(along with their types\) and the return type of the function. So, for an add  
function, which takes two input operands and returns the result, func\_type will look  
like this\:  
\(param \$lhs i32\) \(param \$rhs i32\) \(result i32\)  
Note  
The type is either i32, i64, f32, or f64 \(32-bit and 64-bit integer or float\).  
The type information might change in the future, when WebAssembly adds  
support for more types.  
The param keyword denotes the defined expression holds a parameter. \$lhs is the  
variable name. Note that all variables defined in the WebAssembly text format will have  
\$ as a prefix. Following that, we have the type of the parameter, i32. Similarly, we have  
defined another expression for the second operand, \$rhs. Finally, the return type is  
mentioned as \(result i32\). The result keyword denotes that the expression is a  
return type, followed by the type, i32.  
Following func\_type, we define any local variables that we will use inside the function.  
Finally, we have a list of instructions/operations.  
Let's define an add function with the preceding code snippets as a reference\:  
\(func \$add \(param \$lhs i32\) \(param \$rhs i32\) \(result i32\)  
get\_local \$lhs  
get\_local \$rhs  
i32.add\)  
The entire block is wrapped inside the parentheses. The function block starts with a func  
keyword. Then, we have an optional name \(\$add\) for the function. The WebAssembly  
binary module will use the function index inside the function section to identify the  
function rather than a name. Then, we define the operand and return type.  
Note  
In binary format, the parameters and results are defined via the type section  
as that helps to optimize the generated functions. But in the text format, for  
brevity and ease of understanding, the type information will be shown in every  
function definition. 44 Exploring WebAssembly Modules  
Then, we have a list of instructions. The first instruction, get\_local, gets the local value  
of \(from the heap\) \$lhs. Then, we fetch the local value of \$rhs. After that, we add them  
both using the i32.add instruction. Finally, the closing parenthesis finishes things off.  
There is no separate return statement/expression. So, how does the function know what  
to return?  
As we have seen before, WebAssembly is a stack machine. When a function is called, it  
creates an empty stack for it. The function then uses this stack to push and pop data.  
So, when the get\_local instruction is executed, it pushes the value into the stack. After  
the two get\_local calls, the stack will have \$lhs and \$rhs in the stack. Finally, i32.  
add will pop two values from the stack, do the add operation, and push the element.  
When the function is ended, the top of the stack will be taken out and provided to the  
function caller.  
If we want to export this function to the outside world, then we can add an export block\:  
\(export \<export\_name\> \(func \<function\_reference\>\)\)  
The export block is defined inside \(\). The export block starts with an export  
keyword. The export keyword is followed by the name of the function. Following  
the name, we refer to the function. The function block consists of the following func  
keyword. Then, we have function\_reference, which refers to the name of the  
function defined/imported inside the module.  
In order to export the add function, we define the following\:  
\(export "add" \(func \$add\)\)  
"add" refers to the name with which the function is exported outside the module,  
followed by \(func \$add\), referring to the function.  
Both the function and export sections should be wrapped inside a module section, to  
make it valid WASM\:  
\(module  
\(func \$add \(param \$lhs i32\) \(param \$rhs i32\)  
\(result i32\)  
get\_local \$lhs  
get\_local \$rhs  
i32.add\)  
\(export "add" \(func \$add\)\)  
\) Exploring the WebAssembly text format 45  
The preceding is valid WASM. Imagine it as a tree structure with the module as its root  
and both the function and export as its children.  
We have seen how to create a simple function in WebAssembly text format. Now, let's  
define a complex function in WebAssembly text format.  
# Building a function in WebAssembly text format  
For this, we will use a recursive Fibonacci series generator. The Fibonacci function that we  
will be writing will be of the following format\:  
\# Sample code in C for reference  
int fib\(n\) \{  
if \(n \<= 1\)  
return 1;  
else  
return fib\(n-1\)+ fib\(n-2\);  
\}  
Let's first define the function signature for the given fib function using WebAssembly  
text format. The fib function, similar to its C counterpart, takes in a number parameter  
and returns a number. So, the function definition follows the same signature in the  
WebAssembly text format\:  
\(func \$fib \(param \$n i32\) \(result i32\)  
...  
\)  
We define the function inside parentheses, \(\). The function starts with a func keyword.  
Following the keyword, we add the function name, \$fib. Then, we add the parameter to  
the function; in our case, the function has only one parameter, n; we define it as \(param  
\$n i32\). Then, the function returns a number, \(result i32\).  
WebAssembly does not have in-memory to handle temporary variables. In order to have  
local values, we should push the value into the stack and then retrieve it. So, to check  
n\<=1, we have to first create a local variable and store 1 inside it, and then do the check.  
To define a local variable, we use the local block. The local block starts with a local  
keyword. This keyword is followed by the name of the variable. After the variable name,  
we define the type of the variable\:  
\(local \<name\> \<type\>\) 46 Exploring WebAssembly Modules  
Let's create a local variable called \$tmp\:  
\(local \$tmp i32\)  
Note  
\(local \$tmp i32\) is not an instruction. It is part of the function  
declaration. Remember, the preceding function syntax includes local.  
We then have to set the value of \$tmp to 1. To set the value, we first have to push the value  
1 into the stack, after which we have to pop the value from the stack and set it to \$tmp\:  
i32.const 1  
set\_local \$tmp  
i32.const creates an i32 constant value and pushes that into the stack. So, here, we  
create a constant with a value of 1 and push that into the stack.  
Then, we set the value in \$tmp using set\_local. set\_local takes the topmost value  
from the stack, in our case, 1, and assigns the value of \$tmp to 1.  
Now, we have to check whether the given parameter is less than 2. WebAssembly provides  
i32.\<some\_action\> to do some action on i32. For example, to add two numbers, we  
have used i32.add. Similarly, to check whether it's less than a particular value, we have  
i32.lt\_s. \_s here denotes that we are checking for a signed number.  
i32.lt\_s expects two operands. For the first operand \(that is, \$n\), we use the get\_  
local expression to fetch the value from \$n and put it at the top of the stack. Then, we  
create a constant of 2 using i32.const 2 and add 2 to the stack. Finally, we compare  
the \$n value with 2 using i32.lt\_s\:  
get\_local \$n  
i32.const 2  
i32.lt\_s  
But how do we define the if condition? WebAssembly provides br\_if and block.  
In WebAssembly text format, a block is defined with a block keyword followed by a  
name to identify the block. We end the block using end. The block looks as follows\:  
block \$block  
... ; some code goes in here.  
end Exploring the WebAssembly text format 47  
We will provide this block to br\_if. br\_if calls the block if the condition succeeds\:  
get\_local \$n  
i32.const 2  
i32.lt\_s  
br\_if \$block ; calls the \$block\` only when the condition  
succeeds.  
The WebAssembly text format so far will look like this\:  
\(module  
\(func \$fib \(param \$n i32\) \(result i32\) \(local \$tmp i32\)  
i32.const 1  
set\_local \$tmp  
; block  
block \$block  
; if condition  
get\_local \$n  
i32.const 2  
i32.lt\_s  
br\_if \$block  
... ; some code  
end  
; return value  
get\_local \$tmp  
\)  
\)  
Everything is wrapped inside module. At the end of \$block, the value will be stored in  
\$tmp. We get the value of \$tmp using get\_local \$tmp. The only thing that is left to  
do is to create the loop.  
Loop time  
First, we set \$tmp to 1\:  
i32.const 1  
set\_local \$tmp 48 Exploring WebAssembly Modules  
Then, we will create a loop. To create a loop, the WebAssembly text format uses the  
loop keyword\:  
loop \$loop  
end  
The loop keyword is followed by the name of the loop. The loop ends with the end  
keyword. loop is a special block that will run until we exit using some conditional  
expression such as br\_if\:  
get\_local \$n  
i32.const -2  
i32.add  
call \$fib  
get\_local \$tmp  
i32.add  
set\_local \$tmp  
get\_local \$n  
i32.const -1  
i32.add  
tee\_local \$n  
i32.const 1  
i32.gt\_s  
br\_if \$loop  
We get \$n and add -2 to it, and then call the fib function. To call a function, we use the  
call keyword followed by the name of the function. Here, call \$fib returns the value  
and pushes the value into the stack.  
Now, get \$tmp using get\_local \$tmp. This pushes \$tmp to the stack. Then, we use  
i32.add to pop two values from the stack and add them. Finally, we set \$tmp using  
set\_local \$tmp. set\_local \$tmp takes the topmost value from the stack and  
assigns it to \$tmp. We get \$n and add -1 to it.  
We use tee\_local here because tee\_local is similar to set\_local but instead of  
pushing the value into the stack, it returns the value. Finally, we run the loop until \$n is  
greater than 1. If it is less than 1, we break the loop using br\_if \$loop. The complete  
WebAssembly text format will look like this\:  
\(module  
\(func \(export \$fib \(param \$n i32\) \(result i32\) Exploring the WebAssembly text format 49  
\(local \$tmp i32\)  
i32.const 1  
set\_local \$tmp  
; block  
block \$block  
; if condition  
get\_local \$n  
i32.const 2  
i32.lt\_s  
br\_if \$block  
; loop  
loop \$loop  
get\_local \$n  
i32.const -2  
i32.add  
call \$fib  
get\_local \$tmp  
i32.add  
set\_local \$tmp  
get\_local \$n  
i32.const -1  
i32.add  
tee\_local \$n  
i32.const 1  
i32.gt\_s  
br\_if \$loop  
end  
end  
; return value  
get\_local \$tmp

# Summary  
In this chapter, we have seen how WebAssembly is executed inside the JavaScript  
engine and explored what WebAssembly text format is and how to define WASM  
using WebAssembly text format. In the next chapter, we will explore the WebAssembly  
Binary Toolkit. Section 2\:  
# WebAssembly Tools  
This section introduces the various tools available in WebAssembly and what we can  
achieve with them. It also explains various sections inside the WebAssembly module.  
You will understand how to generate WebAssembly from different sources and how to use  
various tools in the WebAssembly ecosystem after finishing this chapter.  
This section comprises the following chapters\:

# Understanding  
# WebAssembly  
# Binary Toolkit  
The Rust compiler chain converts Rust code into WebAssembly binary. But the generated  
binaries are both size- and performance-optimized. It is difficult to understand,  
debug, and validate binary code \(it is a bunch of hexadecimal numbers\). Converting  
WebAssembly binary back into the original source code is very difficult. WebAssembly  
Binary Toolkit \(WABT\) helps to convert WebAssembly binary into a human-readable  
format, such as the WebAssembly text \(WAST\) format or C-native code.  
Note  
Native code here does not refer to the original source of truth; instead, it refers  
to C-native code that the machine interprets.  
WebAssembly Binary Toolkit is abbreviated as WABT and pronounced as "wabbit." WABT  
provides a set of tools for converting, analyzing, and testing WebAssembly binaries. 54 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
In this chapter, we will explore WABT and how it helps to convert WebAssembly binary  
into various formats and why it is useful. We will cover the following main topics in this  
chapter\:

# Technical requirements  
You can find the code files present in this chapter on GitHub at https\://github.  
com/PacktPublishing/Practical-WebAssembly.  
# Getting started with WABT  
Let's first install WABT and then explore the various options provided by the WABT tool.  
# Installing WABT  
In order to install WABT, first clone the repository from GitHub\:  
\$ git clone --recursive https\://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt  
Note  
We use the --recursive flag here as it ensures that after the clone is  
created, all submodules within the repository \(such as test-suite\)  
are initialized.  
Go into the cloned repository, create a folder named build, and then go inside the  
build folder. This is where we will generate the binaries\:  
\$ cd wabt  
\$ mkdir build  
\$ cd build Getting started with WABT 55  
Note  
You will also need to install CMake. Refer to https\://cmake.org/  
download/ for more instructions.  
To build the binary with CMake, we first need to generate the build system. We specify the  
source to the cmake command. CMake will then build trees and generate a build system  
for the specified source, using the CMakeLists.txt file.  
Linux or macOS  
In order to generate the project build system, we run the cmake command with the path  
to the wabt folder. The cmake command accepts both a relative and absolute path. We  
are using the relative path here \(..\)\:  
\$ cmake ..  
Now we can build the project using cmake build. cmake build makes use of the  
generated project binary tree to generate the binaries\:  
Usage\: cmake --build \<dir\> \[options\] \[-- \[native-options\]\]  
Options\:  
\<dir\> = Project binary directory to be built.  
--parallel \[\<jobs\>\], -j \[\<jobs\>\]  
= Build in parallel using the given number of jobs.  
If \<jobs\> is omitted the native build  
tool's  
default number is used.  
The CMAKE\_BUILD\_PARALLEL\_LEVEL  
environment variable  
specifies a default parallel level when  
this option  
is not given.  
--target \<tgt\>..., -t \<tgt\>...  
= Build \<tgt\> instead of default targets.  
--config \<cfg\> = For multi-configuration tools, choose  
\<cfg\>.  
--clean-first = Build target 'clean' first, then build.  
\(To clean only, use --target 'clean'.\)  
--verbose, -v = Enable verbose output - if supported – 56 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
including the build commands to be executed.  
-- = Pass remaining options to the native  
tool.  
The cmake build command requires the \<dir\> option to generate the binaries. The  
cmake build command accepts the flags listed in the preceding code block\:  
\$ cmake --build .  
....  
\[100%\] Built target spectest-interp-copy-to-bin  
Windows  
Install CMake and Visual Studio \(\>= 2015\). Then, run cmake inside the build folder\:  
\$ cmake \[wabt project root\] -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=\[config\] –  
DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=\[install directory\] -G \[generator\]  
The \[config\] parameter can be either DEBUG or RELEASE.  
The \[install directory\] parameter should be the folder where you want to install  
the binaries.  
The \[generator\] parameter should be the type of project you want to generate, for  
example, Visual Studio 14 2015. You can see the list of available generators by running  
cmake –help.  
This will build and install all the required executables inside the folder specified\:  
\$ cd build  
\$ cmake --build .. --config RELEASE --target install  
Once you have successfully installed all the WABT tools, you can either add them to your  
path or call them from their path.  
The build folder contains the following binaries\:  
\$ tree -L 1

That sure is a huge list of binaries. Let's see what each one is capable of, in detail\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
wat2wasm – This tool helps to convert the WAST format into a WebAssembly  
module \(WASM\).  
wat-desugar – This tool reads a file in a WASM S-expression and formats it.  
wast2json – This tool validates and converts WAST format into JSON format.  
wasm2wat – This tool converts WASM into WAST format.  
wasm2c – This tool converts WASM into C-native code.  
wasm-validate – This tool validates whether the given WebAssembly is  
constructed as per the specification. 58 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
•  
wasm-strip – As we saw in the previous chapter, WASM consists of various  
sections. The custom section in the module is used only for extra meta-information  
about the module and the tools used in its generation. wasm-strip removes the  
custom section from the WASM.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
wasm-opcodecnt – This tool reads the WASM and counts the use of opcode  
instructions in the WebAssembly Module.  
wasm-objdump – This tool helps to print information about a WASM binary. It is  
similar to objdump \(https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objdump\) but for  
WebAssembly Modules.  
wasm-interp – This tool decodes and runs a WebAssembly binary file using a  
stack-based interpreter.  
wasm-decompile – This tool helps to decompile a WASM binary into readable  
C-like syntax.  
The following are the testing binaries\:

Note  
Explore various supported proposals by WABT at https\://github.  
com/WebAssembly/wabt\#supported-proposals.  
We have built WABT and generated the tools. Now, let's explore the most important and  
useful tools.  
# Converting WAST into WASM  
wat2wasm helps to convert the WAST format into WASM. Let's take it for a spin\:  
1\. Create a new folder called wabt-playground and go into the folder\:  
\$ mkdir wabt-playground  
\$ cd wabt-playground  
2\. Create a .wat file called add.wat\:  
\$ touch add.wat 3\. 4. 5. Converting WAST into WASM 59  
Add the following contents to add.wat\:  
\(module  
\(func \$add \(param \$lhs i32\) \(param \$rhs i32\) \(result i32\)  
get\_local \$lhs  
get\_local \$rhs  
i32.add  
\)  
\)  
Convert the WAST format into WASM using the wat2wasm binary\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wat2wasm add.wat  
This generates a valid WebAssembly binary in add.wasm file\:  
00 61 73 6d 01 00 00 00 01 07 01 60 02 7f 7f 017f 03  
02 01 00 0a 09 01 07 00 20 00 20 01 6a 0b  
Note that the size of the generated binary is 32 bytes.  
WABT reads the WAST format file \(.wat\) and converts it into a WebAssembly  
module \(.wasm\). wat2wasm first validates the given file \(.wat\) and then converts  
it into a .wasm file. To check the various options supported by wat2wasm, we can  
run the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wat2wasm --help  
usage\: wat2wasm \[options\] filename  
read a file in the wasm text format, check it for  
errors, and  
convert it to the wasm binary format.  
examples\:  
\# parse and typecheck test.wat  
\$ wat2wasm test.wat  
\# parse test.wat and write to binary file test.wasm  
\$ wat2wasm test.wat -o test.wasm  
\# parse spec-test.wast, and write verbose output to  
stdout \(including  
\# the meaning of every byte\)  
\$ wat2wasm spec-test.wast -v  
options\: 60 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
--help Print this help message  
--version Print version information  
-v, --verbose Use multiple times for more info  
--debug-parser Turn on debugging the parser  
of wat files  
...  
--debug-names Write debug names to the  
generated binary file  
--no-check Don't check for invalid  
modules  
6\. If we need to generate the WASM file in a different name, we can use the -o option  
with the filename. For example, wat2wasm add.wat -o add.wasm will  
generate add.wasm.  
wat2wasm also provides verbose output that clearly explains how the WASM is  
structured. In order to see the structure of the WASM, we run it with the -v option\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wat2wasm add.wat -v  
0000000\: 0061 736d ; WASM\_BINARY\_MAGIC  
0000004\: 0100 0000 ; WASM\_BINARY\_VERSION

0000018\: 07 ; FIXUP func body size  
0000016\: 09 ; FIXUP section size  
The preceding output is a detailed description of the binary generated. The leftmost  
seven numbers are the index, followed by a colon. The next two characters are the  
actual binary code, and then comments. The comment describes what the binary  
\(op\)code does.  
The first two lines specify wasm\_magic\_header and its version. The next  
segment is the Type section. The Type section defines the section ID, followed by  
the size of the section, and then the number of type blocks. In our case, we have  
only one type. The type 0 section defines the type signature of the add function.  
Then, we have the Function section. In the Function section, we have the  
section ID, followed by the section size, and then the number of functions. The  
function section does not have the function body. The function body is defined in  
the Code section.  
While generating the binary, we can enable the compiler to include the new and  
shiny features and disable various existing features using the appropriate enable-\*  
and disable-\* options, respectively.  
Note  
You can also check the online version at https\://webassembly.  
github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/ to explore the WABT tools. 62 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
We have converted WAST into WASM. Now, let's explore how to convert WASM into  
WAST with wasm2wat.  
# Converting WASM into WAST  
Sometimes, for debugging or understanding, we need to know what the WASM is doing.  
WABT has a wasm2wat converter. It helps to convert WASM into WAST format\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm2wat add.wasm  
\(module  
\(type \(;0;\) \(func \(param i32 i32\) \(result i32\)\)\)  
\(func \(;0;\) \(type 0\) \(param i32 i32\) \(result i32\)  
local.get 0  
local.get 1  
i32.add\)\)  
Running the previous command will convert add.wasm back into WAST format and  
print the output in the console.  
If you want to save it as a file, you can do so by using the -o flag\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm2wat add.wasm -o new\_  
add.wat  
This command creates a new\_add.wat file.  
To check the various options supported by wasm2wat, we can run the following  
command\:  
\$ wasm2wat --help  
usage\: wasm2wat \[options\] filename  
Read a file in the WebAssembly binary format, and convert  
it to  
the WebAssembly text format.  
examples\:  
\# parse binary file test.wasm and write text file test.wast  
\$ wasm2wat test.wasm -o test.wat Converting WASM into WAST 63  
\# parse test.wasm, write test.wat, but ignore the debug  
names, if any  
\$ wasm2wat test.wasm --no-debug-names -o test.wat  
options\:  
--help Print this help  
message  
--version Print version  
information  
-v, --verbose Use multiple times  
for more info  
-o, --output=FILENAME Output file for the  
generated wast file, by default use stdout  
-f, --fold-exprs Write folded  
expressions where possible  
....  
--no-debug-names Ignore debug names  
in the binary file  
--ignore-custom-section-errors Ignore errors in  
custom sections  
--generate-names Give auto-generated  
names to non-named functions, types, etc.  
--no-check Don't check for  
invalid modules  
Note  
Both wasm2wat and wat2wasm have almost identical options.  
Running the previous command with the -v option prints the AST syntax of the  
WAST format\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm2wat add.wasm -o new\_  
add.wat -v

OnLocalName\(func\_index\: 0, local\_index\: 1, name\: "rhs"\)  
EndNamesSection  
EndCustomSection  
EndModule  
The entire code block is wrapped inside BeginModule and EndModule.  
BeginModule includes the version of the WebAssembly binary.  
Inside the BeginModule, the BeginTypeSection starts with the section index of  
type \(that is, 7\), followed by OnTypeCount, the number of types defined. Then, we  
have the actual definition of the type with OnType. We end the type section with  
EndTypeSection. Converting WASM into WAST 65  
Then, we have the Function section marked by BeginFunctionSection and  
EndFunctionSection. This contains the function count \(OnFunctionCount\) and  
the function definition \(OnFunction\).  
Finally, we have the code section, which holds the actual body of the function. The code  
section begins and ends with BeginCodeSection and EndCodeSection.  
Sometimes, WASM may contain debug names. We can ignore them using the  
--no-debug-names flag\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm2wat add.wasm -o new\_  
add.wat -v --no-debug-names  
BeginModule\(version\: 1\)  
BeginTypeSection\(7\)

OnFunction\(index\: 0, sig\_index\: 0\)  
EndFunctionSection

EndCodeSection  
BeginCustomSection\('name', size\: 28\)  
EndCustomSection  
EndModule  
Note BeginCustomSection and EndCustomSection. Compare it with the previous  
output; it is missing NamesSection. Now, let's check out the various options provided  
by the wasm2wat tool. 66 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
# -f or --fold-exprs  
As a big fan of functional programming, this is one of the coolest options available. It folds  
over the expression; that is, it converts expression 1 \>\> expression 2 \>\> operation into  
operation \>\> expression 1 \>\> expression2.  
Let's see that in action\:  
1\. Create a WAST file called fold.wat and fill it with the following contents\:  
\(module  
\(func \$fold \(result i32\)  
i32.const 22  
i32.const 20  
i32.add  
\)  
\)  
2\. Let's first convert it into WASM using wat2wasm\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wat2wasm -v  
fold.wat  
; some contents  
0000018\: 41 ;  
i32.const  
0000019\: 16 ;  
i32 literal  
000001a\: 41 ;  
i32.const  
000001b\: 14 ;  
i32 literal  
000001c\: 6a ;  
i32.add  
; other contents  
3\. This creates fold.wasm.  
Now, convert the WASM into the WAST format using wasm2wat and pass in the  
-f option\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm2wat -v  
fold.wasm -o converted\_fold.wat -f Converting WASM into C 67  
This will create a file called converted\_fold.wat\:  
\(module  
\(type \(;0;\) \(func \(result i32\)\)\)  
\(func \(;0;\) \(type 0\) \(result i32\)  
\(i32.add  
\(i32.const 1\)  
\(i32.const 2\)\)\)\)  
Instead of using i32.const 1 \(expression 1\) and i32.const 2 \(expression  
2\) and then doing i32.add \(operation\), this generates an output, i32.add  
\(operation\), followed by i32.const 1 \(expression 1\) and i32.const 2  
\(expression 2\).  
While generating wat, we can enable the compiler to include the new and shiny features  
and disable various existing features using the appropriate enable-\* and disable-\*  
options, respectively.  
We have converted WASM into WAST. Now, let's explore how to convert WASM into  
native code \(C\) using wasm2c.  
# Converting WASM into C  
WABT has a wasm2c converter that converts WASM into C source code and a header.  
Let's create a simple.wat file\:  
\$ touch simple.wat  
Add the following contents to simple.wat\:  
\(module  
\(func \$uanswer \(result i32\)  
i32.const 22  
i32.const 20  
i32.add  
\)  
\) 68 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
wat here defines a uanswer function that adds 22 and 20 to give 42 as the answer. Let's  
create a WebAssembly binary using wat2wasm\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wat2wasm simple.wat -o  
simple.wasm  
This generates the simple.wasm binary. Now, convert the binary into C code using  
wasm2c\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm2c simple.wasm -o  
simple.c  
This generates simple.c and simple.h.  
Note  
Both simple.c and simple.h might look huge. Remember this is an  
autogenerated file and it includes all the necessary headers and configuration  
needed for the program to run.  
# simple.h  
simple.h \(the header file\) includes standard boilerplate for the header. It also includes  
the \_cplusplus condition to prevent name mangling in C++\:  
\#ifndef SIMPLE\_H\_GENERATED\_  
\#define SIMPLE\_H\_GENERATED\_  
\#ifdef \_\_cplusplus  
extern "C" \{  
\#endif  
...  
\#ifdef \_\_cplusplus  
\}  
\#endif  
\#endif  
Since we have used i32.const and i32.add, the header file also imports stdint.h.  
It includes wasm-rt.h. The wasm-rt.h header imports the necessary WASM runtime  
variables. Converting WASM into C 69  
Next, we can specify a module prefix. The module prefix is useful when using multiple  
modules. Since we only have one module, we use an empty prefix\:  
\#ifndef WASM\_RT\_MODULE\_PREFIX  
\#define WASM\_RT\_MODULE\_PREFIX  
\#endif  
\#define WASM\_RT\_PASTE\_\(x, y\) x \#\# y  
\#define WASM\_RT\_PASTE\(x, y\) WASM\_RT\_PASTE\_\(x, y\)  
\#define WASM\_RT\_ADD\_PREFIX\(x\) WASM\_RT\_PASTE\(WASM\_RT\_MODULE\_  
PREFIX, x\)  
Next, we have some typedefs for the various number formats that WASM supports\:  
typedef uint8\_t u8;  
typedef int8\_t s8;  
typedef uint16\_t u16;  
typedef int16\_t s16;  
typedef uint32\_t u32;  
typedef int32\_t s32;  
typedef uint64\_t u64;  
typedef int64\_t s64;  
typedef float f32;  
typedef double f64;  
# simple.c  
simple.c provides the actual C code generated from the WASM binary. The generated  
code has the following\:  
1\. We'll require the following list of libraries to use in the code\:  
\#include \<math.h\>  
\#include \<string.h\>  
\#include "simple.h" 70 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
2\. Next, we define the trap that is called when an error occurs\:  
\#define TRAP\(x\) \(wasm\_rt\_trap\(WASM\_RT\_TRAP\_\#\#x\), 0\)  
3\. Then, we define PROLOGUE, EPILOGUE, and UNREACHABLE\_TRAP, which are  
called before the start of execution, after execution, and when the execution meets  
an unreachable exception, respectively\:  
\#define FUNC\_PROLOGUE  
\\  
if \(++wasm\_rt\_call\_stack\_depth \>  
WASM\_RT\_MAX\_CALL\_STACK\_DEPTH\) \\  
TRAP\(EXHAUSTION\)  
\#define FUNC\_EPILOGUE --wasm\_rt\_call\_stack\_depth  
\#define UNREACHABLE TRAP\(UNREACHABLE\)  
4. WASM\_RT\_MAX\_CALL\_STACK\_DEPTH is the maximum depth of the stack. By  
default, the value is 500 but we can change it. Note that if it reaches the limit, then  
an exception is thrown.  
Next, we define the memory manipulations\:  
\#if WASM\_RT\_MEMCHECK\_SIGNAL\_HANDLER  
\#define MEMCHECK\(mem, a, t\)  
\#else  
\#define MEMCHECK\(mem, a, t\) \\  
if \(UNLIKELY\(\(a\) + sizeof\(t\) \> mem-\>size\)\) TRAP\(OOB\)  
\#endif  
\#define DEFINE\_LOAD\(name, t1, t2, t3\)  
\\  
static inline t3 name\(wasm\_rt\_memory\_t\* mem, u64  
addr\) \{ \\  
MEMCHECK\(mem, addr, t1\);  
\\  
t1 result;  
\\  
\_\_builtin\_memcpy\(&result, &mem-\>data\[addr\], 5\. 6. Converting WASM into C 71  
sizeof\(t1\)\); \\  
return \(t3\)\(t2\)result;  
\\  
\}  
\#define DEFINE\_STORE\(name, t1, t2\)  
\\  
static inline void name\(wasm\_rt\_memory\_t\* mem, u64  
addr, t2 value\) \{ \\  
MEMCHECK\(mem, addr, t1\);  
\\  
t1 wrapped = \(t1\)value;  
\\  
\_\_builtin\_memcpy\(&mem-\>data\[addr\], &wrapped,  
sizeof\(t1\)\); \\  
\}  
MEMCHECK checks for memory. The DEFINE\_LOAD and DEFINE\_STORE blocks  
define how to load and store a value in memory.  
Next, we define a bunch of load and store operations for various data types that we  
have in this example\:  
DEFINE\_LOAD\(i32\_load, u32, u32, u32\);  
DEFINE\_LOAD\(i64\_load, u64, u64, u64\);  
...  
DEFINE\_LOAD\(i64\_load32\_u, u32, u64, u64\);  
DEFINE\_STORE\(i32\_store, u32, u32\);  
DEFINE\_STORE\(i64\_store, u64, u64\);  
...  
DEFINE\_STORE\(i64\_store32, u32, u64\);  
Then, we define various functions that each of the data types supports, such as  
TRUNC, DIV, and REM.  
Next, we initialize the function types using func\_types\:  
static u32 func\_types\[1\];  
static void init\_func\_types\(void\) \{ 72 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
func\_types\[0\] = wasm\_rt\_register\_func\_type\(0, 1,  
WASM\_RT\_I32\);  
\}  
7\. This registers the \(result i32\) type in the WASM provided.  
Next, we initialize globals, memory, table, and exports\:  
static void init\_globals\(void\) \{  
\}  
static void init\_memory\(void\) \{  
\}  
static void init\_table\(void\) \{  
uint32\_t offset;  
\}  
static void init\_exports\(void\) \{  
\}  
8\. Now, we implement the actual function\:  
static u32 w2c\_f0\(void\) \{  
FUNC\_PROLOGUE;  
u32 w2c\_i0, w2c\_i1;  
w2c\_i0 = 22u;  
w2c\_i1 = 20u;  
w2c\_i0 += w2c\_i1;  
FUNC\_EPILOGUE;  
return w2c\_i0;  
\}  
The function is static. It calls FUNC\_PROLOGUE before the execution. Then, it  
creates two variables \(both are unsigned u32\). Then, we define the value of both the  
variables, 22 and 20, respectively. After that, we add them both. Once the execution  
is complete, we call FUNC\_EPILOGUE. Finally, we return the value.  
Note  
Since we have not exported anything in wat, init\_exports is empty. Converting WAST into JSON 73  
We have converted WASM into C. The generated code is slightly different from the  
original code. Let's explore how to convert WAST into JSON with wast2json.  
# Converting WAST into JSON  
The wast2json tool reads the WAST format and parses it, checks for errors, and then  
converts WAST into the JSON file. It generates a JSON and WASM file associated with the  
WAST file. Then, it links the WASM inside the JSON\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wast2json add.wat -o add.  
json  
\$ cat add.json  
\{"source\_filename"\: "add.wat",  
"commands"\: \[  
\{"type"\: "module", "line"\: 1, "filename"\: "add.0.wasm"\}\]\}  
To check the various options supported by wast2json, run the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wast2json --help  
usage\: wast2json \[options\] filename

These are the frequently used WABT tools. There are a few other tools provided by WABT  
that help with debugging and understanding WASM better.  
# Understanding a few other tools provided  
# by WABT  
In addition to the converters, WABT also provides a few tools that help us to understand  
WASM better. In this section, let's explore the following tools provided by WABT\:  
•  
•  
•  
wasm-objdump  
wasm-strip  
wasm-validate  
•  
wasm-interp  
# wasm-objdump  
Object code is nothing more than a sequence of instructions or statements in the  
computer language. Object code is what the compiler produces. The object code is then  
collected together and then stored inside the object file. The object file is the metadata  
holder for linking and debugging information. The machine code in the object file is not  
directly executable, but it provides valuable information when debugging and also helps  
with linking.  
Note  
objdump is the tool that is available in POSIX systems that provides a way to  
disassemble the binary format and print the assembly format of the code that  
is running.  
The wasm-objdump tool provides the following options\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm-objdump --help  
usage\: wasm-objdump \[options\] filename+  
Print information about the contents of wasm binaries.  
examples\:  
\$ wasm-objdump test.wasm 76 Understanding WebAssembly Binary Toolkit  
options\:  
--help Print this help message  
--version Print version information  
-h, --headers Print headers  
-j, --section=SECTION Select just one section  
-s, --full-contents Print raw section contents  
-d, --disassemble Disassemble function bodies  
--debug Print extra debug information  
-x, --details Show section details  
-r, --reloc Show relocations inline with  
disassembly  
At least one of the following options should be provided to the wasm-objdump  
command\:  
-d/--disassemble  
-h/--headers  
-x/--details  
-s/--full-contents  
The -h option prints all the available headers in WASM. For example, in our add example  
\(add.wasm\), we have the following\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm-objdump add.wasm -h  
add.wasm\: file format wasm 0x1  
Sections\:  
Type start=0x0000000a end=0x00000011 \(size=0x00000007\)  
count\: 1  
Function start=0x00000013 end=0x00000015 \(size=0x00000002\)  
count\: 1  
Code start=0x00000017 end=0x00000020 \(size=0x00000009\)  
count\: 1  
Here, we have three sections available\:  
•  
•  
Type  
Function Understanding a few other tools provided by WABT 77  
•  
Code  
The -d option prints the actual body of the function available\:  
\$/path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm-objdump add.wasm -d  
add.wasm\: file format wasm 0x1  
Code Disassembly\:  
000019 func\[0\]\:

00001c\: 20 01 | local.get 1  
00001e\: 6a | i32.add  
00001f\: 0b | end  
It dissembles the assembly function and prints only the function body.  
The -x option prints the section details of the WebAssembly binary file\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm-objdump add.wasm -x  
add.wasm\: file format wasm 0x1

0000017\: 0107 0020 0020 016a 0b ... . .j.  
# wasm-strip  
The custom section in a WASM holds information about the names of the function and  
all locals defined in the WASM. It may contain information about the build and how the  
WASM was created. This is additional information. It bloats the binary and does not add  
any functionality.  
We can strip the custom section to trim the binary size using the wasm-strip tool\:  
1\. Create a wat file with the following contents\:  
\$ touch simple.wat  
\(module  
\(func \$fold \(result i32\)  
i32.const 22  
i32.const 20  
i32.add  
\)  
\)  
2\. Now, convert that into a WASM with wat2wasm\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wat2wasm simple.wat  
--debug-names  
\$ l simple.wasm  
51B simple.wasm Understanding a few other tools provided by WABT 79  
Note  
The --debug-names option provided generates the custom section and  
adds it to the binary generated.  
3\. The previous command generates a simple.wasm file and it is 51 bytes in size.  
Now, let's remove the custom section from the binary using the following\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm-strip add.wasm  
\$ l simple.wasm  
30B simple.wasm  
As you can see, it removed 21 bytes of unnecessary information. Some WASM generators  
add the custom section for a better debugging experience but when deploying in  
production, we do not need the custom section. Use wasm-strip to remove it.  
# wasm-validate  
We can validate the WASM using wasm-validate\:  
1\. Create error.wasm with the following contents\:  
00 61 73 6d 03 00 00 00  
|  
Error value  
2\. Now, run wasm-validate to check whether the WASM is valid or not\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wasm-validate  
error.wasm  
0000004\: error\: bad magic value  
3\. The wasm-validate tool provides the following options\:  
usage\: wasm-validate \[options\] filename

WABT provides a list of tools that make WASM easier to understand, debug, and convert  
into various human-readable formats. It is one of the most important toolkits that allows  
developers to explore the WASM better.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we saw what WABT is and how to install and use various tools provided by  
it. The WABT tool is very important in the WebAssembly ecosystem as it provides an easy  
option to convert non-readable, compact binaries into readable, expanded source code.  
In the next chapter, we will explore various sections inside the WASM. 5  
# Understanding  
# Sections in  
# WebAssembly  
# Modules  
A WebAssembly module is composed of zero or more sections. Each section has its  
own functionality. In the previous chapters, we saw how functions are defined inside a  
WebAssembly module. A function is a section inside a WebAssembly module.  
In this chapter, we will explore the various other sections inside a WebAssembly module.  
Understanding the various sections inside a WebAssembly module will make it easier  
for us to identify, debug, and write efficient WebAssembly modules. We will cover the  
following sections in this chapter\:  
•  
•  
Exports and imports  
Globals  
•

•

# Technical requirements  
You can find the code files present in this chapter on GitHub at https\://github.  
com/PacktPublishing/Practical-WebAssembly/tree/main/05-wasm-  
sections.  
# Exports and imports  
A WebAssembly module consists of export and import sections. These sections are  
responsible for exporting functions out of and importing functions into the  
WebAssembly module.  
# Exports  
In order to call the functions defined in a WebAssembly module from JavaScript, we need  
to export the functions from the WebAssembly module. The export section is where we  
will define all the functions that are exported out of the WebAssembly module.  
Let's go back to our classic add.wat example from the previous chapter\:  
; add.wat  
\(module  
\(func \$add \(param \$lhs i32\) \(param \$rhs i32\)  
\(result i32\)  
get\_local \$lhs  
get\_local \$rhs  
i32.add\)  
\(export "add" \(func \$add\)\)  
\)  
Here, we have exported the add function using the \(export "add" \(func \$add\)\)  
statement. To export a function, we have used the export keyword followed by the name  
of the function and then the pointer to the exported function itself.  
Remember that WebAssembly is compact-sized. Thus, we can represent the export  
statement along with the function definition itself, like so\:  
; add.wat  
\(module  
\(func \$add \(export "add"\) \(param \$lhs i32\)  
\(param \$rhs i32\) \(result i32\) Exports and imports 85  
get\_local \$lhs  
get\_local \$rhs  
i32.add\)  
\)  
Let's use WABT's wat2wasm tool to convert the WebAssembly text format into a  
WebAssembly module with the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/wabt/bin/wat2wasm add.wat  
Let's analyze the generated byte code using the hexdump tool\:  
\$ hexdump add.wasm  
0000000 00 61 73 6d 01 00 00 00 01 07 01 60 02 7f 7f 01  
0000010 7f 03 02 01 00 07 07 01 03 61 64 64 00 00 0a 09  
0000020 01 07 00 20 00 20 01 6a 0b  
0000029  
As expected, the first byte consists of the magic header and version of the binary 00 61  
73 6d 01 00 00 00\:  
0000000\: 0061 736d ; WASM\_BINARY\_MAGIC  
0000004\: 0100 0000 ; WASM\_BINARY\_VERSION  
The next bit is 01, which represents the section index of the type section. Following that,  
we have the size of the type section, which is 07. The next seven bits are the type section.  
01 represents the number of type definitions available\:  
; section "Type" \(1\)  
0000008\: 01 ; section code  
0000009\: 07 ; section size  
000000a\: 01 ; num types  
Then, we have 60, which represents func. Following that, we have 02, representing the  
two parameters. 7f is the opcode for defining the i32 type. Since both the parameters are  
i32, we have consecutive 7f opcodes. Following that, the last two bits represent the return  
type and there is also 7f representing i32\:  
; type 0  
000000b\: 60 ; func  
000000c\: 02 ; num params 86 Understanding Sections in WebAssembly Modules  
000000d\: 7f ; i32  
000000e\: 7f ; i32  
000000f\: 01 ; num results  
0000010\: 7f ; i32  
After the type section, we have the func section. The unique identifier for the func  
section is 03. Following that, we have 02, which defines the size of the function section.  
That is the size of the function section is just 2 bits. But we defined the function definition  
for add in the WebAssembly text format and the function is more than 2 bits in size. So,  
how is it possible? The reason is that the function section does not have the  
body of the function; instead, it just defines the available functions. The functions are  
defined in the code section. The next 01 defines that there is only one function defined in  
the module\:  
; section "Function" \(3\)

0000012\: 02 ; section size

index  
Then, we have the export section, which starts with 07. The next 07 represents the size  
of the export section. Then, we define the number of exports exported in the export  
section. The next bit represents the length of the exported function name. The next 03 bits  
represent the function name, add. Then, the export section has the kind of export and  
function index of the exported function\:  
; section "Export" \(7\)  
0000015\: 07 ; section code

000001c\: 00 ; export kind  
000001d\: 00 ; export func index  
The last segment starts with 0a. 0a is a unique identifier for the code section. The code  
section is of length 09. Next, 01 represents the number of functions defined in  
the code block. Exports and imports 87  
Next, 07 represents the length of the function definition. The next seven bits actually  
define the function block. 00 indicates that the function block does not have any local  
declarations. 20 is the opcode for get\_local and we take the 00 index, and then again  
we have 20 opcode to get\_local and we take the 01 index. Then, we add them using  
i32.add. The opcode for the i32 addition is 6a. Finally, we use 0b to end the function  
code block\:  
; section "Code" \(10\)  
000001e\: 0a ; section code

0000027\: 6a ; i32.add  
0000028\: 0b ; end  
We have seen how the export section is represented in a WebAssembly module. In the  
next section, let's see how the import section is represented in a WebAssembly module.  
# Imports  
In order to import a function from another WebAssembly module or JavaScript module,  
we need to import the functions in the WebAssembly module. The import section is  
where we will import all the external dependencies into the WebAssembly module.  
Now, let's imagine that a JavaScript module exports a function named jsAdd. We can  
import the jsAdd function using the import keyword. Create a file called jsAdd.wat  
and add the following content to it\:  
\(module  
\(func \$i \(import "imports" "jsAdd"\) \(param i32\)\)  
\) 88 Understanding Sections in WebAssembly Modules  
Here, we are defining a function with the func keyword, followed by the name of the  
function, \$i. We use \$i to call the function inside the WebAssembly module. Then, we  
have the import keyword. The import keyword is followed by the module name. The  
module name here refers to the JavaScript module, and then we have the name of the  
function to import from the JavaScript module.  
Finally, we have param. Since a WebAssembly module is typed, we have to define the  
input parameters and return types in the function definition.  
Let's use WABT's wat2wasm to convert the WebAssembly text format into a  
WebAssembly module with the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/wabt/bin/wat2wasm jsAdd.wat  
Let's analyze the generated byte code using the hexdump tool\:  
\$ hexdump jsAdd.wasm  
0000000 00 61 73 6d 01 00 00 00 01 05 01 60 01 7f 00 02  
0000010 11 01 07 69 6d 70 6f 72 74 73 05 6a 73 41 64 64  
0000020 00 00  
0000022  
The binary consists of the import section, which starts at the index of 16. The import  
section starts with 02 because the unique section index of the import section is 02. After  
that, we have 11, which represents the size of the import section in the binary. The next  
bit represents the number of imports, 01.  
Then, we have the definition for the import. 07 here represents the length of the imported  
function. The next seven bits represent the name of the import module. The next bit  
represents the length of the function name, 05, and the next five bits represent the  
function name. Finally, we have the kind and type signature of the index\:  
; Other information  
; section "Import" \(2\)  
000000f\: 02 ; section code  
0000010\: 11 ; section size

0000020\: 00 ; import kind  
0000021\: 00 ; import signature  
index  
Now, you can call the jsAdd function like you would other functions inside a  
WebAssembly module using the \$i identifier.  
We have explored how both the import and export sections are defined inside a  
WebAssembly module and how they help to import and export a function. Now, let's  
explore how to import and export values in and out of a WebAssembly module.  
# Globals  
The globals section is where we can import and export values in and out of WebAssembly  
modules. In a WebAssembly module, you can import either mutable or immutable values  
from JavaScript. Additionally, WebAssembly also supports wasmValue, an internal  
immutable value inside the WebAssembly module itself.  
Let's create a file called globals.wat and add the following contents to it\:  
\$ touch globals.wat  
\(module  
\(global \$mutableValue \(import "js" "mutableGlobal"\)  
\(mut i32\)\)  
\(global \$immutableValue \(import "js"  
"immutableGlobal"\) i32\)  
\(global \$wasmValue i32 \(i32.const 10\)\)  
\(func \(export "getWasmValue"\) \(result i32\)  
\(global.get \$wasmValue\)\)  
\(func \(export "getMutableValue"\) \(result i32\)  
\(global.get \$mutableValue\)\)  
\(func \(export "getImmutableValue"\) \(result i32\)  
\(global.get \$immutableValue\)\)  
\(func \(export "setMutableValue"\) \(param \$v i32\)  
\(global.set \$mutableValue  
\(local.get \$v\)\)\)  
\) 90 Understanding Sections in WebAssembly Modules  
We created a module \(module\) and three global variables\:  
•  
•  
•  
\$mutableValue – This value is imported from the js JavaScript module  
and the mutableGlobal variable. We also define the global variable to be of the  
mut i32 type.  
\$immutableValue – This value is imported from the js JavaScript module  
and the immutableGlobal variable. We also define the global variable to be of  
the i32 type.  
\$wasmValue – This is a global constant. We define the global keyword followed  
by the name of the global variable, \$wasmValue, then the type of i32, and finally  
the actual value \(i32.const 10\).  
Note  
\$wasmValue is immutable and cannot be exported to the external world.  
Then, we have a set of functions that helps to get and set the global variables.  
getWasmValue, getImmutableValue, and getMutableValue get the values  
of the wasmValue global constant, the immutableValue global constant, and the  
mutableValue global variable, respectively.  
Finally, a function that sets mutableValue to a new value is setMutableValue.  
setMutableValue takes in param \$v, which sets the value to \$mutableValue.  
Let's use WABT to convert the WebAssembly text format into a WebAssembly module  
with the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/wabt/bin/wat2wasm globals.wat  
Create a globals.html with the following content\:  
// globals.html  
\<html\>  
\<head\> \</head\>  
\<body\>  
\<script\>  
async function run\(\) \{ \}  
run\(\)  
\</script\>  
\</body\>  
\</html\> Globals 91  
Let's define the run function inside \<script\>.  
A WebAssembly.Global object represents a global variable instance, accessible from  
JavaScript and importable/exportable across one or more WebAssembly.Module  
instances. The WebAssembly.Global constructor expects a descriptor and value. The  
descriptor defines the type and mutability of the global variable defined\:  
Note  
This global variable constructor provides an option to dynamically link  
multiple WebAssembly modules.  
let immutableGlobal = new WebAssembly.Global\(\{value\:'i32',  
mutable\:false\}, 1000\)  
let mutableGlobal = new WebAssembly.Global\(\{value\:'i32',  
mutable\:true\}, 0\)  
We create two global values using the WebAssembly.Global constructor. They  
are immutableGlobal and mutableGlobal. The former is mutable\:false,  
while the latter is mutable\:true. So, we can change the value of the latter using  
mutableGlobal.value but not the former. If we try changing the value of  
immutableGlobal, then we will receive an error\:  
mutableGlobal.value = 1337 // valid.  
immutableGlobal.value = 7331 // Error  
After that, we fetch the globals.wasm WebAssembly module. Then, we instantiate  
arrayBuffer with the response and arrayBuffer with the WebAssembly.  
instantiate constructor. In addition to this, the WebAssembly.instantiate  
constructor accepts importsObject. We can send the JavaScript module via  
importsObject\:  
const response = await fetch\('./globals.wasm'\)  
const bytes = await response.arrayBuffer\(\)  
const wasm = await WebAssembly.instantiate\(bytes, \{ js\: \{  
mutableGlobal, immutableGlobal \} \}\) 92 Understanding Sections in WebAssembly Modules  
In this case, we are sending in the js module along with the mutableGlobal and  
immutableGlobal values. The wasm variable now holds the WebAssembly module.  
We invoke wasm.instance.exports to get all the exported functions from the  
WebAssembly module\:  
const \{  
getWasmValue,  
getMutableValue,  
setMutableValue,  
getImmutableValue  
\} = wasm.instance.exports  
getWasmValue, getMutableValue, setMutableValue, and  
getImmutableValue are the functions exported from the WebAssembly module.  
The getWasmValue function returns the value of the wasmValue inside the  
WebAssembly module\:  
console.log\(getWasmValue\(\)\) // 10  
The getMutableValue and setMutableValue functions return and set the  
mutableGlobal field defined in JavaScript and passed into the WebAssembly module\:  
console.log\(getMutableValue\(\)\) // 1337  
setMutableValue\(1338\)  
console.log\(getMutableValue\(\)\) // 1338  
Finally, we get the immutable value using the getImmutableValue function\:  
console.log\(getImmutableValue\(\)\) // 1000  
Let's run an example in the browser using the following command\:  
\$ python -m http.server  
Now, launch the URL http\://localhost\:8000/globals.html and open the  
developer tools.  
The WebAssembly binary contains an import section. The import section has a unique  
identifier, 02, followed by the size of the section, which is 2b \(which is 43 in decimal\). The  
next 43 bits represent the import section. Globals 93  
02 at the 000015 index represents the number of imports. Then, we have two sections  
that define the imported global functions\:  
; section "Import" \(2\)  
0000013\: 02 ; section code  
0000014\: 2b ; section size  
0000015\: 02 ; num imports  
Each global segment consists of the module string length and the module name, followed  
by the function string length and the function name. Finally, it has the kind of import, the  
type, and the mutability of the variable\:  
; import header 0  
0000016\: 02 ; string length  
0000017\: 6a73 js ; import module name  
0000019\: 0d ; string length

000003d\: 03 ; import kind  
000003e\: 7f ; i32  
000003f\: 00 ; global mutability 94 Understanding Sections in WebAssembly Modules  
After that, we have the Global section. The Global section has the unique section ID of  
6. The next bit defines the size of the Global section, which is 06.  
After that, we have the number of globals available. The number of globals is 01. This is  
because the other two globals are imported. The type, mutability, and value are the next  
4 bytes\:  
; section "Global" \(6\)  
0000047\: 06 ; section code  
0000048\: 06 ; section size  
0000049\: 01 ; num globals  
000004a\: 7f ; i32  
000004b\: 00 ; global mutability  
000004c\: 41 ; i32.const  
000004d\: 0a ; i32 literal  
000004e\: 0b ; end  
The first function body inside the code section looks as follows\:  
; function body 0  
000009c\: 04 ; func body size  
000009d\: 00 ; local decl count  
000009e\: 23 ; global.get  
000009f\: 02 ; global index  
00000a0\: 0b ; end  
function is four bits in length. The first 00 says that the function has no local  
declaration. The next 23 is the opcode for getting the global value. The next 02 defines the  
index of the global value. Even though the preceding global section specifies there is only  
one global value, the entire module takes the imported globals into account. Since there  
are two imported global values, we index the local global values after the imported global  
value. So, the \$wasmValue global has an index of 3. Finally, we end the function code  
with the 0b opcode. Similarly, the second and third function bodies define how we get the  
other two imported global values\:  
; function body 3  
00000ab\: 06 ; func body size  
00000ac\: 00 ; local decl count  
00000ad\: 20 ; local.get  
00000ae\: 00 ; local index Start 95  
00000af\: 24 ; global.set  
00000b0\: 00 ; global index  
00000b1\: 0b ; end  
In function body 4, we set the global value using global.set, which has an opcode of  
24.  
We have explored how to import and export values in and out of WebAssembly modules.  
Now, let's explore the special start function in the WebAssembly module.  
# Start  
Start is a special function that runs after the WebAssembly module is initialized. Let's  
take the same example that we used for the globals. We add the following content to  
globals.wat\:  
\(module  
; Code is elided  
\(func \$initMutableValue  
\(global.set \$mutableValue  
\(i32.const 200\)\)\)  
\(start \$initMutableValue\)  
\)  
We define the initMutableValue function, which sets mutableValue to 200. After  
that, we add a start block, which starts with startkeyword followed by the name of the  
function.  
Note  
The function referenced at the start should not return any value.  
Let's use WABT to convert the WebAssembly text format into a WebAssembly module  
with the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/wabt/bin/wat2wasm globals.wat  
Let's run the example in a browser using the following command\:  
\$ python -m http.server 96 Understanding Sections in WebAssembly Modules  
Now, launch the URL http\://localhost\:8000/globals.html and open the  
developer tools.  
The start function is similar to other functions, except that it is not classified into any type.  
The types may or may not be initialized at the time of the function. The start section of a  
WebAssembly module points to a function index \(the index of the location of the function  
section inside the function component\).  
The section ID of the start function is 8. When decoded, the start function represents the  
start component of the module\:  
; section "Start" \(8\)  
0000085\: 08 ; section code  
0000086\: 01 ; section size  
0000087\: 03 ; start func index  
Note  
At this moment, tools such as webpack do not support the start function.  
The start section is rewritten into a normal function and then the function is  
invoked when the JavaScript is initialized by the bundler itself.  
start is an interesting and useful function that enables setting up some values when  
the module is initialized to prevent unnecessary side effects that the module might cause.  
Now, let's explore the memory section. The memory section is responsible for transferring  
memory between JavaScript and WebAssembly.  
# Memory  
Transferring data between JavaScript and WebAssembly is an expensive operation. In  
order to reduce the transfer of data between JavaScript and WebAssembly modules,  
WebAssembly uses sharedArrayBuffer. With sharedArrayBuffer both the  
JavaScript and WebAssembly modules can access the same memory and use it to share the  
data from one to the other. Memory 97  
The memory section of a WebAssembly module is a vector of linear memories. The linear  
memory model is a memory addressing technique in which the memory is organized in  
a single contiguous address space. It is also known as a flat memory model. The linear  
memory model makes it easier to understand, program, and represent the memory. But  
the linear memory model comes with a huge disadvantage of high execution time for  
rearranging elements in the memory and the wastage of memory space. Here, the memory  
represents a vector of raw bytes of uninterpreted data. They use resizable array buffers  
to hold the raw bytes of memory. We use sharedArrayBuffers for defining and  
maintaining this memory.  
Note  
It is important to note that this memory is accessible and mutable by JavaScript  
and WebAssembly.  
We allocate the memory using the WebAssembly.Memory\(\) constructor. The  
constructor can accept an argument that defines the initial and maximum value of  
memory, like so\:  
\$ touch memory.html  
\$ vi memory.html  
let memory = new WebAssembly.Memory\(\{initial\: 10, maximum\:  
100\}\)  
Here, we define that WebAssembly.Memory has an initial memory of 10 and a  
maximum memory of 100. Then, we instantiate the WebAssembly module with the  
following code\:  
const response = await fetch\('./memory.wasm'\)  
const bytes = await response.arrayBuffer\(\)  
const wasm = await WebAssembly.instantiate\(bytes, \{ js\: \{  
memory \} \}\)  
Similar to the global example, here we are passing importObject, which takes in the js  
module and the memory object.  
Let's create a new file called memory.wat and add the following content to it\:  
\(module  
\(memory \(import "js" "memory"\) 1\)  
\(func \(export "sum"\) \(param \$ptr i32\) \(param \$len i32\)  
\(result i32\) 98 Understanding Sections in WebAssembly Modules  
\(local \$end i32\)  
\(local \$sum i32\)  
\(local.set \$end \(i32.add \(local.get \$ptr\)  
\(i32.mul \(local.get \$len\) \(i32.const 4\)\)\)\)  
\(block \$break \(loop \$top  
\(br\_if \$break \(i32.eq \(local.get \$ptr\)  
\(local.get \$end\)\)\)  
\(local.set \$sum \(i32.add \(local.get \$sum\)  
\(i32.load \(local.get \$ptr\)\)\)\)  
\(local.set \$ptr \(i32.add \(local.get \$ptr\)  
\(i32.const 4\)\)\)  
\(br \$top\)  
\)\)  
\(local.get \$sum\)  
\)  
\)  
Inside the module, we import the memory from the js module with the name memory.  
After that, we define a function sum and export the function outside the module. The  
function accepts two parameters as arguments and returns an i32 as an output. The first  
parameter is named \$ptr. It is a pointer to the index of where the value is present in  
sharedArrayBuffer. The next argument is \$len, which defines the length of the  
shared memory.  
Then, we create two local variables, \$end and \$sum. First, we set \$end to the value of  
\$ptr plus four times the value of \$len. Then, we create a block and start a loop. The loop  
ends when the value of \$end is equal to the value of \$ptr. We then set the value of \$sum  
by adding the existing value of \$sum with the value of \$ptr. Then, we increment \$ptr to  
the next value. Finally, we exit the loop and return \$sum. Memory 99  
The previous code is analogous to the following in JavaScript\:  
function sum\(ptr, len\) \{  
let end = ptr + \(len \* 4\)  
let tmp = 0  
while \(ptr \< end\) \{  
tmp = memory\[ptr\]  
ptr = ptr + 4  
\}  
return tmp;  
\}  
Let's go back to memory.html and initialize the buffer\:  
let i32Arr = new Uint32Array\(memory.buffer\)  
for \(var i = 0; i \< 50; i++\) \{  
i32Arr\[i\] = i \* i \* i  
\}  
We create an unsigned array using Uint32Array using the memory object we created.  
Then, we populate the array buffer with the cube of numbers from 1 to 50\:  
var sum = wasm.instance.exports.sum\(0, 50\)  
console.log\(sum\) // 1500625  
Finally, we call the sum inside the WebAssembly module and ask it to provide the sum of  
all the cubic numbers in the shared array buffer starting at 0 up to the length of 50.  
Let's use WABT to convert the WebAssembly text format into a WebAssembly module  
with the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/wabt/bin/wat2wasm memory.wat  
Let's run an example in the browser using the following command\:  
\$ python -m http.server 100 Understanding Sections in WebAssembly Modules  
Now, launch the URL http\://localhost\:8000/globals.html and open the  
developer tools.  
Memory sections are very useful when we have to transfer a large amount of data between  
two worlds. The memory sections make it easier to define, share, and access memory  
between the WebAssembly and JavaScript world.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we learned about the import, export, start, and memory sections  
in a WebAssembly module. We saw how they are structured and defined inside a  
WebAssembly module. Each of these sections carries one specific function and it is  
essential to understand, analyze, and debug the WebAssembly modules. In the next  
chapter, we will explore Binaryen. 6  
# Installing and  
# Using Binaryen  
During the compilation process, compiled languages produce their own Intermediate  
Representation \(IR\). The compilers then optimize the IR to generate optimized code.  
Before passing it to LLVM, compilers should convert this IR into something that LLVM  
understands \(LLVM IR\). LLVM optimizes LLVM IR and produces native code \(like the  
WebAssembly binary\). These multiple IR generations and optimizations at different levels  
make the compilation process slower and not very effective. Binaryen tries to eliminate  
these multiple IR generations and uses its own IR.  
\(WebAssembly\) Binary + Emscripten = Binaryen  
Binaryen is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for  
WebAssembly, written in C++. It aims to make compiling to WebAssembly  
easy, fast, and effective.  
- Binaryen's GitHub repository \(https\://github.com/  
WebAssembly/binaryen\)  
Binaryen uses its own version of IR. Binaryen's IR is a subset of WebAssembly. Thus,  
it makes compiling Binaryen to WebAssembly faster and easier. Binaryen's IR uses a  
compact data structure and is designed with modern CPU architecture in mind. That is,  
the WebAssembly binary can be generated and optimized in parallel using all the available  
CPU cores. 102 Installing and Using Binaryen  
In addition to that, Binaryen's optimizer has many passes that can improve the code  
significantly. Binaryen's optimizer uses techniques such as local coloring to coalesce  
local variables, dead code elimination, and precomputing expressions wherever possible.  
Binaryen also provides a way to shrink the WebAssembly binary.  
Binaryen is easy to use. It accepts the WebAssembly binary or even the control graph to  
generate a highly optimized WebAssembly binary. Binaryen also provides Binaryen.js,  
which enables the use of Binaryen from JavaScript. Similar to WABT, Binaryen includes a  
different set of tools that are useful while dealing with WebAssembly.  
These toolchain utilities help in parsing the WebAssembly binary and then optimizing it  
further, and finally, emit a highly optimized WebAssembly binary \(in other words, wasm-  
to-wasm optimizer\), providing a polyfill for WebAssembly when the browser does not  
have WebAssembly support.  
In this chapter, we will understand how to install and use various tools provided by  
Binaryen. Understanding Binaryen and the tools provided by it will help you to optimize  
the WebAssembly binaries in terms of performance and size. We will cover the following  
sections in this chapter\:

# Technical requirements  
We'll be requiring Binaryen and Visual C++ installed. You can find the code files  
present in this chapter on GitHub at https\://github.com/PacktPublishing/  
Practical-WebAssembly.  
# Installing and using Binaryen  
In order to install Binaryen, first clone the repository from GitHub\:  
\$ git clone https\://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen  
After the repository is cloned, go into the folder\:  
\$ cd binaryen Installing and using Binaryen 103  
# Linux/macOS  
Generate the project build system by running the cmake command with the path to the  
binaryen folder\:  
\$ cmake .  
Next, build the project using the make command\:  
\$ make .  
This generates all the binaries in the bin folder.  
# Windows  
For Windows, once the repository is cloned, we will create a build directory and go  
inside it\:  
\$ mkdir build  
\$ cd build  
By default, Windows does not have the cmake command available. Install the Visual  
C++ tools to make the cmake command available in the system. To install the Visual  
C++ tools, check out the following link\: https\://docs.microsoft.com/  
en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-  
160&viewFallbackFrom=vs-2019. Then, run the following command inside the  
build folder\:  
\$ "\<path-to-visual-studio-root\>\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\  
Microsoft\\CMake\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe" ..  
The preceding command will generate all the necessary build files in the build directory.  
Then, we can build the project using the binaryen.vcxproj file generated by cmake\:  
\$ msbuild binaryen.vcxproj  
The generated binary includes the following\:  
\$ tree -L 1

The various tools generated by Binaryen are as follows\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
wasm-as – This tool is similar to wat2wasm in WABT. This tool converts  
WebAssembly text format \(.wast\) into WebAssembly binary format \(.wasm\).  
wasm-ctor-eval – This tool executes C++ global constructors ahead of time and  
has them ready. This optimization speeds up the WebAssembly execution.  
wasm-dis – This tool is similar to wasm2wat in wabt. That is, it converts  
WebAssembly binary format \(.wasm\) into WebAssembly text format \(.wat\).  
wasm-emscripten-finalize – This tool performs Emscripten-specific  
transforms on the given .wasm files.  
wasm-metadce – This tool removes dead code in the provided WebAssembly  
binary.  
wasm-opt – This tool optimizes the provided WebAssembly binary.  
wasm-reduce – This tool reduces the given WebAssembly binary into a smaller  
binary.  
wasm-shell – This tool creates a shell that can load and interpret WebAssembly  
code.  
wasm2js – This tool is useful in polyfill. It converts WebAssembly into a JavaScript  
compiler.  
binaryen.js – A standalone JavaScript library that exposes Binaryen methods  
for creating and optimizing the WebAssembly modules. This JavaScript file is just  
like any other JavaScript file that can be loaded into the browser.  
Now that we have built and generated the tools provided by Binaryen, let's explore the  
tools generated. wasm-as 105  
# wasm-as  
The wasm-as tool converts WAST into WASM. Let's look at the steps\:  
1\. Let's create a new folder, called binaryen-playground, and go into the folder\:  
\$ mkdir binaryen-playground  
\$ cd binaryen-playground  
2\. Create a .wat file called add.wat\:  
\$ touch add.wat  
3\. Add the following contents to add.wat\:  
\(module  
\(func \$add \(param \$x i32\) \(param \$y i32\)  
\(result i32\)  
\(i32.add  
\(local.get \$x\)  
\(local.get \$y\)  
\)  
\)  
\)  
4\. Convert the Web Assembly text format into a WebAssembly module, using the  
wasm-as binary\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/binaryen/wasm-as add.wat  
This generates the add.wasm file\:  
00 61 73 6d 01 00 00 00 01 07 01 60 02 7f 7f 01  
7f 03 02 01 00 0a 09 01 07 00 20 00 20 01 6a 0b  
Note  
The size of the binary generated is just 32 bytes. 106 Installing and Using Binaryen  
wasm-as first validates the given file \(.wat\) and then converts it into a .wasm file. To  
check various options supported by wasm-as, we can run the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/binaryen/wasm-as --help  
wasm-as INFILE  
Assemble a .wat \(WebAssembly text format\) into a .wasm  
\(WebAssembly binary  
format\)  
Options\:  
--version Output version information  
and exit  
--help,-h Show this help message and  
exit  
--debug,-d Print debug information to  
stderr  
....  
--output,-o Output file \(stdout if not  
specified\)  
--validate,-v Control validation of the  
output module  
--debuginfo,-g Emit names section and debug  
info  
--source-map,-sm Emit source map to the  
specified file  
--source-map-url,-su Use specified string as  
source map URL  
--symbolmap,-s Emit a symbol map \(indexes  
=\> names\)  
If we need to generate the WebAssembly module file in a different name, we will use the  
-o option with the filename. For example, wasm-as add.wat -o customAdd.wasm  
will generate customAdd.wasm.  
wasm-as also provides verbose output that clearly explains how the WebAssembly  
module is structured. In order to see the structure of the WebAssembly module, we run it  
with the -d option\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/binaryen/wasm-as add.wat -d  
Loading 'add.wat'... wasm-dis 107  
s-parsing...  
w-parsing...

== writeHeader  
...  
== writeTypes  
...  
== writeFunctionSignatures  
...  
== writeFunctions  
...  
finishUp  
Done.  
The previous output is a detailed description of how the binary is generated. First, it loads  
the given .wat file. After that, it parses and validates the file. Finally, it creates add.wasm  
and writes the header, the type, function signatures, and functions. While generating  
the binary, we can enable the compiler to include the new and shiny features and disable  
various existing features using the appropriate enable-\* and disable-\* options.  
Additionally, you can generate sourcemap using the --sm option.  
Now that we have seen how to convert WAST to WASM, let's see how to convert WASM  
to WAST.  
# wasm-dis  
The wasm-dis tool converts WAST into WASM. We will use the add.wasm file that we  
created in the previous example here. Let's look at the steps\:  
1\. In order to convert the WebAssembly module into WebAssembly text format, using  
the wasm-dis binary, run the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/binaryen/wasm-dis add.wasm  
-o gen-add.wast 108 Installing and Using Binaryen  
2\. We generate the gen-add.wast file using the -o option with the filename  
\(gen-add.wast\)\:  
\(module  
\(type \$i32\_i32\_=\>\_i32 \(func \(param i32 i32\)  
\(result i32\)\)\)  
\(func \$0 \(param \$0 i32\) \(param \$1 i32\) \(result i32\)  
\(i32.add \(local.get \$0\) \(local.get \$1\) \)  
\)  
\)  
3. wasm-dis first validates the given file \(.wasm\) and then converts it into a  
.wat file. To check various options supported by wasm-dis, run the following  
command\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/binaryen/wasm-dis --help  
wasm-dis INFILE  
Un-assemble a .wasm \(WebAssembly binary format\) into a  
.wat \(WebAssembly text

Options\:  
--version Output version information and exit  
--help,-h Show this help message and exit  
--debug,-d Print debug information to stderr  
--output,-o Output file \(stdout if not specified\)  
--source-map,-sm Consume source map from the specified  
file to add location  
4. wasm-dis also provides verbose output that clearly explains how the  
WebAssembly module is structured. In order to see the structure of the  
WebAssembly module, we run it with the -d option\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/binaryen/wasm-dis  
add.wat -o gen-add.wast -d  
parsing binary...  
reading binary from add.wasm

== readFunctionSignatures  
...  
== processExpressions  
...  
== processExpressions finished  
end function bodies  
Printing...  
Opening 'gen-add.wast'  
Done.  
The previous output is a detailed description of how the .wast file is generated.  
First, it loads the given .wasm file. After that, it parses and validates the file. Finally,  
it creates gen-add.wast after reading the header, type, function signatures, and  
functions.  
While generating the file, we can enable the compiler to include the new and shiny  
features and disable various existing features using the appropriate enable-\* and  
disable-\* options, respectively.  
Additionally, we can also input sourcemap using the --sm \<filename\>  
option.  
Now that we have seen how to convert WASM to WAST, let's see how to optimize the  
WebAssembly binaries further.  
# wasm-opt  
The wasm-opt tool is a wasm-to-wasm optimizer. It will receive a WebAssembly  
module as input and run transformation passes on it to optimize and generate the  
optimized WebAssembly module. Let's look at the steps\:  
1\. Let's first create the inline-optimizer.wast file and add the following  
content\:  
\(module  
\(func \$parent \(export "parent"\) \(result i32\)  
\(i32.add  
\(call \$child\)  
\(i32.const 13\)  
\) 110 Installing and Using Binaryen  
\)  
\(func \$child \(result i32\) \(call \$grandChild\)\)  
\(func \$grandChild \(result i32\) \(call  
\$greatGrandChild\)\)  
\(func \$greatGrandChild \(result i32\) \(i32.const 7\)\)  
\)  
2\. To generate the WebAssembly module, we will run the following\:  
\$ /path/to/bin/folder/of/binaryen/wasm-opt inline-  
optimizer.wast -o inline.wasm --print  
\(module  
\(type \$0 \(func \(result i32\)\)\)  
\(export "parent" \(func \$parent\)\)  
\(func \$parent \(; 0 ;\) \(type \$0\) \(result i32\)  
\(i32.add  
\(call \$child\)  
\(i32.const 13\)  
\)  
\)  
\(func \$child \(; 1 ;\) \(type \$0\) \(result i32\)  
\(call \$grandChild\)  
\)  
\(func \$grandChild \(; 2 ;\) \(type \$0\) \(result i32\)  
\(call \$greatGrandChild\)  
\)  
\(func \$greatGrandChild \(; 3 ;\) \(type \$0\) \(result i32\)  
\(i32.const 7\)  
\)  
\)  
This will generate inline.wasm. The --print option prints the WebAssembly  
text format before converting it to the WebAssembly binary. We also passed in the  
-o option to output the WebAssembly module as inline.wasm\:  
60B inline-optimize.wasm  
273B inline-optimize.wat  
This generated binary of 60 bytes in memory. wasm2js 111  
3\. We can further optimize the binary with the --inlining-optimizing option\:  
\$ /path/to/bin/folder/of/binaryen/wasm-opt inline-  
optimizer.wast -o inline.wasm --print --inlining-  
optimizing  
This will optimize the functions and inline the functions where the binary is called.  
Let's check what the file size generated is\:  
39B inline-optimize.wasm  
273B inline-optimize.wat  
4\. The generated file is just 39 bytes, which is 35% less than the original binary.  
To check various options supported by wasm-opt, run the following command\:  
/path/to/bin/folder/of/binaryen/wasm-opt –help  
The wasm-opt tool helps us to optimize the WebAssembly binaries further. Let's next  
explore the wasm2js tool.  
# wasm2js  
The wasm2js tool converts WASM/WAST files into JavaScript files. Let's look at the steps\:  
1\. Create a file called add-with-export.wast\:  
\$ touch add-with-export.wast  
Then, add the following code\:  
\(module  
\(export "add" \(func \$add\)\)  
\(func \$add \(param \$x i32\) \(param \$y i32\)  
\(result i32\)  
\(i32.add  
\(local.get \$x\)  
\(local.get \$y\)  
\)  
\)  
\) 112 Installing and Using Binaryen  
2\. In order to convert the WebAssembly text format into JavaScript using wasm2js,  
run the following command\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/binaryen/wasm2js add-  
with-export.wast  
This will print out the generated JavaScript\:  
function asmFunc\(global, env\) \{  
var Math\_imul = global.Math.imul;  
var Math\_fround = global.Math.fround;  
var Math\_abs = global.Math.abs;  
var Math\_clz32 = global.Math.clz32;  
var Math\_min = global.Math.min;  
var Math\_max = global.Math.max;  
var Math\_floor = global.Math.floor;  
var Math\_ceil = global.Math.ceil;  
var Math\_sqrt = global.Math.sqrt;  
var abort = env.abort;  
var nan = global.NaN;  
var infinity = global.Infinity;  
function add\(x, y\) \{  
x = x | 0;  
y = y | 0;  
return x + y | 0 | 0;  
\}  
return \{  
"add"\: add  
\};  
\}  
var retasmFunc = asmFunc\(\{  
Math,  
Int8Array,  
Uint8Array,  
Int16Array,  
Uint16Array,  
Int32Array,  
Uint32Array, Summary 113  
Float32Array,  
Float64Array,  
NaN,  
Infinity  
\}, \{  
abort\: function\(\) \{ throw new Error\('abort'\); \}  
\}\);  
export var add = retasmFunc.add;  
The asmFunc function is defined. In asmFunc, we import the math functions from the  
global object. After that, we have an add function. The add function initializes x and y.  
The function returns the sum of two values. Finally, we return the add function.  
Note  
The generated JavaScript is asmjs and not normal JavaScript. We also  
imported a lot of functions from the global namespace in JavaScript into  
asmFunc.  
The wasm2js tool makes it easy to generate JavaScript from a WebAssembly module. The  
generated JavaScript module is faster than its normal JavaScript counterpart. This can be  
used as a polyfill for browsers that do not support WebAssembly yet.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we have seen how to install Binaryen and what the various tools provided  
by the Binaryen toolkit are. Binaryen makes it easier to convert WebAssembly modules  
into various formats. It is an important tool that makes your WebAssembly journey easier  
and more efficient.  
In the next chapter, we will start our Rust and WebAssembly journey. Section 3\:  
# Rust and

This section introduces Rust and how easy it is to generate WebAssembly modules from  
Rust. You will learn how the Rust ecosystem made WebAssembly a first-class citizen and  
what the various tools available are and how to use them.  
You will completely understand how to use Rust and WebAssembly together in a  
JavaScript application, as well as a little of WASI, by the end of this chapter.

# Integrating Rust  
# with WebAssembly  
Rust is a system-level programming language. Being a system-level programming  
language, Rust provides low-level memory management and the ability to represent data  
efficiently. Thus, it provides complete control to programmers and better performance.  
In addition to this, Rust also provides the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A friendly compiler – The Rust compiler is your companion when writing Rust.  
The compiler corrects you, guides you, and ensures that you write memory-safe  
code almost always.  
The ownership model – The ownership model ensures that we do not need garbage  
collection. This guarantees thread and memory safety in Rust.  
Safety, speed, and concurrency – Rust ensures safety and concurrency and makes  
you stay away from risks, crashes, and vulnerabilities.  
A modern language – Rust provides modern language syntax and the language is  
built to provide a better developer experience. 118 Integrating Rust with WebAssembly  
These features \(along with thousands of others\) ensure Rust is a general-purpose  
programming language. The highlight of the Rust language is that its compiler and  
community are always helpful.  
Rust provides first-class support for WebAssembly. Rust's rich toolchain makes it easier  
to get started with WebAssembly. Rust does not need a runtime, which makes it a perfect  
candidate for WebAssembly. In this chapter, we will see how to install Rust and explore  
various ways to convert Rust into a WebAssembly module. We will cover the following

Installing Rust  
Converting Rust into WebAssembly via rustc  
Converting Rust into WebAssembly via Cargo  
Installing wasm-bindgen  
Converting Rust into WebAssembly via wasm-bindgen  
Now let's hack into the Rust and WebAssembly world.  
# Technical requirements  
You can find the code files present in this chapter on GitHub at https\://github.  
com/PacktPublishing/Practical-WebAssembly.  
# Installing Rust  
Rust is a compiled language and its compiler is called the Rust compiler \(rustc\). Rust also  
has its own package manager, called Cargo. Cargo is similar to npm for Node.js. Cargo  
downloads package dependencies and builds, compiles, packs, and uploads the artifacts  
into crates \(Rust's version of packages\).  
The Rust language provides an easy way to install and manage Rust via rustup. rustup  
helps to install, update, and remove rustc, Cargo, and rustup itself. It makes it easy to  
install and manage various versions of Rust.  
Let's install Rust using the rustup tool and see how we can manage Rust versions using  
rustup.  
In Linux or macOS, use the following command\:  
\$ curl https\://sh.rustup.rs --sSf | sh Installing Rust 119  
The script will download and install the Rust language. Both rustc and Cargo are  
installed in \~/.cargo/bin and delegate any access to the underlying toolchain.  
For Windows, download and install the binaries from here\: https\://forge.rust-  
lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html. Both rustc and  
Cargo are installed in the users folder.  
Note  
You will require C++ build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later. You can  
install them from https\://visualstudio.microsoft.com/  
downloads/.  
Once the installation is completed successfully, you can check it by running the following  
command\:  
\$ rustc –version  
rustc 1.58.1 \(db9d1b20b 2022-01-20\)  
rustup is a toolchain multiplexer. It installs and manages many Rust toolchains and  
proxies them through the single set of tools installed at .cargo/bin in the home  
directory. Once rustup is installed, we can easily manage the rustc and cargo  
compilers. rustup also makes it easy to switch between nightly, stable, and beta versions  
of Rust.  
Rust provides WebAssembly compilation support in its stable version. We will also switch  
to the nightly build to make sure we get all the latest benefits.  
To switch to the nightly version, we have to run the following command\:  
\$ rustup default nightly  
This command will switch the default rustc to the nightly version. The rustc proxy in  
\~/.cargo/bin will run the nightly compiler instead of the stable compiler.  
To update to the latest version of nightly, we can run the following\:  
\$ rustup update  
Once successfully updated, we can check the current version installed by running the  
following\:  
\$ rustc --version  
rustc 1.55.0 \(c8dfcfe04 2021-09-06\) 120 Integrating Rust with WebAssembly  
Rust supports WebAssembly as a first-class citizen. Thus, rustc is capable of compiling  
Rust code into WebAssembly modules. Let's see how to convert Rust into WebAssembly  
via rustc.  
# Converting Rust into WebAssembly via rustc  
Rust uses the LLVM compiler we'll create now to generate machine-native code. rustc  
uses LLVM's capability to convert the native code into a WebAssembly module. We  
installed Rust in the previous section; let's start converting Rust into a WebAssembly  
module using rustc.  
We will start with Hello World\:  
1\. Let's create a file called hello\_world.rs\:  
\$ touch hello\_world.rs  
2\. Spin up your favorite editor and start writing the Rust code\:  
fn main\(\) \{  
println!\("Hello World!"\);  
\}  
We have defined a main function. Similar to C, main is a special function that  
marks the entry point to a program after it has been compiled as an executable.  
fn is the function keyword in Rust. main\(\) is the function name.  
println! is the macro. Macros in Rust allow us to abstract code at a syntactic  
level. A macro invocation is shorthand for an "expanded" syntactic form. This  
expansion happens early on in compilation, before any static checking.  
Note  
Macros are an interesting feature but explaining them is beyond the scope of  
this book. You can find more information here\: https\://doc.rust-  
lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html. Converting Rust into WebAssembly via rustc 121  
3\. We pass in the Hello World! string to the println! macro function. We can  
compile and generate the binary by running the following\:  
\$ rustc hello.rs  
4\. This will generate a hello binary. We can execute the binary and that will print  
Hello World!\:  
\$ ./hello  
Hello World!  
5\. Now, compile Rust into a WebAssembly module with rustc\:  
\$ rustc --target wasm32-unknown-emscripten  
hello\_world.rs -o hello\_world.html  
6\. This will generate the WebAssembly module.  
Let's run the generated code in the browser using the following command\:  
\$ python -m http.server  
Open your browser and head over to http\://localhost\:8000. Open the developer  
console to see Hello World! printed in it.  
To convert Rust into a WebAssembly module, we have used the --target flag. This flag  
instructs the compiler to compile and build the binary such that it runs on the provided  
runtime.  
We passed in wasm32-unknown-emscripten as a value to the --target flag.  
wasm32 indicates that the address space is 32 bits large. unknown tells the compiler that  
you don't know the system that you are compiling to. emscripten at the end notifies the  
compiler that you are targeting.  
So, with the wasm32-unknown-emscripten value, the compiler will compile on  
almost any machine but run only on the Emscripten runtime. Then, we specify the input  
file that needs to be compiled into the WebAssembly module. Finally, we specify the  
output with a -o flag. 122 Integrating Rust with WebAssembly  
It is important to understand what rustc does.  
Figure 7.1 – Rust compilation steps  
rustc first parses the input and produces the Abstract Syntax Tree \(AST\). Once the  
AST is generated, the compiler then recursively resolves the paths, expanding macros  
and other references. Once the AST is completely resolved, it will be converted into the  
High-level Intermediate Representation \(HIR\). This intermediate representation is like a  
desugared variant of AST.  
The HIR is then analyzed for type checking. After type checking, the HIR is postprocessed  
and converted into the Middle Intermediate Representation \(MIR\). From MIR, the  
compiler generates the LLVM Intermediate Representation \(LLVM IR\). After that,  
LLVM does the required optimizations on them.  
Now, with LLVM IR, it is easier to convert LLVM IR into WebAssembly modules. This is  
similar to how Emscripten converts C or C++ code into WebAssembly modules.  
Note  
Since we are using the wasm32-unknown-emscripten flag here, we  
need emcc to be available for converting the LLVM IR generated from Rust  
code into a WebAssembly module.  
We have seen how to use rustc to generate WebAssembly modules. It uses Emscripten  
behind the scenes to create them. But Rust provides another abstraction to generate  
WebAssembly modules, via Cargo.  
In the next section, we will see how to convert Rust into WebAssembly using Cargo. Converting Rust into WebAssembly via Cargo 123  
# Converting Rust into WebAssembly via Cargo  
Cargo makes it easier to create, run, download, compile, test, and run your project.  
The cargo command provides a wrapper that calls the rustc compiler to start the  
compilation. In order to create WebAssembly modules using Rust's toolchain, we will be  
using a different target, wasm32-unknown-unknown.  
The wasm32-unknown-unknown target adds zero runtime and toolchain footprint.  
wasm32 makes the compiler assume that only the wasm32 instruction set is present. The  
first unknown in unknown-unknown indicates the code can compile on any machine  
and the second indicates the code can run on any machine.  
To see it in action, let's create a new project with Cargo\:  
\$ cargo new --lib fib\_wasm  
Created library \`fib\_wasm\` package  
A new project called fib\_wasm is created. The new option creates a Rust project.  
The --lib flag informs Cargo to create a new library project rather than the default  
binary project.  
The binary project will produce the executable binary. The library project will create the  
library module.  
Spin up your favorite text editor and replace the contents of src/lib.rs with the  
following\:  
\#\[no\_mangle\]  
fn add\(x\: i32, y\:i32\) -\> i32 \{ x + y\}  
\#\[no\_mangle\] is a kind of annotation. This annotation informs the compiler not to  
mangle the names when generating the library.  
Then, we define the add function. The add function takes in two parameters, x and y. We  
define their types with i32 following the variable and a colon \(\:\). Finally, we define their  
return type using -\> i32.  
The function body has just x + y. Note, in Rust we do not need return keyword and ;  
at the end of the last statement, this shorts to return.  
Cargo also generates Cargo.toml. This file holds all the meta-information about the  
project, how to compile the Rust code, and their dependencies. 124 Integrating Rust with WebAssembly  
The Cargo.toml file looks like this\:  
\[package\]  
name = "fib\_wasm"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
It defines the package name, version, authors, and edition of Rust we are using.  
Here, we have to instruct the compiler what type of crate we are compiling. We can specify  
it under the \[lib\] segment and with the crate-type property.  
Open Cargo.toml and append the crate-type information inside\:  
\[package\]  
name = "fib\_wasm"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
cdylib here specifies a dynamic system library will be produced. This dynamic system  
library is used when the library has to be loaded from another language.  
Let's compile Rust into WebAssembly modules\:  
\$ cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown  
This will invoke rustc with the specified target. That will generate the WebAssembly  
module inside /target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/. Now, in order to run the  
WebAssembly module on the browser, let's manually create the HTML file and load it  
using JavaScript.  
Let's create an HTML file\:  
\$ touch index.html Converting Rust into WebAssembly via Cargo 125  
Add the following content to the file\:  
\<script\>  
\(async \(\) =\> \{  
const bytes = await fetch\("target/wasm32-unknown-  
unknown/debug/fib\_wasm.wasm"\);  
const response = await bytes.arrayBuffer\(\);  
const result = await WebAssembly.instantiate\(response, \{\}\);  
console.log\(result.instance.exports.add\(10,3\)\);  
\}\)\(\);  
\</script\>  
We defined the script inside the \<script\> tag. In HTML, we define JavaScript inside  
the \<script\> tag. We have added the Immediately Invoked Function Execution  
\(IIFE\) block with the async keyword. The async keyword specifies the function is  
asynchronous.  
First, we fetch the WebAssembly module. The WebAssembly module is generated in the  
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/ folder with the same name as the  
package name defined in Cargo.toml.  
The await keyword ensures the execution is awaited until we fetch the entire  
WebAssembly module.  
We then convert the collected bytes \(from the fetch call\) using bytes.arrayBuffer\(\).  
The response object will now have the WebAssembly module inside ArrayBuffer.  
We then instantiate the bytes array using the WebAssembly.instantiate function.  
The result object contains the entire WebAssembly module.  
The WebAssembly module result contains the instance property. The instance has  
the exports property. The exports property holds all the functions exported by the  
WebAssembly module.  
Since we added \#\[no\_mangle\], the exported function name is not changed. Hence, the  
exports property has the add function defined in it.  
We have used async-await here to make the syntax more elegant and contextually easier  
to understand.  
As expected, the preceding code will give an output of 13. You can check the output in the  
browser console. 126 Integrating Rust with WebAssembly  
Here, the cargo build command invokes rustc and compiles the Rust code into MIR  
and then into LLVM IR. The generated LLVM IR is then converted into a WebAssembly  
module. Let's make this function a bit more complicated. We can create a Fibonacci  
number generator with Rust and run the WebAssembly Module on the browser\:  
1\. Open src/lib.rs and replace everything with the following content\:  
\#\[no\_mangle\]  
fn fibonacci\(num\: i32\) -\> i32 \{  
match num \{  
0 =\> 0,  
1 =\> 1,  
\_ =\> fibonacci\(num-1\) + fibonacci\(num-2\),  
\}  
\}  
2\. Build it using cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown.  
Then, replace index.html such that we call the Fibonacci instead of the add\:  
\<script\>  
\(async \(\) =\> \{  
const bytes = await fetch\("target/wasm32-unknown-  
unknown/debug/fib\_wasm.wasm"\);  
const response = await bytes.arrayBuffer\(\);  
const result = await WebAssembly.instantiate\(response,  
\{\}\);  
result.instance.exports.fibonacci\(20\);  
\}\)\(\);  
\</script\>  
3\. Now, spin up the HTML server and check the browser's console for the  
Fibonacci value.  
So far, we have seen simple examples. But how can we pass functions and classes from  
JavaScript into WebAssembly and the other way around? In order to do more advanced  
bindings, Rust provides us with wasm-bindgen. Installing wasm-bindgen 127  
# Installing wasm-bindgen  
wasm-bindgen is used to bind entities from Rust into JavaScript and vice versa.  
wasm-bindgen makes it more natural to import exported entities from Rust into  
JavaScript. JavaScript developers will find that wasm-bindgen's use of WebAssembly is  
similar to JavaScript.  
This enables the use of richer and easier APIs while converting Rust into a WebAssembly  
module. wasm-bindgen uses these features and provides a simple API to use. It ensures  
that there is high-level interaction happening between wasm modules and JavaScript.  
wasm-bindgen provides a channel between JavaScript and WebAssembly to  
communicate something other than numbers, such as objects, strings, and arrays.  
To install wasm-bindgen-cli, use the following cargo command\:  
\$ cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli  
Once successfully installed, let's run the wasm-bindgen CLI\:  
\$ wasm-bindgen --help  
Generating JS bindings for a wasm file  
Usage\:  
wasm-bindgen \[options\] \<input\>  
wasm-bindgen -h | --help  
wasm-bindgen -V | --version  
Options\:  
-h --help Show this screen.  
--out-dir DIR Output directory  
--out-name VAR Set a custom output filename  
\(Without extension. Defaults to crate name\)  
--target TARGET What type of output to generate,  
valid  
values are \[web, bundler, nodejs, no-modules\],  
and the default is \[bundler\]  
--no-modules-global VAR Name of the global variable to  
initialize  
--browser Hint that JS should only be

--typescript Output a TypeScript definition 128 Integrating Rust with WebAssembly  
file \(on by default\)  
--no-typescript Don't emit a \*.d.ts file  
--debug Include otherwise-extraneous  
debug checks in output  
--no-demangle Don't demangle Rust symbol names  
--keep-debug Keep debug sections in wasm files  
--remove-name-section Remove the debugging \`name\`  
section of the file  
--remove-producers-section Remove the telemetry  
\`producers\` section  
--encode-into MODE Whether or not to use  
TextEncoder\#encodeInto,  
valid values are \[test,z always, never\]  
--nodejs Deprecated, use \`--target nodejs\`  
--web Deprecated, use \`--target web\`  
--no-modules Deprecated, use \`--target  
no-modules\`  
-V --version Print the version number of  
wasm-bindgen  
Let's take a look at the various options wasm-bindgen supports.  
To generate the file in a particular directory and with a particular name, the tool has  
--out-dir and --out-name, respectively. To reduce or optimize the generated  
WebAssembly module size, wasm-bindgen has the following flags\:  
•  
•  
--debug\: The --debug option includes extra debugging information in the  
generated WebAssembly module. This will increase the size of the WebAssembly  
module but it is useful in development.  
--keep-debug\: This WebAssembly module may or may not have custom  
sections. These custom sections can be used to hold the debugging information.  
These custom sections will be helpful while debugging the application \(such as in  
browser developer tools\). This will increase the size of the WebAssembly module.  
This is useful in development. Converting Rust into WebAssembly via wasm-bindgen 129  
•  
--no-demangle\: This flag tells wasm-bindgen not to demangle the Rust  
symbol names. Demangling allows the end user to use the same name that they  
have defined in the Rust file.  
•  
•  
--remove-name-section\: This will remove the debugging name section of the  
file. We will see more about the various sections in a WebAssembly module later.  
This will decrease the size of the WebAssembly module.  
--remove-producers-section\: WebAssembly modules can have a producer  
section. This section will hold information about how the file was produced or  
who produced the file. By default, producer sections are added to a generated  
WebAssembly module. With this flag, we can remove it. It saves a few more bytes.  
wasm-bindgen provides options to generate the binding file for both Node.js and the  
browser environment. Let's see those flags\:  
•  
•  
--nodejs\: This generates output that only works for Node.js. No ESModules.  
--browser\: This generates output that only works for the browser.  
With ESModules.  
•  
--no-modules\: This generates output that only works for the browser. No  
ESModules. Suitable for browsers that don't support ESModules yet.  
The type definition files \(\*.d.ts\) can be switched off by using the --no-typescript  
flag.  
Now we have installed wasm-bindgen, let's take it for a spin.  
# Converting Rust into WebAssembly via wasm-  
# bindgen  
Let's start with a Hello World example with wasm-bindgen\:  
1\. Create a new project with Cargo\:  
\$ cargo new --lib hello\_world  
Created library \`hello\_world\` package  
This will create a new Rust project with all the necessary files. 130 Integrating Rust with WebAssembly  
2\. Open the project in your favorite editor. Open the Cargo.toml file to add  
crate-type and add the wasm-bindgen dependency\:  
\[package\]  
name = "hello\_world"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.38"  
3\. We define the dependency under the \[dependencies\] table in the toml file.  
Open the src/lib.rs file and replace the contents with the following\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn hello\(\) -\> String \{  
"Hello World".to\_string\(\)  
\}  
We import the wasm\_bindgen library using use wasm\_bingen\:\:prelude\:\:\* and  
then annotate the function with \# \[wasm\_bindgen\]. The hello function  
returns String.  
To generate the WebAssembly module, we will first run the following command\:  
\$ cargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown  
This will generate the WebAssembly module. But this module cannot run by itself.  
WebAssembly only supports passing numbers between the native code and JavaScript. But  
we are returning a String here.  
In order to pass any value \(other than numbers\), we need to create a binding JavaScript  
file. This binding file is nothing more than a translator that translates the String \(and  
other types\) into start, length, arrayBuffer. Converting Rust into WebAssembly via wasm-bindgen 131  
In order to generate the binding files, we need to run the wasm-bindgen CLI tool on the  
generated WebAssembly module\:  
\$ wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-  
unknown/debug/hello\_world.wasm --out-dir .  
We run wasm-bindgen and pass it to the generated target/wasm32-unknown-  
unknown/debug/hello\_world.wasm WebAssembly module. The --out-dir flag  
tells the wasm-bindgen CLI tool where to save the generated files. Here, we are asking  
for the files to be generated in the current folder.  
We can see the files that are generated inside the folder\:  
\$ ls -lrta  
-rw-r--r-- 1 sendilkumar staff 1769 hello\_world.js  
-rw-r--r-- 1 sendilkumar staff 88 hello\_world.d.ts  
-rw-r--r-- 1 sendilkumar staff 227 hello\_world\_bg.d.ts  
-rw-r--r-- 1 sendilkumar staff 67132 hello\_world\_bg.wasm  
The cargo build command generates the WebAssembly module. The wasm-bindgen  
CLI takes this WebAssembly module as input and generates the necessary bindings. The  
size of the binding JavaScript file is around 1.8 KB.  
The generated files are as follows\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The WebAssembly module \(hello\_world\_bg.wasm\)  
The JavaScript binding file \(hello\_world.js\)  
The type definition file for the WASM \(hello\_world.d.ts\)  
The type definition file for the JavaScript \(hello\_world\_bg.d.ts\)  
The JavaScript binding file is enough for us to load and run the WebAssembly module.  
Note  
There is also a TypeScript file generated.  
Let's now check what the binding file contains\:  
import \* as wasm from './hello\_world\_bg.wasm'; 132 Integrating Rust with WebAssembly  
The binding file imports the WebAssembly module\:  
const lTextDecoder = typeof TextDecoder === 'undefined' ?  
require\('util'\).TextDecoder \: TextDecoder;  
let cachedTextDecoder = new lTextDecoder\('utf-8'\);  
It then defines TextDecoder, to decode the string from the shared ArrayBuffer.  
Note  
Since there are no input arguments available, there is no need for  
TextEncoder \(that is, to encode the string from JavaScript into shared  
memory\). wasm-bindgen will generate only the necessary things inside the  
binding file.  
Modern browsers have built-in TextDecoder and TextEncoder support. wasm-  
bindgen checks and uses the decoder if present; otherwise, it loads it using polyfill.  
The shared memory between JavaScript and the WebAssembly module need not be  
initialized every time. We can initialize it once and use it throughout the lifetime of  
the execution. We have the following two methods to load the memory once and use it  
throughout the lifetime of the execution\:  
function getUint8Memory\(\) \{ ... \}  
function getUint32Memory\(\) \{ ... \}  
Then, we get a String from Rust to JavaScript. This String is passed via the shared  
memory. So, we can use the pointer to the offset and the length of the String to retrieve  
it. The following function is used for retrieving the String from the WebAssembly  
module\:  
function getStringFromWasm\(ptr, len\) \{ .... \}  
We define the heap at the very end. This is where we will store all the JavaScript variables  
referenceable from the WebAssembly module. The \_\_wbindgen\_object\_drop\_ref  
function is used to free up the slot occupied by the JavaScript reference count. Converting Rust into WebAssembly via wasm-bindgen 133  
Finally, we have the hello function\:  
export function hello\(\) \{  
const retptr = globalArgumentPtr\(\);  
wasm.hello\_world\(retptr\);  
const mem = getUint32Memory\(\);  
const rustptr = mem\[retptr / 4\];  
const rustlen = mem\[retptr / 4 + 1\];  
const realRet = getStringFromWasm\(rustptr,  
rustlen\).slice\(\);  
wasm.\_\_wbindgen\_free\(rustptr, rustlen \* 1\);  
return realRet;  
\}  
The hello function is exported. We first get the pointer for the argument. This pointer  
refers to a location in the shared array buffer. Then, we call the hello function in the  
WebAssembly module.  
Note that we are passing in a \(pointer to the\) argument here. But we have defined the  
function without any arguments on the Rust side. We will briefly see how rustc has  
rewritten the code.  
Then, we get the shared memory. Note that this is a 32-bit array. We get the pointer in  
which the result is stored and the length of the output string. Note that these are stored  
successively.  
Finally, we will get the string from rustptr and rustlen. Once we have received the  
output, we will clear the allocated memory using wasm.\_\_wbindgen\_free.  
To understand what happens on the Rust side, let's use the cargo-expand command to  
expand the macro and see how the code is generated.  
Note  
Check https\://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-expand for how  
to install cargo-expand. It is not mandatory for the course of this book.  
But cargo-expand will help you understand what wasm-bindgen actually  
generates.  
Open your terminal, go to the project's base directory, and run the following command\:  
cargo expand --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown \> expanded.rs 134 Integrating Rust with WebAssembly  
The preceding command will create a file called expanded.rs. If you take a look in the  
file generated, you will see how the simple \#\[wasm\_bindgen\] annotation changes the  
verbose part of exposing the function. The wasm-bindgen adds all the necessary metadata  
that is required for the compiler to convert Rust code into a WebAssembly module. To  
load and run the generated files, we can use bundlers such as webpack or Parcel. We will  
see how these bundlers help in more detail in later chapters. For now, let's see how to run  
and load the generated files\:  
Note  
The following setup is common and we will refer to it as the "default" webpack  
setup in future examples. Create a webpack-config.js file to tell  
webpack how to handle the files.  
const path = require\('path'\);  
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require\('html-webpack-plugin'\);  
module.exports = \{  
entry\: './index.js',  
output\: \{  
path\: path.resolve\(\_\_dirname, 'dist'\),  
filename\: 'bundle.js',  
\},  
plugins\: \[  
new HtmlWebpackPlugin\(\),  
\],  
mode\: 'development'  
\};  
This is a standard webpack configuration file with an HTMLWebpackPlugin plugin. This  
plugin helps us to generate a default index.html instead of manually creating it.  
Let's add a package.json file to bundle the dependencies for running webpack\:  
\{  
"scripts"\: \{  
"build"\: "webpack",  
"serve"\: "webpack-dev-server"  
\},  
"devDependencies"\: \{  
"html-webpack-plugin"\: "\^3.2.0", Summary 135  
"webpack"\: "\^4.29.4",  
"webpack-cli"\: "\^3.1.1",  
"webpack-dev-server"\: "\^3.1.0"  
\}  
\}  
Create an index.js file to load the binding JavaScript, which in turn loads the  
WebAssembly module generated\:  
import\("./hello\_world"\).then\(module =\> \{  
console.log\(module.hello\_world\(\)\);  
\}\);  
Now, head over to the terminal and install the npm dependencies using the following  
command\:  
\$ npm install  
Run webpack-dev-server\:  
\$ npm run serve  
Go to the URL http\://localhost\:8080 and open the developer console in the  
browser to see "Hello World" printed.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we saw how to install Rust using rustup. rustup helps us to install,  
update, remove, and switch different versions of Rust. We saw how rustc works and  
then converted Rust into WebAssembly using rustc. After that, we explored Cargo, the  
package manager for Rust. Finally, we installed wasm-bindgen and compiled Rust code  
into a WebAssembly module using wasm-bindgen.  
In the next chapter, we will explore what wasm-pack is and how it helps to build and  
pack WebAssembly modules. 8  
# Bundling  
# WebAssembly Using  
# wasm-pack  
JavaScript is omnipresent, but being everywhere is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  
There are many different ecosystems that have various standards and purposes. Building a  
unique solution for all ecosystems is not practical.  
Despite all this, the JavaScript community is doing a wonderful job here. The effort from  
the community makes JavaScript one of the go-to languages. For a language as versatile as  
JavaScript, there will be some weird corners \(which of course every language has\). When  
you are writing JavaScript, these need extra care and attention.  
JavaScript is dynamically typed. This makes it difficult \(almost impossible\) to avoid  
runtime exceptions. While TypeScript, Flow, and Elm try to provide a \(typed\) superset on  
JavaScript's dynamic types, they cannot completely fix the underlying problem.  
For any language to grow, it has to evolve fast, which JavaScript does. Evolving fast  
without breaking the existing usage is also important and JavaScript provides polyfills to  
make it backward compatible. 138 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
But creating polyfills is a mundane task. There are various other mundane steps, such as  
bundling and packaging libraries, minifying bundles, and lazy-loading libraries, to name a  
few. Bundlers provide a solution to most of them. They act as a compiler for the frontend.  
So far, we have seen how Rust makes it easy to create and run WebAssembly modules. In  
this chapter, we will explore wasm-pack, a tool that makes it easier to pack and publish  
WebAssembly modules. We will cover the following sections in this chapter\:

You can find the code files present in this chapter on GitHub at https\://github.  
com/PacktPublishing/Practical-WebAssembly.  
# Bundling WebAssembly modules  
# with webpack  
webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. So, what does  
it do?  
You can consider webpack as an informal compiler for the frontend. webpack takes in an  
entry point of an application, slowly runs through the modules, and builds a dependency  
graph. The dependency graph holds all the modules. These modules are necessary for the  
application to run.  
Once the dependency graph is built, webpack outputs one or more bundles. Webpack is  
very flexible, helping us to bundle or package JavaScript as we need it and the options are  
provided in the webpack configuration. Based on the provided options, webpack creates  
the output.  
Well, that sounds simple, right?  
It was that simple a few years ago when the only library that we needed was jQuery.  
But due to JavaScript's rapid evolution, there are a lot of different things happening now.  
The underlying runtime is not the same. There are three different browser engines and  
various targets. Bundling WebAssembly modules with webpack 139  
Browser engines evolve at different speeds and browsers support various versions of  
JavaScript. In some workplace machines, upgrading browsers to the latest version is  
prohibited. This means the running JavaScript application needs tweaking and polyfills at  
various times.  
The underlying target system needs a certain tweak to make your JavaScript code run.  
Doing all this by hand will take a long time to complete and will be error-prone.  
There are various flavors of JavaScript, including TypeScript and CoffeeScript. They  
are different, but they will compile down to JavaScript before running. Browser-based  
development needs CSS, SCSS, SASS, and LESS. Supporting all those variations and  
compiling them manually after every change is not an easy deal.  
JavaScript's answer to all this is bundlers. Whether you hate them or love them, bundlers  
reduce the overload and remove the clutter when developing with JavaScript.  
webpack provides a solution to all these problems and more.  
webpack is a tool built for bundling JavaScript applications. It comes with loaders and  
plugins that will help to convert, add, remove, and manipulate the output bundles. The  
most interesting part of webpack is its loaders and plugins, which propel the ability of  
webpack to the fullest.  
Loaders allow us to load or import a Rust, CSS, or TypeScript file like any other module  
inside JavaScript. webpack then takes care of producing the bundle that will support the  
target environment as specified.  
Plugins allow us to optimize and manage the bundles produced. It is important to note  
that webpack is built entirely on top of this plugin system.  
How does webpack help with WebAssembly?  
webpack internally depends on the webassemblyjs library. So, all the applications  
that use webpack are already WebAssembly-ready. All you have to do is start loading the  
WebAssembly file as normal JavaScript and webpack will take care of the rest.  
In the webpack configuration, we will define the entry point. webpack then loads the entry  
file. The import statements in the entry file are loaded as a module based on JavaScript's  
module resolution algorithm. If the imported module is a WebAssembly module, it gets  
the module's content and hands it over to the webassemblyjs compiler. 140 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
The compiler is responsible for parsing and mutating the WebAssembly modules.  
Did You Know?  
webassemblyjs can parse the WebAssembly text format and  
WebAssembly binary format out of the box.  
The compiler generates the abstract syntax tree \(AST\). The generated AST is then  
validated. Once the validation is successful, any custom sections in the WebAssembly  
module are removed.  
The custom section is a section inside the WebAssembly module where users can store  
custom information about the WebAssembly module. This information may include  
names of the function and local variables. Browsers may then use this information to have  
a better debugging process.  
webpack also does not support the start section. The start section is a section in a  
WebAssembly module that will be called as soon as the WebAssembly module is loaded.  
Instead, webpack creates a function and calls it after the WebAssembly module is loaded.  
webassemblyjs removes the start section and converts the start function into a normal  
function on the WebAssembly module. Then, webpack takes care of generating the  
wrapper that calls the function as soon as the module is loaded.  
Finally, webassemblyjs is also responsible for optimizing the binary and eliminating  
dead code from the WebAssembly module.  
webassemblyjs comes with an interpreter and CLI, which makes it easy to experiment  
with the WebAssembly modules.  
Code, refresh, and repeat.  
This was the workflow for web development for a long time. Live reloading provides an  
extra pair of hands to web developers. Live reloading can automatically compile and  
reload the changes once the code is saved. The code can be shared across multiple devices,  
factors, and orientations. Interactions in one place can automatically be synchronized with  
other devices. While the web provides a medium to deliver software easily, it comes in  
various forms. These forms are feature phones, smartphones, tablets, laptops, computers,  
ultra-wide monitors, 360-degree virtual worlds, and so on. Supporting all or some of them  
is an uphill task. Live reloading works like an extra pair of hands.  
webpack provides multiple options to add live reloading to your application. It provides  
plugins for live reloading tools, such as BrowserSync. The webpack ecosystem also  
provides a watch mode in its configuration. Bundling WebAssembly modules with webpack 141  
The watch mode, once enabled, looks for any changes that happen in the source file and its  
directory. Once the changes are detected, it will recompile automatically. But watch mode  
is for recompiling input into output.  
The automatic reloading of web pages is provided by a library called webpack-dev-server.  
webpack-dev-server is an in-memory web server. The contents are generated and are  
placed in memory rather than in actual files in the filesystem.  
In addition to that, webpack-dev-server also supports Hot Module Replacement. This  
allows the server to patch only the changes in the browser rather than doing a full page  
refresh.  
Let's see how we can enable live reloading in a WebAssembly project\:  
1\. First, we will create a new Rust project\:  
\$ cargo new --lib live\_reload  
Created library \`live\_reload\` package  
2\. Once the project is created, open it in your favorite editor. To define the wasm-  
bindgen dependency for the project, open the Cargo.toml file\:  
\[package\]  
name = "live\_reload"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.38"  
3\. First, add the \[lib\] section and add crate-type = \["cdylib"\]. With the  
crate-type option, we are instructing the compiler that the library is dynamic.  
After that, add the wasm-bindgen dependency to the \[dependencies\] tag.  
Then, open the src/lib.rs file and replace the contents with the following\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\] 142 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
pub fn hello\_world\(\) -\> String \{  
"Hello World".to\_string\(\)  
\}  
4\. We will reuse the simple Hello World example from previous chapters here. Build  
the WASM module using the following\:  
\$ cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown  
\$ wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-  
unknown/debug/live\_reload.wasm --out-dir .  
5\. Then create a webpack.config.js file to instruct webpack on how to handle  
and compile the files\:  
const path = require\('path'\);  
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require\('html-webpack-  
plugin'\);  
module.exports = \{  
entry\: './index.js',  
output\: \{  
path\: path.resolve\(\_\_dirname, 'dist'\),  
filename\: 'bundle.js',  
\},  
plugins\: \[  
new HtmlWebpackPlugin\(\),  
\],  
experiments\: \{  
syncWebAssembly\: true,  
\},  
mode\: 'development'  
\};  
6\. Add a package.json file to download the webpack dependencies\:  
\{  
"scripts"\: \{  
"build"\: "webpack",  
"serve"\: "webpack-dev-server" Bundling WebAssembly modules with webpack 143  
\},  
"devDependencies"\: \{  
"html-webpack-plugin"\: "\^5.5.0",  
"webpack"\: "\^5.64.1",  
"webpack-cli"\: "\^4.9.1",  
"webpack-dev-server"\: "\^4.5.0"  
\}  
\}  
Note  
Please use the latest version of the dependencies applicable here.  
7\. Create an index.js file to load the binding JavaScript that in turn loads the  
WebAssembly module generated\:  
import\("./live\_reload"\).then\(module =\> \{  
console.log\(module.hello\_world\(\)\);  
\}\);  
8\. Now, head over to the terminal and install the npm dependencies using the  
following\:  
\$ npm install  
Run webpack-dev-server using the following\:  
\$ npm run serve  
We have already used webpack-dev-server to enable automatic recompiling. We can now  
go and change the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file. Once we save the changes, the webpack  
server will compile everything. Once compiled, the changes are reflected in the browser.  
But wait, what will happen if you change the Rust file? Let's try changing it\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn hello\_world\(\) -\> String \{  
"Hello Universe".to\_string\(\)  
\} 144 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
We made a huge change in our main.rs file. Yeah, we changed from world to universe;  
isn't that huge? But once you save the file, you will not see any changes in the browser. In  
fact, even the webpack compiler is not recompiling things.  
The webpack compiler by default looks for the changes that will happen in the HTML,  
CSS, and JavaScript files \(things that are defined in the configuration file and those that  
are included inside the dependency graph\). But it has no idea about the Rust code.  
We need to somehow tell webpack to look for the code changes in Rust. We can use a  
plugin for that, one that will look at any changes in the specified location of the specified  
file type. Then, it will retrigger the build process. We will use wasm-pack-plugin  
for this.  
Add the wasm-pack-plugin dependency to the application using the following  
command\:  
\$ npm i @wasm-tool/wasm-pack-plugin -D  
Then, hook this plugin into webpack's plugin system via the webpack.config.js file\:  
const path = require\('path'\);  
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require\('html-webpack-plugin'\);  
const WasmPackPlugin = require\('@wasm-tool/wasm-pack-  
plugin'\);  
module.exports = \{  
entry\: './index.js',  
output\: \{  
path\: path.resolve\(\_\_dirname, 'dist'\),  
filename\: 'bundle.js',  
\},  
plugins\: \[  
new HtmlWebpackPlugin\(\),  
new WasmPackPlugin\(\{  
crateDirectory\: path.resolve\(\_\_dirname\)  
\}\),  
\],  
experiments\: \{  
syncWebAssembly\: true,  
\}, Bundling WebAssembly modules with Parcel 145  
mode\: 'development'  
\};  
We import wasm-pack-plugin. We specify the crate directory in which the  
Cargo.toml file is present and then the plugin will take care of the auto-reloading part.  
To see it in action, let's stop and start the webpack server using npm run serve.  
Now, let's edit the src/main.rs file with Hello Galaxy. Open the browser to see the  
console log changed to Hello Galaxy already.  
So, what happens here?  
wasm-pack-plugin is hooked into webpack using webpack's plugin system. This  
will run along with the webpack compiler. If any changes are made in the src directory,  
wasm-pack-plugin will then run the wasm-pack compilation to compile the Rust  
code into WebAssembly modules automatically. This will trigger a recompilation in the  
webpack compiler. Once the webpack compiler recompiles, it will notify webpack-  
dev-server to reload the changes in the browser. The browser then reloads the changes  
automatically.  
wasm-pack-plugin makes it easy to run Rust and WebAssembly along with webpack.  
Now, let's check how we can run Rust and WebAssembly with Parcel.  
# Bundling WebAssembly modules with Parcel  
Parcel is a blazing-fast, zero-configuration web application bundler. Parcel is the new kid  
in the web application bundler space. It is built from scratch to be fast and needs zero  
configuration. The main pain point of webpack is its configuration. Although it looks  
simpler to start with, it gradually becomes more complex and unmanageable when  
the application grows. But the configuration will give a complete overview of what is  
happening and how it is bundling. With zero configuration, Parcel will infer the bundle  
from the initial point \(that is, index.html\) and then build the entire graph from there.  
While webpack has a plugin-based architecture, Parcel has a worker-based architecture.  
This enables Parcel to be faster than webpack as it uses multicore compilation and cache.  
Parcel also has inbuilt configuration to support JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files. Just like  
webpack, it also has various plugins that we can use to configure the bundler to produce  
the required output.  
It also has inbuilt transformation support using standard Babel, PostCSS, and PostHTML  
when it is required. We can extend them and change them via plugins if needed. 146 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
Parcel also has automatic, out-of-the-box hot module replacement to track and record  
changes to files \(that are recorded by the dependency graph\). Let's build WebAssembly  
modules using parcel as a bundler\:  
1\. We will start by creating a new Rust project\:  
\$ cargo new --lib live\_reload\_parcel  
Created library \`live\_reload\_parcel\` package  
2\. Once the project is created, open the project in your favorite editor.  
To define the wasm-bindgen dependency for the project, open the Cargo.toml  
file\:  
\[package\]  
name = "live\_reload\_parcel"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.38"  
3\. First, remove the \[dependencies\] tag and replace it with the bold lines above.  
We are telling the compiler that the library that is getting generated will be dynamic  
and it has a dependency on the wasm-bindgen library.  
Then, we open the src/lib.rs file and replace the contents with the following\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn hello\_world\(\) -\> String \{  
"Hello World".to\_string\(\)  
\} 4\. 5. 6. Bundling WebAssembly modules with Parcel 147  
We will reuse the simple Hello World example here. Build the wasm module using  
the following\:  
\$ cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown  
\$ wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-  
unknown/debug/live\_reload\_parcel.wasm --out-dir .  
Since Parcel supports zero configuration, all we need to do is add Parcel  
dependencies to package.json\:  
\{  
"scripts"\: \{  
"build"\: "parcel index.html",  
"serve"\: "parcel build index.html"  
\},  
"devDependencies"\: \{  
"parcel-bundler"\: "\^1.12.3"  
\}  
\}  
Since Parcel is a zero-configuration bundler, we just have to define the entry point  
to it. We define the entry point in the scripts section. The serve command is  
the command that we use to run the code for development purposes. When we  
define parcel build index.html, we are informing Parcel that the entry  
point is index.html.  
Note  
Please use the latest version applicable here.  
Then, we will create the entry point. We will create an index.html file as specified  
in the package.json script\:  
\<html\>  
\<head\>  
...  
\<script src="./index.js"\> \</script\>  
\</head\>  
\<body\> ... \</body\>  
\</html\> 148 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
7\. Create an index.js file to load the binding JavaScript, which in turn loads the  
WebAssembly module generated\:  
import \{ module \} from './live\_reload\_parcel.js';  
module.hello\_world\(\);  
8\. Now, head over to the terminal. Run the following command to install the  
dependencies\:  
\$ npm install  
Run the Parcel application using the following\:  
\$ npm run serve  
9\. Parcel's zero-configuration nature makes it extremely easy to get started with  
WebAssembly. By default, Parcel supports .wasm files. We can even import .wasm  
files just like any other .js file.  
It is important to note that synchronously importing WebAssembly modules is still  
not supported. But we can write an import as a synchronous import. Internally,  
Parcel will generate the necessary extra code to preload the file before JavaScript  
execution starts.  
This implies the WebAssembly file will be a separate bundle rather than in line with  
the bundled JavaScript file.  
Let's change the Rust file and see what happens\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn hello\_world\(\) -\> String \{  
"Hello Universe".to\_string\(\)  
\}  
10\. Once you save the file, you will not see any changes. Parcel has no clue that you have  
changed the source and the compiler will not react.  
To make Parcel react to the Rust source changes, we need to add a plugin. The  
plugin is parcel-plugin-wasm.rs.  
11\. To install the plugin, we can run the following\:  
npm install -D parcel-plugin-wasm.rs Bundling WebAssembly modules with Parcel 149  
This will download the plugin to node\_modules. This will also save the plugin in  
package.json's devDependencies.  
12\. Once installed, we need to change index.js such that it looks at the source code  
directly instead of referencing from the Cargo.toml file\:  
import \{ hello\_world \} from './src/lib.rs';  
// import \{ hello\_world \} from './Cargo.toml';  
hello\_world\(\);  
Here, instead of importing from the WebAssembly module, we specify the entry  
Rust file. We can even specify the location of the Cargo.toml file to make Parcel  
look for changes in the respective places.  
13\. Now, let's edit the src/main.rs file with Hello Galaxy. Open the browser to see  
how the console log has changed to Hello Galaxy.  
So, what happens here?  
Parcel just requires the starting point of our application. It will generate the dependency  
graph from there. The parcel plugin keeps looking for any changes in the folder to happen.  
It basically looks in the folder that contains the Cargo.toml file. The Cargo.toml  
location is given to the Parcel bundler and its plugin via index.js.  
So, any changes that happen to the Rust file will lead to the following process.  
When the Rust file is saved, the watchers inside parcel-plugin-wasm.rs are  
triggered. Then, parcel-plugin-wasm.rs will initiate the compilation process of the  
Rust code into WebAssembly via wasm-pack. Once wasm-pack compiles and produces  
new WebAssembly code, the plugin will notify the Parcel compiler that something in the  
dependency graph has been changed.  
The Parcel compiler then recompiles, which will result in the browser being refreshed. The  
browser now displays the changed message.  
Note that for Parcel, we actually used a synchronous module import, while for webpack,  
we were relying on asynchronous import.  
The parcel-plugin-wasm.rs plugin makes it easy to run Rust and WebAssembly  
along with Parcel. Now, let's check how we can install and use wasm-pack to pack and  
publish WebAssembly modules. 150 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
# Introducing wasm-pack  
To be compatible with JavaScript, Rust-based WebAssembly applications should be  
completely interoperable with the JavaScript world. Without that, it will be difficult for  
developers to bootstrap their WebAssembly projects in JavaScript.  
The node modules completely changed the perspective of the JavaScript world. They make  
it easier to develop and share the modules between Browser and Node environments.  
Developers around the world can use these libraries wherever and whenever they want.  
The wasm-pack tool seeks to be a one-stop shop for building and working  
with Rust-generated WebAssembly that you would like to interoperate  
with JavaScript, in the browser or with Node.js. - wasm-pack website.  
https\://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack  
# Why do you need wasm-pack?  
wasm-pack makes it easy to build and pack Rust- and WebAssembly-based projects.  
Once packed, the module is ready to be shared with the world via the npm registry – just  
like millions \(or even billions\) of JavaScript libraries out there.  
# How to use wasm-pack  
wasm-pack is available as a Cargo library. If you are following along with this book,  
then you might have already installed Cargo. To install wasm-pack, run the following  
command\:  
\$ cargo install wasm-pack  
The preceding command will download, compile, and install the wasm-pack library.  
Once installed, the wasm-pack command will be available.  
To check whether wasm-pack is installed correctly, run the following\:  
\$ wasm-pack --version  
wasm-pack 0.6.0 Introducing wasm-pack 151  
Once you have wasm-pack installed, let's see how to use wasm-pack to build and pack  
Rust and WebAssembly projects\:  
1\. We will first generate a new project with Cargo. To generate the project, use the  
following\:  
\$ cargo new --lib wasm\_pack\_world  
Created library \`wasm\_pack\_world\` package  
2\. Once the project is created, open it in your favorite editor.  
To define the wasm-bindgen dependency for the project, open the cargo.toml  
file\:  
\[package\]  
name = "wasm\_pack\_world"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.38"  
3\. First, remove the \[dependencies\] tag and replace that with the wasm-  
bindgen library. We are telling the compiler that the library that is getting  
generated will be dynamic and it has a dependency to the wasm-bindgen library.  
Then, we open the src/lib.rs file and replace the contents with the following\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn get\_me\_universe\_answer\(\) -\> i32 \{  
42  
\} 152 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
4\. Again, this is a simple function that returns a number \(which is the universal  
answer\).  
Previously, we used to build the Rust and WebAssembly application with rustc or  
Cargo. This produced a WebAssembly binary. But the binary is not useful by itself; it  
needs a binding file. With wasm-bindgen, we will generate the binding file along  
with the WebAssembly binary.  
These two steps are mandatory, but they are mundane. We can replace them with  
wasm-pack.  
To build the WebAssembly application with wasm-pack, run the following  
command\:  
\$ wasm-pack build  
When we run wasm-pack build, this is what happens\:  
I. wasm-pack first checks whether the Rust compiler is installed. If it's  
installed, then it checks whether the Rust compiler is greater than version  
1.30.  
II. wasm-pack checks for the crate configuration and whether the library  
indicates that we are generating a dynamic library.  
III. wasm-pack validates whether there is any wasm-target available for  
building. If the wasm32-unknown-unknown target is not available, wasm-  
pack will download and add the target.  
IV. Once the environment is ready, wasm-pack then starts compiling the  
module and build the WebAssembly Module and binding JavaScript files.  
Note that the wasm-pack command also generates the package.json file. The  
package.json file looks similar to this\:  
\{  
"name"\: "wasm\_pack\_world",  
"collaborators"\: \[  
"Sendil Kumar"  
\],  
"version"\: "0.1.0",  
"files"\: \[  
"wasm\_pack\_world\_bg.wasm",  
"wasm\_pack\_world.js",  
"wasm\_pack\_world.d.ts"  
\], Packing and publishing using wasm-pack 153  
"module"\: "wasm\_pack\_world.js",  
"types"\: "wasm\_pack\_world.d.ts",  
"sideEffects"\: "false"  
\}  
5\. 6. Finally, it copies over the Readme and LICENSE file if we have one, to ensure there  
is shared documentation between the Rust and WebAssembly versions.  
wasm-pack also checks for the presence of wasm-bindgen-cli, which, if not  
present, will be installed using Cargo.  
When the build has successfully finished, it will create a pkg directory. Inside pkg,  
it will pipe the output of wasm-bindgen\:  
pkg  
├── package.json  
├── wasm\_pack\_world.d.ts  
├── wasm\_pack\_world.js  
├── wasm\_pack\_world\_bg.d.ts  
└── wasm\_pack\_world\_bg.wasm  
Now, this pkg folder can be bundled and shared like any other JavaScript module. We'll  
see how to achieve that in the future recipes.  
wasm-pack is a great tool to pack and publish WebAssembly modules. Now, let's check  
out how to use it.  
# Packing and publishing using wasm-pack  
The most amazing \(and, of course, the most important\) thing for a library developer to  
do is to pack and publish artifacts. That is why we spend our days and nights carefully  
crafting the application, publishing it to the world, receiving feedback \(either negative or  
positive\), and then enhancing the application based on that.  
The critical point for any project is its first release, which defines the fate of the project.  
Even though it is simply an MVP, it will give the world a glimpse of what we are working  
on and gives us a glimpse of what we have to work on in the future. 154 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
wasm-pack helps us to build, pack, and publish Rust- and WebAssembly-based  
projects into the npm registry. We have already seen how wasm-pack makes it simpler  
to build Rust into the WebAssembly binary along with the binding JavaScript file using  
wasm-bindgen underneath. Let's further explore what we can do with its pack and  
publish flags.  
wasm-pack provides a pack flag to pack the artifacts that were generated using the  
wasm-pack build command. Although it is not necessary to use wasm-pack to build  
binaries, it generates all the boilerplate that we will need to pack the artifacts into a  
Node module.  
In order to pack the built artifacts using wasm-pack, we have to run the following  
command with reference to pkg \(or the directory with which we generated our  
build artifacts\)\:  
\$ wasm-pack pack pkg  
We can also run the command by passing in project\_folder/pkg as its argument.  
Without any argument, the wasm-pack pack command will search for the pkg  
directory in the current working directory where it is running.  
The wasm-pack pack command first identifies whether the folder provided is a pkg  
directory or contains a pkg directory as its immediate child. If the check passes, then  
wasm-pack will invoke the npm pack command underneath, to pack the library into an  
npm package.  
To bundle the npm package, all we need is a valid package.json file. That file is  
generated by the wasm-pack build command.  
We can run the pack command inside the cg-array-world example from our  
previous recipe and check what happens\:  
\$ wasm-pack pack  
npm notice  
npm notice 📦 cg-array-world@0.1.0  
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===  
npm notice 313B package.json

| 🎒 packed up your package!  
As you can see here, the pack command creates a tarball package with the contents inside  
the pkg folder with the help of the npm pack command.  
Once we have packed our application, the obvious next step will be to publish it. In order  
to publish the tarball generated, wasm-pack has a publish option.  
In order to publish the package, we have to run the following command\:  
\$ wasm-pack publish  
The wasm-pack publish command will first check whether the pkg directory is  
already present in the directory provided.  
If the pkg directory is not present, then it will ask whether you want to create the package  
first\:  
\$ wasm-pack publish  
Your package hasn't been built, build it? \[Y/n\]  
If you answer Y to the question, then it asks for you to input the folder in which you want  
to generate the build artifacts. We can give any folder name or use the default\:  
\$ wasm-pack publish  
Your package hasn't been built, build it? yes  
out\_dir\[default\: pkg\]\: 156 Bundling WebAssembly Using wasm-pack  
Then, it asks for your target, that is, the target in which the build should be generated. You  
can choose between the various options here, as discussed in the build recipe\:  
\$ wasm-pack publish  
Your package hasn't been built, build it? yes  
out\_dir\[default\: pkg\]\: .  
target\[default\: browser\]\:  
\> browser  
nodejs  
no-modules  
Based on the option provided, it will generate the artifact in the specified folder.  
Once the artifacts are produced, they are then ready to be published using npm publish.  
For npm publish to work correctly, we need to be authenticated. You can authenticate to  
npm by using either npm login or wasm-pack login.  
The wasm-pack login command will invoke the underlying npm login command and  
then create a session\:  
\$ wasm-pack login  
Username\: sendilkumarn  
Password\: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
login succeeded.  
The wasm-pack publish command also supports two options, namely the following\:  
•  
•  
-a or --access to determine the access level of the package to be deployed.  
This accepts either public or restricted\:  
 public – Makes the package public  
 restricted – Makes the package internal  
-t or --target to support various targets in which the build is produced.  
Thus, wasm-pack makes it easy to pack and publish WebAssembly binaries. Summary 157  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we saw how to run a WebAssembly project with bundlers such as webpack  
and Parcel. Parcel and webpack make it easy for JavaScript developers to run and develop  
Rust and WebAssembly projects. Then, we installed wasm-pack and used it to run the  
project. Finally, we used wasm-pack to pack and publish the WebAssembly module  
to npm.  
In the next chapter, we will explore how to share complex objects between Rust and  
WebAssembly with wasm-bindgen. 9  
# Crossing the  
# Boundary  
# between Rust and  
# WebAssembly  
So far, we have only seen examples of sharing simple numbers between JavaScript and  
WebAssembly. In the last section, we saw how wasm-bindgen helps to pass a string  
from Rust to JavaScript with ease. In this chapter, we will explore how wasm-bindgen  
makes it easier to convert more complex data types between JavaScript and WebAssembly  
via Rust. We will cover the following sections in this chapter\:

# Sharing classes from Rust with JavaScript  
wasm-bindgen enables sharing classes from JavaScript with Rust and vice versa  
using simple annotations. It handles all the boilerplate stuff, such as translating a value  
from JavaScript to WebAssembly or WebAssembly to JavaScript, complex memory  
manipulations, and error-prone pointer arithmetic. Thus, wasm-bindgen makes  
everything easier.  
Let's see how easy it is to share classes between JavaScript and WebAssembly \(from Rust\)\:  
1\. Create a new project\:  
\$ cargo new --lib class\_world  
Created library \`class\_world\` package  
2\. Define the wasm-bindgen dependency for the project. Open the cargo.toml  
file and add the following content\:  
\[package\]  
name = "class\_world"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.68"  
3\. Open the src/lib.rs file and replace the content with the following\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub struct Point \{  
x\: i32,  
y\: i32,  
\} Sharing classes from Rust with JavaScript 161  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
impl Point \{  
pub fn new\(x\: i32, y\: i32\) -\> Point \{  
Point \{ x\: x, y\: y\}  
\}  
pub fn get\_x\(&self\) -\> i32 \{  
self.x  
\}  
pub fn get\_y\(&self\) -\> i32 \{  
self.y  
\}  
pub fn set\_x\(&mut self, x\: i32\) \{  
self.x = x;  
\}  
pub fn set\_y\(&mut self, y\:i32\) \{  
self.y = y;  
\}  
pub fn add\(&mut self, p\: Point\) \{  
self.x = self.x + p.x;  
self.y = self.y + p.y;  
\}  
\}  
Note  
The &mut before the argument specifies that the argument \(in this case,  
self\) is a mutable reference.  
Rust does not have classes but we can define a class via a struct. The Point struct  
contains getters, setters, and an add function. This is normal Rust code with only  
the \#\[wasm\_bindgen\] annotation added.  
Note  
The functions and struct were explicitly marked pub. The pub modifier  
means the function is public and will be exported. 162 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
4\. Generate the WebAssembly module using Cargo\:  
\$ cargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown  
5\. Use the wasm-bindgen CLI to generate the binding file for the WebAssembly  
module generated\:  
\$ wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-  
unknown/debug/class\_world.wasm --out-dir .  
This will generate the binding files and type definition files as we have seen in the  
previous chapter. Let's look at the class\_world.js file first. This file will be  
similar to the file generated in previous chapters except for the Point class. The  
Point class has all the getters, the setters, and the add function in it. The functions  
use the pointer to their references.  
Additionally, wasm-bindgen produces a static method called \_\_wrap that creates the  
Point class object and attaches a pointer to it. It adds a free method that in turn calls  
the \_\_wbg\_point\_free method inside the WebAssembly module. This method is  
responsible for freeing up the memory taken by the Point object or class.  
Create the following files. We will use them in the other sections too\:  
1\. Create webpack.config.js. This holds the webpack configuration\:  
const path = require\('path'\);  
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require\('html-webpack-  
plugin'\);  
module.exports = \{  
entry\: './index.js',  
output\: \{  
path\: path.resolve\(\_\_dirname, 'dist'\),  
filename\: 'bundle.js',  
\},  
plugins\: \[  
new HtmlWebpackPlugin\(\),  
\],  
mode\: 'development'  
\}; Sharing classes from Rust with JavaScript 163  
2\. Create package.json and add the following content\:  
\{  
"scripts"\: \{  
"build"\: "webpack",  
"serve"\: "webpack-dev-server"  
\},  
"dependencies"\: \{  
"html-webpack-plugin"\: "\^3.2.0",  
"webpack"\: "\^4.41.5",  
"webpack-cli"\: "\^3.3.10",  
"webpack-dev-server"\: "\^3.10.1"  
\}  
\}  
3\. Create an index.js file\:  
\$ touch index.js  
4\. Then, run npm install. Modify index.js with the following content\:  
import\("./class\_world"\).then\(\(\{Point\}\) =\> \{  
const p1 = Point.new\(10, 10\);  
console.log\(p1.get\_x\(\), p1.get\_y\(\)\);  
const p2 = Point.new\(3, 3\);  
p1.add\(p2\);  
console.log\(p1.get\_x\(\), p1.get\_y\(\)\);  
\}\);  
5\. We call the new method in the Point class and pass it x and y. We print the x and  
y coordinates. This will print 10, 10. Then, we will create another point \(p2\).  
Finally, we call the add function and pass it point p2. This will print 13, 13.  
The getter method uses the pointer and fetches the value from the shared array\:  
get\_x\(\) \{  
return wasm.point\_get\_x\(this.ptr\);  
\} 164 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
6\. In the setter method, we pass in the pointer and the value. Since we are just passing  
in a number here, there is no extra conversion needed\:  
set\_x\(arg0\) \{  
return wasm.point\_set\_x\(this.ptr, arg0\);  
\}  
7\. In the case of add, we take the argument, get the pointer to the Point object, and  
pass it to the WebAssembly module\:  
add\(arg0\) \{  
const ptr0 = arg0.ptr;  
arg0.ptr = 0;  
return wasm.point\_add\(this.ptr, ptr0\);  
\}  
wasm-bindgen makes it simple to convert a class into a WebAssembly module. We have  
seen how to share a class in Rust with JavaScript. Now, we will see how to share a class  
from JavaScript with Rust.  
# Sharing classes from JavaScript with Rust  
Sharing JavaScript classes with Rust is also made easy with \#\[wasm\_bindgen\]. Let's  
look at how to achieve it.  
JavaScript classes are objects with some methods. Rust is a strictly typed language. This  
means the Rust compiler needs to have concrete bindings. Without them, the compiler  
complains, because it needs to know about the lifetime of an object. We need a way to  
ensure the compiler has this API available at runtime.  
The extern C function block helps out here. The extern C makes a function name available  
in Rust.  
In this example, let's see how to share a class from JavaScript with Rust\:  
1\. Let's create a new project\:  
\$ cargo new --lib class\_from\_js\_world  
Created library \`class\_from\_js\_world\` package 2\. 3. Sharing classes from JavaScript with Rust 165  
Define the wasm-bindgen dependency for the project. Open the cargo.toml  
file and add the following content\:  
\[package\]  
name = "class\_from\_js\_world"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.68"  
Please copy over package.json, index.js, and webpack-config.js from  
the previous section. Then, run npm install.  
Open the src/lib.rs file and replace the contents with the following\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\(module = "./point"\)\] . // 1  
extern "C" \{  
pub type Point; // 2  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\(constructor\)\] //3  
fn new\(x\: i32, y\: i32\) -\> Point;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\(method, getter\)\] //4  
fn get\_x\(this\: &Point\) -\> i32;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\(method, getter\)\]  
fn get\_y\(this\: &Point\) -\> i32;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\(method, setter\)\] //5  
fn set\_x\(this\: &Point, x\:i32\) -\> i32;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\(method, setter\)\]  
fn set\_y\(this\: &Point, y\:i32\) -\> i32;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\(method\)\] // 6 166 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
fn add\(this\: &Point, p\: Point\);  
\}  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
fn get\_precious\_point\(\) -\> Point \{ //7  
let p = Point\:\:new\(10, 10\);  
let p1 = Point\:\:new\(3, 3\);  
p.add\(p1\); // 8  
p  
\}  
At //1, we are importing the JavaScript module. This will import a JavaScript file,  
point.js. Note that this file should be present in the same directory as Cargo.  
toml. Then, we create an extern C block to define the methods that we need to use.  
We first declare a type in the block \(pub type Point;\). Now, we can use this  
as any other type in the Rust code. After that, we define a list of functions. We first  
define the constructor. We pass in the constructor as an argument to the \#\[wasm\_  
bindgen\] annotation. Define a function that takes in arguments and returns the  
type declared previously. This will bind to the namespace of the Point type, and we  
can call Point\:\:new\(x, y\); inside the Rust function.  
Then, we define getters and setters \(//4 and //5, respectively\). We can even define  
a method; these are analogous to the function on the JavaScript side. Then, we have  
the add function.  
Note  
All the functions inside the extern C block are completely typed.  
4\. Finally, we are exporting the get\_precious\_point\(\) function using the  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\] annotation. In the get\_precious\_point function,  
we create two Point with Point\:\:new\(x, y\), then add two points using  
p1.add\(p2\).  
We can call this from JavaScript just like we did before. We also have to define a  
Point class on the JavaScript side.  
Create Point.js with the following content\:  
export class Point \{  
constructor\(x, y\) \{  
this.x = x; 5\. 6. 7. Sharing classes from JavaScript with Rust 167  
this.y = y;  
\}  
get\_x\(\) \{  
return this.x;  
\}  
get\_y\(\) \{  
return this.y;  
\}  
set\_x\(x\) \{  
this.x = x;  
\}  
set\_y\(y\) \{  
this.y = y;  
\}  
add\(p1\) \{  
this.x += p1.x;  
this.y += p1.y;  
\}  
\}  
Finally, replace index.js with the following\:  
import\("./class\_from\_js\_world"\).then\(module =\> \{  
console.log\(module.get\_precious\_point\(\)\);  
\}\);  
Now, run the following command to start the server\:  
\$ npm run serve  
Open the browser and run http\://localhost\:8000. Open the developer  
console to see the printed object class. 168 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
8\. Let's see how the \#\[wasm\_bindgen\] macro is expanding the code\:  
\$ cargo expand --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown \>  
expanded.rs  
There are a few interesting things happening here.  
First, the type point is converted into a struct. This is similar to what we did in the  
previous example. But the struct's members are JsValue instead of x and y. This is  
because wasm\_bindgen will not know what this Point class is instantiating. So, it  
creates a JavaScript object and makes that its member\:  
pub struct Point \{  
obj\: \:\:wasm\_bindgen\:\:JsValue,  
\}  
It also defines how to construct the Point object and how to dereference it. This  
is useful for the WebAssembly runtime to know when to allocate and when to  
dereference it.  
All the methods that are defined are converted into the implementation of the Point  
struct. As you can see, there is a lot of unsafe code in the method declaration. This is  
because the Rust code interacts directly with the raw pointers\:  
fn new\(x\: i32, y\: i32\) -\> Point \{  
\#\[link\(wasm\_import\_module =  
"\_\_wbindgen\_placeholder\_\_"\)\]  
extern "C" \{  
fn \_\_wbg\_new\_3ffc5ccd013f4db7\(x\:\<i32 as  
\:\:wasm\_bindgen\:\:convert\:\:IntoWasmAbi\>\:\:Abi, y\:\<i32 as  
\:\:wasm\_bindgen\:\:convert\:\:IntoWasmAbi\>\:\:Abi\) -\> \<Point  
as \:\:wasm\_bindgen\:\:convert\:\:FromWasmAbi\>\:\:Abi;  
\}  
unsafe \{  
let \_ret = \{  
let mut \_\_stack =  
\:\:wasm\_bindgen\:\:convert\:\:GlobalStack\:\:new\(\);  
let x = \<i32 as  
\:\:wasm\_bindgen\:\:convert\:\:IntoWasmAbi\>\:\:into\_abi  
\(x, &mut \_\_stack\);  
let y = \<i32 as Calling the JavaScript API via WebAssembly 169  
\:\:wasm\_bindgen\:\:convert\:\:IntoWasmAbi\>\:\:into\_abi  
\(y, &mut \_\_stack\);  
\_\_wbg\_new\_3ffc5ccd013f4db7\(x, y\)  
\};  
\<Point as  
\:\:wasm\_bindgen\:\:convert\:\:FromWasmAbi\>\:\:from\_abi\(\_ret,  
&mut \:\:wasm\_bindgen\:\:convert\:\:GlobalStack\:\:new\(\)\)  
\}  
\}  
Shown in the previous code is the code generated by the \#\[wasm\_  
bindgen\(constructor\)\] macro. It first links the code with the extern C block.  
The arguments are then cast such that they are inferred in WebAssembly.  
Then, we have the unsafe block. First, space is reserved in the global stack. Then,  
both x and y are converted into the IntoWasmAbi type.  
IntoWasmAbi is a trait for anything that can be converted into a type that can  
cross the WebAssembly ABI directly, for example, u32 or f64. Then, the function  
in JavaScript is called. The returned value is then cast into a Point type using  
FromWasmAbi.  
FromWasmAbi is a trait for anything that can be recovered by value from the  
WebAssembly ABI boundary; for example, a Rust u8 can be recovered from the  
WebAssembly ABI u32 type.  
We have seen how to share a class in JavaScript with Rust. Now, we will see how we can  
call a JavaScript API in Rust.  
# Calling the JavaScript API via WebAssembly  
JavaScript provides a rich API to work with objects, arrays, maps, sets, and so on. If we  
want to use or define them in Rust, then we need to provide the necessary bindings.  
Handcrafting those bindings will be a huge process. But what if we have bindings to those  
APIs? That is a common API for both Node.js and a browser environment that will create  
a platform where we can write the code completely in Rust and use wasm\_bindgen to  
create necessary code. 170 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
The rustwasm team's answer to that is the js-sys crate.  
The js-sys crate contains raw \#\[wasm\_bindgen\] bindings to all the  
global APIs guaranteed to exist in every JavaScript environment by the  
ECMAScript standard. – RustWASM  
They provide bindings to JavaScript's standard built-in objects, including their methods  
and properties.  
In this example, let's see how to call a JavaScript API via WebAssembly\:  
1\. Create a default project with the cargo new command\:  
\$ cargo new --lib jsapi  
2\. 3. Copy over webpack.config.js, index.js, and package.json similarly to  
the previous example. Then, open the generated project in your favorite editor.  
Change the contents of Cargo.toml\:  
\[package\]  
name = "jsapi"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.68"  
js-sys = "0.3.45" 4\. 5. 6. Calling the JavaScript API via WebAssembly 171  
Now, open src/lib.rs and replace the file with the following content. We can  
create a JavaScript map inside Rust using the following snippet\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
use js\_sys\:\:Map;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn new\_js\_map\(\) -\> Map \{  
Map\:\:new\(\)  
\}  
Added to the wasm\_bindgen import, we imported the map from the js\_sys  
crate using use js\_sys\:\:Map;.  
Then, we define the new\_js\_map function, which will return a new map\:  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn set\_get\_js\_map\(\) -\> JsValue \{  
let map = Map\:\:new\(\);  
map.set\(&"foo".into\(\), &"bar".into\(\)\);  
map.get\(&"foo".into\(\)\)  
\}  
The set\_get\_js\_map function creates a new map, sets a value in the map, and  
then returns the value set.  
Note that the return type here is JsValue. This is a wrapper in Rust for specifying  
the JavaScript values. Also, note that we are passing the string into the trait  
functions get and set. This will return bar as the output when called in JavaScript.  
We now also run through the map using for\_each inside the Rust code like this\:  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn run\_through\_map\(\) -\> f64 \{  
let map = Map\:\:new\(\);  
map.set\(&1.into\(\), &1.into\(\)\);  
map.set\(&2.into\(\), &2.into\(\)\);  
map.set\(&3.into\(\), &3.into\(\)\);  
map.set\(&4.into\(\), &4.into\(\)\);  
map.set\(&5.into\(\), &5.into\(\)\);  
let mut res\: f64 = 0.0; 172 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
map.for\_each\(&mut |value, \_| \{  
res = res + value.as\_f64\(\).unwrap\(\);  
\}\);  
res  
\}  
7\. This creates a map and then loads the map with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Then, it  
runs over the created map and adds the value together. This will produce an output  
of 15 \(that is, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\).  
Lastly, we replace index.js with the following content\:  
import\("./jsapi"\).then\(module =\> \{  
let m = module.new\_js\_map\(\);  
m.set\("Hi", "Hi"\);  
console.log\(m\); // prints Map \{ "Hi" -\> "Hi" \}  
console.log\(module.set\_get\_js\_map\(\)\); // prints  
"bar"  
console.log\(module.run\_through\_map\(\)\); // prints  
15  
\}\);  
Running this on the browser will print the result. Refer to the comments near the  
console log statements.  
Let's start with the generated JavaScript binding file. The generated binding JavaScript file  
has almost the same structure as in the previous section, but with a few more functions  
exported.  
The heap object is used as a stack here. All the JavaScript objects that are shared or  
referenced with the WebAssembly modules are stored in this heap. It is also important to  
note that once a value is accessed, it is popped out from the heap.  
function takeObject\(idx\) \{  
const ret = getObject\(idx\);  
dropObject\(idx\);  
return ret;  
\} Calling closures via WebAssembly 173  
The takeObject function is used to fetch the object from the heap. It first gets the object  
at the given index. Then, it removes the object from that heap index \(that is, it pops it out\).  
Finally, it returns the value ret.  
Similarly, we can use JavaScript APIs inside Rust. The bindings are only generated for the  
common JavaScript API \(including Node.js and the browser\).  
We have seen how to call the JavaScript API in Rust. Now, we will see how we can call a  
Rust closure via WebAssembly.  
# Calling closures via WebAssembly  
The official Rust book defines closures as follows\:  
Closures are anonymous functions which you can save in a variable or  
can be passed as arguments to other functions. - The Rust Programming  
Language \(Covers Rust 2018\) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols  
\(https\://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-00-functional-  
features.html\)  
MDN defines a closure for JavaScript as follows\:  
A closure is the combination of a function and lexical environment  
within which that function was declared.- MDN Web Docs \(https\://  
developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/  
Closures\#closure\)  
In general, closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that are tossed around and  
used in the code. They can capture and store references to the variables from the context  
in which they are defined.  
Closures and functions are similar except for a subtle difference. Closures will capture the  
state when it is first created. Then, whenever a closure is called, it closes over that captured  
state.  
Closures are functions with a state. When you create a closure, it captures the state. Then,  
we can pass around closures just like any other function. When a closure is then invoked,  
it closes over this captured state and executes \(even when the closure is invoked outside  
of their captured state\). That is one of the important reasons why the use of closures is  
increasing on the functional side of JavaScript. 174 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
Closures make it easy to do data encapsulation, higher-order functions, and memoization.  
\(Sounds functional, right? ;\)\)  
Let's see how to share closures from JavaScript to Rust and vice versa\:  
1\. Create a new project\:  
\$ cargo new --lib closure\_world  
Created library \`closure\_world\` package  
2\. Define the wasm-bindgen dependency for the project. Let's open the cargo.  
toml file and add the content highlighted in bold\:  
\[package\]  
name = "closure\_world"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.38"  
js-sys = "0.3.15"  
3\. We will need the js-sys crate to copy over the closures from JavaScript into Rust.  
Please copy over package.json, index.js, and webpack-config.js from  
the previous section. Then, run npm install.  
We then open the src/lib.rs file and add the content from our Point class  
example with an additional method that takes in JavaScript's closure function as its  
argument\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub struct Point \{  
x\: i32,  
y\: i32,  
\} Calling closures via WebAssembly 175  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
impl Point \{  
pub fn new\(x\: i32, y\: i32\) -\> Point \{  
Point \{ x\: x, y\: y\}  
\}  
pub fn get\_x\(&self\) -\> i32 \{  
self.x  
\}  
pub fn get\_y\(&self\) -\> i32 \{  
self.y  
\}  
pub fn set\_x\(&mut self, x\: i32\) \{  
self.x = x;  
\}  
pub fn set\_y\(&mut self, y\:i32\) \{  
self.y = y;  
\}  
pub fn add\(&mut self, p\: Point\) \{  
self.x = self.x + p.x;  
self.y = self.y + p.y;  
\}  
pub fn distance\(&self, js\_func\: js\_sys\:\:Function\)  
-\> JsValue \{  
let this = JsValue\:\:NULL;  
let x = JsValue\:\:from\(self.x\);  
let y = JsValue\:\:from\(self.y\);  
js\_func.call2\(&this, &x, &y\).unwrap\(\)  
\}  
\} 176 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
Now, we will change index.js to call the distance function with a closure\:  
import\("./closure\_world"\).then\(\(\{Point\}\) =\> \{  
const p1 = Point.new\(13, 10\);  
console.log\(p1.distance\(\(x, y\) =\> x - y\)\);  
\}\);  
Let's spin the webpack server with npm run serve. This will print out 3.  
The js-sys crate offers an option to invoke the JavaScript function using the apply and call  
method. That is what we have done by calling js\_func.call2\(&this, &x, &y\).  
Rust does not have function overloading. This means that we have to use different method  
names based on the number of arguments that we pass. So, js-sys offers us call1,  
call2, call3, and so on, each taking 1, 2, 3, and so on arguments, respectively.  
Invoking a JavaScript function in Rust will return Result\<JsValue, Error\>. We  
will unwrap the result to get the JsValue and return it. wasm-bindgen will create the  
necessary binding to return the value as a number in JavaScript.  
On the other hand, passing a closure from Rust to JavaScript will need some extra  
information and options.  
wasm-bindgen supports two variants here\:  
•  
Stack lifetime closures  
•  
Heap-allocated closures  
Let's see what they actually mean\:  
•  
•  
Stack lifetime closures should not be invoked by JavaScript again once the imported  
JavaScript function that the closure was passed to returns. This is because once  
the function \(closure\) returns, the closure will be invalidated by Rust. Any future  
invocations will lead to an exception. In other words, stack lifetime closures are  
short-lived and they go out of context once they are accessed.  
On the other hand, heap-allocated closures are useful for invoking the memory  
multiple times. Here, the validity is tied to the lifetime of the closure in Rust.  
Once the closure in Rust is dropped, the closure will deallocate and garbage will  
be collected. This will in turn invalidate the closure \(function\) in JavaScript. Once  
invalidated, any further attempts to access the closure or memory will raise an  
exception.  
Both the stack lifetime and heap-allocated closures support both Fn and FnMut closures,  
arguments, and return values. Importing the JavaScript function into Rust 177  
We have seen how to call a closure function. Now, we will see how to import a function  
from JavaScript into Rust.  
# Importing the JavaScript function into Rust  
In certain places, JavaScript is faster than WebAssembly because there is no overhead of  
boundary crossing and instantiating a separate runtime environment. JavaScript runs  
more naturally in its own environment.  
The JavaScript ecosystem is huge. There are millions of libraries created and battle tested  
\(not all of them, of course\) with JavaScript. This makes JavaScript easy \(easy here is  
subjective\).  
WebAssembly addresses the most important problem that we have in the frontend world,  
that of "consistent" performance. But it is not a complete replacement for JavaScript.  
WebAssembly helps JavaScript to deliver better and more consistent performance.  
JavaScript will be a default choice in most places. It is important to provide an ecosystem  
that allows seamless integration between the two. We have already seen how to import  
a class from JavaScript into Rust. Similarly, we can import anything from JavaScript into  
Rust using wasm-bindgen. The most important part is that we can more naturally use  
these imported JavaScript functions inside Rust code.  
In this example, let's see how to import a JavaScript function into Rust\:  
1\. Create a new project\:  
\$ cargo new --lib import\_js\_world  
Created library \`import\_js\_world\` package  
2\. Define the wasm-bindgen dependency for the project. Let's open the cargo.  
toml file and add the content highlighted in bold\:  
\[package\]  
name = "import\_js\_world"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\] 178 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.38"  
3\. Please copy over package.json, index.js, and webpack-config.js from  
the previous section. Then, run npm install. Then, open the src/lib.rs file  
and replace its content with the following\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\(module = "./array"\)\]  
extern "C" \{  
fn topArray\(\) -\> f64;  
fn getNumber\(\) -\> i32;  
fn lowerCase\(str\: &str\) -\> String;  
\}  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn sum\_of\_square\_root\(\) -\> f64 \{  
let n = getNumber\(\);  
let mut sum = 0;  
for \_ in 0..n \{  
sum = sum + \(topArray\(\).sqrt\(\) as i64\);  
\}  
sum  
\}  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn some\_string\_to\_share\(\) -\> String \{  
lowerCase\("HEYA! I AM ALL CAPS"\)  
\} 4\. 5. Importing the JavaScript function into Rust 179  
We start by importing the wasm\_bindgen library. Then, we define the extern  
C block to define the FFI functions \(that is, the functions that we import from  
JavaScript\). Inside the extern C block, we define the function signature similar to  
what the Rust compiler understands. We also annotate the extern C block with  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\(module ="./array"\)\]. This helps the wasm-bindgen  
CLI to understand where the functions are defined and exported. It will use this  
information and create the necessary link.  
The array.js file is in the same directory as the cargo.toml file. We will define  
array.js as follows\:  
let someGlobalArray = \[1, 4, 9, 16, 25\];  
export function getNumber\(\) \{  
return someGlobalArray.length;  
\}  
export function topArray\(\) \{  
return someGlobalArray.sort\(\).pop\(\);  
\}  
export lowerCase\(str\) \{  
return str.toLowerCase\(\);  
\}  
The functions mentioned previously should be exported in the JavaScript file.  
We then declare a function \(sum\_of\_square\_root\) in Rust and export it  
as a function in the WebAssembly module that is generated. We first call the  
getNumber\(\) method from JavaScript. We use the return value and then run the  
for loop for the length of the array. For each loop, we call topArray to get the  
lowest element from the array. Then, we take the square root of the number \(this  
happens in Rust code\). Sum them up and return the sum \(15 for the example that  
we saw previously\).  
We will replace index.js with the following content\:  
import\("./import\_js\_world"\).then\(module =\> \{  
console.log\(module.sum\_of\_square\_root\(\)\);  
console.log\(module.some\_string\_to\_share\(\)\);  
\}\); 180 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
6\. 7. 8. Let's run the previous code with npm run serve. Go to the URL and open  
the developer console. 15 and HEYA! I AM ALL CAPS will be printed in  
the console.  
Open the generated binding JavaScript file. It will be interesting to see that both the  
getNumber and topArray functions are not available in the generated binding  
JavaScript file. The main reason for this is we are just sharing numbers between the  
JavaScript and the WebAssembly module. Hence, the boundary crossing happens  
more naturally in this case.  
But there will be a function exported for the some\_string\_to\_share function.  
This is because we are sharing a string, which needs conversion. So, the binding file  
will make the necessary conversion to work with the string. It is also important to  
note that there is a getInt64Memory function. This is because we are returning  
f64 as output. wasm-bindgen converts the number into bigInt and returns it  
to JavaScript.  
wasm-bindgen also does the necessary shifting and parsing of the byte buffer  
based on the byte size of the memory object. For Uint32Array, the pointer and  
memory are calculated as follows\:  
const rustptr = mem\[retptr / 4\];  
const rustlen = mem\[retptr / 4 + 1\];  
9\. For BigInt64Array, the pointer and memory are calculated as follows\:  
const rustptr = mem\[retptr / 8\];  
const rustlen = mem\[retptr / 8 + 1\];  
We have seen how to import a JavaScript function into Rust. Now, we will see how we can  
call a web API in Rust.  
# Calling a web API via WebAssembly  
The evolution of the web has been phenomenal, with its growth being attributed to its  
open standards. Today, the web provides hundreds of APIs, which makes it easy for web  
developers to develop for audio, video, canvases, SVGs, USBs, batteries, and so on. Calling a web API via WebAssembly 181  
The web is universal and omnipresent. It is continuously experimented with and  
changed to make it desirable and easy for developers and companies to use, respectively.  
The web-sys crate provides access to almost all the APIs that are available on the web at  
the moment.  
The web-sys crate provides raw bindings to all the Web's APIs\: everything  
from DOM manipulation to WebGL to Web Audio to timers to fetch and  
more! – web-sys crates.io \(https\://crates.io/crates/web-sys\)  
The WebIDL interface definitions are converted into wasm-bindgen's internal abstract  
syntax trees \(ASTs\). Then, these ASTs are used to create zero-overhead Rust and  
JavaScript glue code.  
With the help of this binding code, we can call and manipulate the web APIs. Converting  
the web APIs into Rust ensures the type information of parameters and return values is  
handled correctly and safely.  
In this example, let's call a web API via WebAssembly\:  
1\. Create a default project with the cargo new command\:  
\$ cargo new --lib web\_sys\_api  
Created library \`web\_sys\_api\` package  
2\. Copy over webpack.config.js, index.js, and package.json similarly to  
the jsapi section \(in the above section\). We'll now open the generated project in  
our favorite editor. Let's change the contents of cargo.toml\:  
\[package\]  
name = "web\_sys\_api"  
version = "0.1.0"  
authors = \["Sendil Kumar"\]  
edition = "2018"  
\[lib\]  
crate-type = \["cdylib"\]  
\[dependencies\]  
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.38"  
\[dependencies.web-sys\]  
version = "0.3.4" 182 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
features = \[  
'Document',  
'Element',  
'HtmlElement',  
'Node',  
'Window',  
\]  
3\. The major difference here is that instead of just defining the dependency and its  
version, we also defined the features that we will be using in this example.  
Why do we need it? Since there is a huge number of APIs in the web ecosystem, we  
do not want to carry bindings for all of them. The binding files are created and used  
only for the listed features.  
Let's open src/lib.rs and replace the file with the following content\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn draw\(percent\: i32\) -\> Result\<web\_sys\:\:Element,  
JsValue\> \{  
let window = web\_sys\:\:window\(\).unwrap\(\);  
let document = window.document\(\).unwrap\(\);  
let div = document.create\_element\("div"\)?;  
let ns = Some\("http\://www.w3.org/2000/svg"\);  
div.set\_attribute\("class", "pie"\)?;  
let svg = document.create\_element\_ns\( ns, "svg"\)?;  
svg.set\_attribute\("height", "100"\)?;  
svg.set\_attribute\("width", "100"\)?;  
svg.set\_attribute\("viewBox", "0 0 32 32"\)?;  
let circle = document.create\_element\_ns\(ns,  
"circle"\)?;  
circle.set\_attribute\("r", "16"\)?;  
circle.set\_attribute\("cx", "16"\)?; Calling a web API via WebAssembly 183  
circle.set\_attribute\("cy", "16"\)?;  
circle.set\_attribute\("stroke-dasharray",  
&\(percent.to\_string\(\).to\_owned\(\) +" 100"\)\)?;  
svg.append\_child\(&circle\)?;  
div.append\_child\(&svg\)?;  
Ok\(div\)  
\}  
4\. We first fetch the window using web\_sys\:\:window\(\). The unwrap at the end  
makes sure the window is available. If it is not, it will throw an error. After that,  
we get the document from the window object. We then create a div element with  
document.createElement. Then, we create an SVG and circle document  
element and append the circle to the SVG element. Finally, we append the SVG as a  
child to the div element and return the div element.  
The API is quite similar to the web API except for the fact that the method names  
are using snake case instead of camel case.  
We will change index.js to use this element as a web component\:  
import\("./web\_sys\_api"\).then\(module =\> \{  
class Pie extends HTMLElement \{  
constructor\(\) \{  
super\(\);  
let shadow = this.attachShadow\(\{ mode\:  
'open' \}\);  
let style =  
document.createElement\('style'\);  
style.textContent = \`  
svg \{  
width\:100px;  
height\: 100px;  
background\: yellowgreen;  
border-radius\: 50%;  
\} 184 Crossing the Boundary between Rust and WebAssembly  
circle \{  
fill\: yellowgreen;  
stroke\: \#655;  
stroke-width\: 32;  
\}\`;  
shadow.appendChild\(module.draw\(this.  
getAttribute  
\('value'\)\);  
shadow.appendChild\(style\);  
\}  
\}  
customElements.define\('pie-chart', Pie\);  
setInterval\(\(\) =\> \{  
let r = Math.floor\(Math.random\(\) \* 100\);  
document.getElementsByTagName\('body'\)\[0\].  
innerHTML = \`  
\<pie-chart value='\$\{r\}' /\>\`;  
\}, 1000\);  
\}\);  
5\. So, what have we done here? We first imported the binding file, which will, in turn,  
initialize the WebAssembly module. Once the WebAssembly module is initialized,  
we create a Pie class that extends the HTML element. Inside the class' constructor,  
we call the super method. Then, we create a shadow DOM. We add a style element  
to the shadow DOM, and then define the style for the element.  
We go on to append the style element to the shadow element, and then add the  
element that is exported from the Rust code. We then register it as a custom element  
named pie-chart. Finally, we append the custom element to our document's  
body to see the pie chart getting displayed.  
Now, run the following command\:  
\$ npm run serve  
Open the browser to see the pie chart. Summary 185  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we saw how wasm-bindgen makes it easy to share complex objects  
between JavaScript and Rust. The annotations make it easy to mark a function to export/  
import between JavaScript and WebAssembly. We also saw how js-sys and web-sys Cargo  
make it easier to call JavaScript and web APIs inside Rust code easily.  
In the next chapter, we will see how to optimize the generated WebAssembly module  
in Rust. 10  
# Optimizing Rust and  
# WebAssembly  
So far, we have seen how Rust makes it easy to create and run WebAssembly modules and  
various tools provided by the Rust community. We will cover the following sections in this  
chapter\:

# Technical requirements  
You can find the code files present in this chapter on GitHub at https\://github.  
com/PacktPublishing/Practical-WebAssembly. 188 Optimizing Rust and WebAssembly  
# Minimizing the WebAssembly modules  
wasm-bindgen is a complete suite that generates the binding JavaScript file \(along  
with polyfills\) for the WebAssembly module. In previous chapters, we saw how wasm-  
bindgen provides libraries and makes it easy to pass complex objects between JavaScript  
and WebAssembly. But in the WebAssembly world, it is important to optimize the  
generated binary for size and performance.  
Let's see how we can further optimize the WebAssembly modules\:  
1\. Create a WebAssembly application with all the necessary toolchains\:  
\$ npm init rust-webpack wasm-rust  
🦀 Rust + 🕸 WebAssembly + Webpack = ❤  
2\. This previous command creates a new Rust and JavaScript-based application with  
webpack as the bundler.  
Go into the generated wasm-rust directory\:  
cd wasm-rust  
3\. The Rust source files are present in the src directory and the JavaScript files  
are available in the js directory. We have webpack configured for running the  
application.  
Remove all the code from src/lib.rs and replace it with the following\:  
use wasm\_bindgen\:\:prelude\:\:\*;  
\#\[cfg\(feature = "wee\_alloc"\)\]  
\#\[global\_allocator\]  
static ALLOC\: wee\_alloc\:\:WeeAlloc =  
wee\_alloc\:\:WeeAlloc\:\:INIT;  
\#\[wasm\_bindgen\]  
pub fn is\_palindrome\(input\: &str\) -\> bool \{  
let s = input.to\_string\(\).to\_lowercase\(\);  
s == s.chars\(\).rev\(\).collect\:\:\<String\>\(\)  
\}  
We import wasm\_bindgen and then enable wee\_alloc, which does a much  
smaller memory allocation. 4\. 5. Minimizing the WebAssembly modules 189  
We go on to define the is\_palindrome function, which takes &str as input  
and returns bool. Inside this function, we check whether the given string is a  
palindrome or not.  
Note  
Find out more about the difference between &str and String  
at https\://users.rust-lang.org/t/whats-the-  
difference-between-string-and-str/10177/9.  
Now, remove all the lines from js/index.js and replace them with the following  
content\:  
const rust = import\('../pkg/index.js'\);  
rust.then\(module =\> \{  
console.log\(module.is\_palindrome\('tattarrattat'\)\);  
// returns true  
\}\);  
Note  
We are importing from ../pkg/index.js here. The wasm-pack  
command will generate the binding file and wasm file inside the pkg  
folder.  
Next, build the application with the following command\:  
\$ npm run build  
// comments, logs are elided  
Asset Size Chunks Chunk Names  
0.js 9.84 KiB 0 \[emitted\]  
0fd5cbc32a547ac3295c.module.wasm 115 KiB 0  
\[emitted\] \[immutable\]  
index.html 179 bytes \[emitted\]  
index.js 901 KiB index \[emitted\]  
index  
You can run the application with the npm run start command. This command  
opens the browser and loads the application. 190 Optimizing Rust and WebAssembly  
6\. 7. Now, open the developer tools and check the logs in the console.  
The WebAssembly module generated by the Rust compiler is not completely  
optimized. We can optimize the WebAssembly modules further. In the JavaScript  
world, every byte matters.  
Now, open Cargo.toml and add the following content\:  
\[profile.dev\]  
opt-level = 'z'  
lto = true  
debug = false  
Also, remove the \[profile.release\] section completely. The \[profile.  
dev\] section instructs the compiler on how to profile the code generated in the dev  
build. The \[profile.release\] section is used only for the release build.  
We instruct the compiler to use opt-level = z for generating the code. The  
opt-level setting is similar to the LLVM compiler's -O1/2/3/....  
The valid options of the opt-level setting are as follows\:  
 0 – no optimizations; also turns on cfg\(debug\_assertions\)  
 1 – basic optimizations  
 2 – some optimizations  
 3 – all optimizations  
 s – optimize for binary size  
 z – optimize for binary size, but also turn off loop vectorization  
LLVM supports link-time optimizations to better optimize code by using whole  
program analysis. But link-time optimization comes at the cost of longer linking  
time. We can enable LLVMs link-time optimization using the lto option.  
The lto supports the following options\:  
 false – performs "thin local LTO”. This means the link-time optimizations are  
done only on the local crate. Note\: there will not be any link-time optimizations  
when the number of Codegen units is 1 or opt-level is 0.  
 true or "fat" – performs "fat" LTO. This means the link-time optimizations are  
done across all crates in the dependency graph. Minimizing the WebAssembly modules 191  
 thin – performs "thin" LTO. This is a faster version of “fat”, that optimizes at a  
faster rate.  
 off – disables LTO.  
8\. Next, run npm run build\:  
\$ npm run build  
// comments, logs are elided  
Asset Size Chunks Chunk Names  
0.js 9.84 KiB 0 \[emitted\]  
b5e867dd3d25627d7122.module.wasm 50.8 KiB 0  
\[emitted\] \[immutable\]  
index.js 901 KiB index \[emitted\]  
index  
The generated WebAssembly binary is 50.8 KB. The generated binary is \~44%  
smaller in size. That is a huge win for us. We can further optimize the binary using  
Binaryen's wasm-opt tool\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/binaryen/wasm-opt -Oz  
b5e867dd3d25627d7122.module.wasm -o opt-gen.wasm  
\$ l  
-rw-r--r-- 1 sendilkumar staff 45K May 8 17\:43  
opt-gen.wasm  
It reduces another 5 KB. We have used the -Oz pass, but we can pass in other passes  
to further optimize the generated binary.  
We have seen how to minimize the WebAssembly module using Rust. Next, we will  
analyze the memory model in the WebAssembly module. 192 Optimizing Rust and WebAssembly  
# Analyzing the memory model in the  
# WebAssembly module  
Inside the JavaScript engine, WebAssembly and JavaScript run at different locations.  
Crossing the boundaries between JavaScript and WebAssembly will always have a cost  
attached to it. The browser vendors implemented cool hacks and workarounds to reduce  
this cost, but when your applications cross this boundary, this boundary crossing will  
often soon become a major performance bottleneck for your application. It is very  
important to design WebAssembly applications in a way that reduces boundary crossing.  
But once the application grows, it becomes difficult to manage this boundary crossing. To  
prevent boundary crossing, WebAssembly modules come with the memory module.  
The memory section in the WebAssembly module is a vector of linear memories.  
A linear memory model is a memory-addressing technique in which the memory is  
organized in a single contagious address space. It is also known as the Flat memory model.  
The linear memory model makes it easier to understand, program, and represent the  
memory. But it also has huge disadvantages, such as high execution time for rearranging  
elements in memory and wasting a lot of memory area.  
Here, the memory represents a vector of raw bytes containing uninterpreted data.  
WebAssembly uses resizable array buffers to hold the raw bytes of memory. It is important  
to note that this memory that is created is accessible and mutable from both JavaScript  
and WebAssembly.  
# Sharing memory between JavaScript and  
# WebAssembly using Rust  
We have already seen how to share the memory between JavaScript and WebAssembly.  
Let's share memory using Rust in this example\:  
1\. Create a new Rust project using Cargo\:  
\$ cargo new --lib memory\_world  
2\. Open the project in your favorite editor and replace src/lib.rs with the  
following content\:  
\#!\[no\_std\]  
use core\:\:panic\:\:PanicInfo;  
use core\:\:slice\:\:from\_raw\_parts\_mut; Analyzing the memory model in the WebAssembly module 193  
\#\[no\_mangle\]  
fn memory\_to\_js\(\) \{  
let obj\: &mut \[u8\];  
unsafe \{  
obj = from\_raw\_parts\_mut\:\:\<u8\>\(0 as \*mut u8, 1\);  
\}  
obj\[0\] = 13;  
\}  
\#\[panic\_handler\]  
fn panic\(\_info\: &PanicInfo\) -\> !\{  
loop\{\}  
\}  
3\. The Rust file starts with \#!\[no\_std\]. This instructs the compiler not to include  
the Rust Standard Library while generating the WebAssembly module. This will  
reduce the binary size a lot. Next, we define a function called memory\_to\_js. This  
function creates an obj in memory and shares it with JavaScript. In the function  
definition, we create a slice of u32 called obj. Next, we assign some raw memory  
to obj. Here, we are dealing with raw memory. Hence, we wrap the code inside an  
unsafe block. The memory object is global and it is mutable by both JavaScript  
and WebAssembly. Hence, we use from\_raw\_parts\_mut to instantiate the  
object. Finally, we assign a value to the first element in the shared array buffer.  
Create an index.html file and add the following content\:  
\<script\>  
\( async\(\) =\> \{  
const bytes = await fetch\("target/wasm32-  
unknown-unknown/debug/memory\_world.wasm"\);  
const response = await bytes.arrayBuffer\(\);  
const result = await  
WebAssembly.instantiate\(response, \{\}\);  
result.exports.memory\_to\_js\(\);  
const memObj = new  
UInt8Array\(result.exports.memory.buffer, 0\) 194 Optimizing Rust and WebAssembly  
.slice\(0, 1\);  
console.log\(memObj\[0\]\); // 13  
\}\)\(\);  
\</script\>  
We create an anonymous asynchronous JavaScript function that will be invoked  
as soon as the script is loaded. We fetch the WebAssembly binary inside the  
anonymous function. Next, we create ArrayBuffer and instantiate the module to  
the result object. We then call the memory\_to\_js method in the WebAssembly  
module \(note the exports keyword, since the function is exported from the  
WebAssembly module\). This instantiates the memory and assigns the first element  
in the shared array buffer to 13\:  
const memObj = new  
UInt8Array\(result.exports.memory.buffer, 0\)  
.slice\(0, 1\);  
console.log\(memObj\[0\]\); // 13  
Next, we call the memory object that is exported from WebAssembly using result.  
export.memory.buffer and convert it into UInt8Array using a new  
UInt8Array\(\). Next, we extract the first element using slice\(0,1\). This way, we  
can pass and retrieve values between JavaScript and WebAssembly without any overhead.  
The memory is accessed via load and store binary instructions. The load operation  
copies data from the main memory to register. The store operation copies data from the  
main memory. These binary instructions are accessed with the offset and the alignment.  
The alignment is in base-2 logarithmic representation. The memory address should be a  
multiple of four. This is called alignment restriction. This alignment restriction makes the  
hardware much faster.  
Note  
It is important to note that WebAssembly currently provides only a 32-bit  
address range. In the future, WebAssembly might provide a 64-bit address  
range.  
We have seen how to share memory between JavaScript and WebAssembly by creating the  
memory in Rust. Next, we will create a memory object on the JavaScript side and use it  
inside the Rust application. Analyzing the memory model in the WebAssembly module 195  
# Creating a memory object in JavaScript to use in the  
# Rust application  
Unlike JavaScript, Rust is not dynamically typed. The memory created in JavaScript has  
no way to tell WebAssembly \(or the Rust code\) what to allocate and when to free them.  
We need to explicitly inform WebAssembly how to allocate the memory and, most  
importantly, when and how to free them \(to avoid any leaks\).  
We use the WebAssembly.memory\(\) constructor to create the memory in JavaScript.  
The memory constructor takes in an object to set the defaults. The object has the following  
options\:  
•  
•  
•  
initial – the initial size of the memory  
maximum – the maximum size of the memory \(optional\)  
shared – to denote whether to use the shared memory  
The units for initial and maximum are WebAssembly pages, where a page refers to  
64 KB.  
We change the HTML file as follows\:  
\<script\>  
\( async\(\) =\> \{  
const memory = new WebAssembly.Memory\(\{initial\: 10,  
maximum\:100\}\); // -\> 1  
const bytes = await fetch\("target/wasm32-unknown-  
unknown/debug/memory\_world.wasm"\);  
const response = await bytes.arrayBuffer\(\);  
const instance = await  
WebAssembly.instantiate\(response,  
\{ js\: \{ mem\: memory \} \}\); // -\>2  
const s = new Set\(\[1, 2, 3\]\);  
let jsArr = Uint8Array.from\(s\); // -\> 3  
const len = jsArr.length;  
let wasmArrPtr = instance.exports.malloc\(length\);  
// -\> 4  
let wasmArr = new  
Uint8Array\(instance.exports.memory.buffer,  
wasmArrPtr, len\); // -\> 5 196 Optimizing Rust and WebAssembly  
wasmArr.set\(jsArr\); // -\> 6  
const sum = instance.exports.accumulate  
\(wasmArrPtr, len\); // -\> 7  
console.log\(sum\);  
\}\)\(\);  
\</script\>  
In // -\> 1, the memory is initialized with the WebAssembly.Memory\(\) constructor.  
We passed in the initial and maximum size of the memory, that is, 640 KB and 6.4 MB,  
respectively.  
In // -\> 2, we're instantiating the WebAssembly module along with the memory object.  
In // -\> 3, we then create typedArray \(UInt8Array\) with values 1, 2, and 3.  
In // -\> 4, we see how, as WebAssembly modules do not have any clue about the  
objects that are created out of the memory, the memory needs to be allocated. We have  
to manually write the allocation and freeing of memory in WebAssembly. In this step,  
we send the length of the array and allocate that memory. This gives us a pointer to the  
location of the memory.  
In // -\> 5, we create a new typedArray with the buffer \(total available memory\), the  
memory offset \(wasmAttrPtr\), and the length of the memory.  
In // -\> 6, we set the locally created typedArray \(in step 3\) to typedArray created  
in step 5.  
In //-\> 7, finally, we send the pointer to the memory and the length to the  
WebAssembly module, where we fetch the value from the memory by using the pointer to  
the memory and the length.  
On the Rust side, replace the contents of src/lib.rs with the following\:  
use std\:\:alloc\:\:\{alloc, dealloc, Layout\};  
use std\:\:mem;  
\#\[no\_mangle\]  
fn accumulate\(data\: \*mut u8, len\: usize\) -\> i32 \{  
let y = unsafe \{ std\:\:slice\:\:from\_raw\_parts\(data as  
\*const u8, len\) \};  
let mut sum = 0;  
for i in 0..len \{  
sum = sum + y\[i\]; Analyzing the memory model in the WebAssembly module 197  
\}  
sum as i32  
\}  
\#\[no\_mangle\]  
fn malloc\(size\: usize\) -\> \*mut u8 \{  
let align = std\:\:mem\:\:align\_of\:\:\<usize\>\(\);  
if let Ok\(layout\) = Layout\:\:from\_size\_align\(size,  
align\) \{  
unsafe \{  
if layout.size\(\) \> 0 \{  
let ptr = alloc\(layout\);  
if !ptr.is\_null\(\) \{  
return ptr  
\}  
\} else \{  
return align as \*mut u8  
\}  
\}  
\}  
std\:\:process\:\:abort  
\}  
We imported alloc, dealloc, and Layout from std\:\:alloc and std\:\:mem to  
play with the raw memory. The first function, accumulate, takes in data, which is  
the pointer where the data starts, and len, the length of the memory to read. First, we  
create a slice from the raw memory using std\:\:slice\:\:from\_raw\_parts by passing  
the pointer, data, and length, len. Note that this is an unsafe operation. Next, we run  
through the items in the array and add all the elements. Finally, we return the value as  
i32.  
The malloc function is used to custom-allocate the memory since the WebAssembly  
module has no clue about the type of information sent and how to read/understand it.  
malloc helps us to allocate the memory as required without any panic.

# Analyzing the WebAssembly module  
# with Twiggy  
The Rust-to-WebAssembly binaries are more likely to create a bloated binary. Proper care  
should be taken when creating WebAssembly binaries. The trade-off between the level of  
optimization, the time to compile, and various other factors should be considered while  
producing binaries. But most of the preceding work is done by the compiler by default.  
Either Emscripten or the rustc compiler ensures the elimination of dead code along  
with various options on the optimization level \(-O0 to z\). We can choose the one that  
fits us.  
Twiggy is a code size profiler. It uses the call graph to determine the origins of a function  
and provides meta-information about the function. The meta-information includes the  
size of each function in binary and its cost. Twiggy provides an overview of what is in the  
binary. With that information, we can optimize the binary further Let's install and use  
Twiggy to optimize the binary\:.  
1\. Install Twiggy by running the following command\:  
\$ cargo install twiggy  
2\. Once installed, the twiggy command will be available in the command line, which  
we can check with the following command\:  
\$ twiggy  
twiggy-opt 0.6.0  
...  
Use \`twiggy\` to make your binaries slim!  
USAGE\:  
twiggy \<SUBCOMMAND\>  
FLAGS\:  
-h, --help Prints help information  
-V, --version Prints version information  
SUBCOMMANDS\:  
diff Diff the old and new versions of a  
binary to see what sizes changed.  
dominators Compute and display the dominator 3\. 4. 5. Analyzing the WebAssembly module with Twiggy 199  
tree for a binary's call graph.  
garbage Find and display code and data that  
is not transitively referenced by any  
exports or public functions.  
help Prints this message or the help of  
the given subcommand\(s\)  
monos List the generic function  
monomorphizations that are  
contributing to code bloat.  
paths Find and display the call paths  
to a function in the given binary's  
call graph.  
top List the top code size offenders in a  
binary.  
Create a folder to test-drive Twiggy\:  
\$ mkdir twiggy-world  
Create a file called add.wat and add the following content\:  
\$ touch add.wat  
\(module  
\(func \$add \(param \$lhs i32\) \(param \$rhs i32\)  
\(result i32\)  
get\_local \$lhs  
get\_local \$rhs  
i32.add\)  
\(export "add" \(func \$add\)\)  
\)  
Once you have defined the WebAssembly text format, compile it to the  
WebAssembly module using wabt\:  
\$ /path/to/build/directory/of/wabt/wat2wasm add.wat 200 Optimizing Rust and WebAssembly  
6\. The preceding command generates an add.wasm file. To get the call paths in the  
binary, run Twiggy with the paths option\:  
\$ twiggy paths add.wasm  
Shallow Bytes │ Shallow % │ Retaining Paths  
───────────────┼───────────┼───────────────────────────  
9 ┊ 21.95% ┊ code\[0\]  
┊ ┊ ⬑ export "add"  
8 ┊ 19.51% ┊ wasm magic bytes  
6 ┊ 14.63% ┊ type\[0\]\: \(i32, i32\) -\> i32  
┊ ┊ ⬑ code\[0\]  
┊ ┊ ⬑ export "add"

6 ┊ 14.63% ┊ code section headers  
3 ┊ 7.32% ┊ type section headers  
3 ┊ 7.32% ┊ export section headers  
The twiggy paths command shows the call path for the functions, the number of bytes  
they occupy inside the binary, and their percentage. The actual added code is 9 bytes and  
it occupies 21.95% of the total binary size.  
Let's explore various subcommands in Twiggy\:  
•  
top  
•  
monos  
•  
garbage  
# top  
The twiggy top command will list the code size of each block. It lists, in descending  
order, the size of the function, the percentage of the size in the end binary and the block  
section\:  
\$ twiggy top add.wasm  
Shallow Bytes │ Shallow % │ Item  
───────────────┼───────────┼───────────────────────────  
9 ┊ 21.95% ┊ code\[0\]  
8 ┊ 19.51% ┊ wasm magic bytes  
6 ┊ 14.63% ┊ type\[0\]\: \(i32, i32\) -\> i32 Analyzing the WebAssembly module with Twiggy 201  
6 ┊ 14.63% ┊ export "add"  
6 ┊ 14.63% ┊ code section headers  
3 ┊ 7.32% ┊ type section headers  
3 ┊ 7.32% ┊ export section headers  
41 ┊ 100.00% ┊ Σ \[7 Total Rows\]  
The usage of the twiggy top is as follows  
USAGE\: twiggy top \<input\> -n \<max\_items\> -o  
\<output\_destination\> --format \<output\_format\> --mode  
\<parse\_mode\>  
List the top n details using -n followed by the number of entries to show\:  
\$ twiggy top add.wasm -n 3  
Shallow Bytes │ Shallow % │ Item  
───────────────┼───────────┼───────────────────────────  
9 ┊ 21.95% ┊ code\[0\]  
8 ┊ 19.51% ┊ wasm magic bytes  
6 ┊ 14.63% ┊ type\[0\]\: \(i32, i32\) -\> i32  
18 ┊ 43.90% ┊ ... and 4 more.  
41 ┊ 100.00% ┊ Σ \[7 Total Rows\]  
Similarly, we can format the output to JSON format using the --format flag\:  
\$ twiggy top add.wasm -n 3 --format json  
\[\{"name"\:"code\[0\]","shallow\_size"\:9,"shallow\_size\_percent"\:  
21.951219512195124\},\{"name"\:"wasm magic  
bytes","shallow\_size"\:8,"shallow\_size\_percent"\:19.512195121  
95122\},\{"name"\:"type\[0\]\: \(i32, i32\) -\>  
i32","shallow\_size"\:6,"shallow\_size\_percent"\:14.63414634146  
3413\}\]  
The top command is extremely useful when you want to track down the biggest code  
blocks and then optimize them separately. 202 Optimizing Rust and WebAssembly  
# monos  
In the JavaScript world, monomorphization increases performance. But it also bloats  
the code size \(for example, in generics\). Since we have to create the implementation of  
a generic function dynamically for every type, we have to be very careful when using  
generics and monomorphic code.  
Twiggy has a subcommand called monos that will list the code bloating due to  
monomorphization\:  
\$ twiggy monos pkg/index\_bg.wasm  
Apprx. Bloat Bytes │ Apprx. Bloat % │ Bytes │ % │

We are using the index\_bg.wasm example from the Minimizing the WebAssembly  
modules section of this chapter.  
monos is extremely useful for us to understand the occurrence of any bloating caused by  
generic parameters, which can then be changed to a simpler function with generics.  
# garbage  
At times, it is important to find code that is not used anymore but is kept in the final  
binary due to some other reasons. These functions are referenced somewhere but not used  
anywhere and the compiler will not know when and where to remove them. 204 Optimizing Rust and WebAssembly  
We can use Twiggy's garbage command to list all the code and data that is not  
transitively referenced\:  
\$ twiggy garbage add.wasm  
Bytes │ Size % │ Garbage Item  
───────┼────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────  
109 ┊ 0.21% ┊ custom section 'producers'  
109 ┊ 0.21% ┊ Σ \[1 Total Rows\]  
27818 ┊ 53.44% ┊ 1 potential false-positive data segments  
WebAssembly modules consist of a data section. But sometimes, we might not use the  
data straight away in the WebAssembly module but in some other places where it is  
imported. As you can see here, Twiggy's garbage subcommand shows those potentially  
false values.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we have seen how to optimize the WebAssembly binary using Rust, how  
to map memory between JavaScript and Rust, and finally, how to analyze a WebAssembly  
module using Twiggy.  
The WebAssembly ecosystem is still in its early days and it promises better performance.  
The WebAssembly binary addresses a few gaps in the JavaScript ecosystem, such as  
size-efficient compact binaries, enabling streaming compilation, and properly typed  
binaries. These features make WebAssembly smaller and faster. Rust, on the other  
hand, provides first-in-class support for generating a WebAssembly module and  
wasm-bindgen is the best tool available that makes it easier to transfer complex objects  
in Rust and WebAssembly.  
I hope that you now understand the basics of WebAssembly and how Rust makes it easier  
to generate WebAssembly modules. I can't wait to see what you will be shipping with Rust  
and WebAssembly. Symbols
