624 **Preface**  
Revenue management \(RM\) has gained attention recently as one of  
the most successful application areas of operations research \(OR\). The  
practice has grown from its origins as a relatively obscure practice among  
a handful of major airlines in the post-deregulation era in the U.S. \(circa  
1978\) to its status today as a mainstream business practice with a grow-  
ing list of industry users from Walt Disney Resorts to National Car  
Rental and a supporting industry of software and consulting firms. Ma-  
jor airlines‚ hotel chains‚ and car rental companies have large staffs of  
developers and analysts working on RM‚ and major consulting and soft-  
ware firms also employ large numbers of RM professionals.  
There are now several major industry RM conferences each year\: The  
Airline Group of the International Federation of Operational Research  
Societies \(AGIFORS\) sponsors an annual reservation and yield manage-  
ment conference that attracts has attracted up to 200 professionals‚ and  
The International Air Travel Association \(IATA\) hosts an annual RM  
conference that has drawn up to 800 attendees in recent years. The  
Professional Pricing Society also hosts professional conferences that ad-  
dress science-based pricing methods and technologies and general pricing  
strategy.  
Over this same period‚ academic and industry research on the method-  
ology of RM has also grown rapidly. The number of published papers  
on RM has increased dramatically in the last ten years. INFORMS‚ the  
leading professional society of OR‚ has started a Pricing and RM Section‚  
which has now hosted several annual conferences on RM‚ each drawing  
in excess of 100 researchers and professionals. And several universities  
now offer specialized RM courses‚ at both the M.B.A and Ph.D. levels.  
Despite this explosion of both professional and scholarly activity‚ no  
book has comprehensively covered the field of RM. For any area in such  
a mature state of development and with such widespread industry usage‚ xxvi *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
such a reference is desirable. However‚ for RM the need is particularly  
acute for several reasons\:  
RM is very much a professional practice and as such there is a con-  
siderable amount of “institutional” knowledge surrounding it that is  
relatively inaccessible to those outside the profession.  
Many of the early and even some more recent seminal ideas do not  
appear in published journals. Even those that have been published  
sometimes appear in relatively obscure sources such as AGIFORS  
proceedings‚ industry newsletters‚ and standard industry practice.  
The terminology‚ concepts‚ and notation have not been standardized  
to date‚ so it is often confusing for an outsider to reconcile the various  
contributions of the extant literature.  
There is often a considerable gap between practitioners and acad-  
emics in the field. Academics are often not aware of the real world  
complexities faced by practitioners of RM‚ and industry practition-  
ers are often not aware of the more recent advances in the academic  
literature.  
Our aim in writing this book is to meet this need. The book seeks—  
as its title indicates—to cover both the *theory* and the *practice* of RM.  
Fundamentally‚ RM is an applied discipline; its value and significance  
ultimately derive from the business results it achieves. At the same  
time it has strong elements of an applied science‚ and the technical  
elements of the subject deserve rigorous treatment. Both these practical  
and theoretical elements of the field reinforce each other‚ and to a large  
extent this is what makes the topic exciting. It is this constructive  
interplay of theory and practice that we have strived to capture in this  
book.  
# Audience  
We have two primary audiences in mind for this book—\(1\) analytically  
trained \(or at least “analytically tolerant”\) practitioners in industry and  
\(2\) academic researchers and teachers. We view our core reader as some-  
one who has the equivalent of a master’s degree or higher in a technical  
subject such as engineering‚ operations research‚ statistics‚ or economics.  
However‚ significant portions of the text are accessible to general or  
business readers‚ particularly the introduction‚ Chapter 10 on indus-  
try profiles‚ and Chapter 11 on implementation issues. In addition‚ the  
introductions to the technical chapters provide high-level overviews of *PREFACE* xxvii  
each chapter‚ which are designed to provide a qualitative understand-  
ing of the main topics covered and their business context‚ and give the  
reader a sense of the essence—if not the details—of the material.  
For experienced practitioners this book serves as a single-source ref-  
erence for the major theory and application issues involved in RM. The  
key technical results in the field are organized and presented precisely  
and in consistent notation‚ so that practitioners can easily refer to rele-  
vant models‚ formulas‚ and algorithms as needed. For new employees in  
the RM industry our book also serves as a useful primer on the subject‚  
allowing them to “get up to speed” on the details of the field quickly  
through a consistent presentation of the material. For the technically  
oriented user it serves as an unbiased‚ noncommercial source for un-  
derstanding the competing methodologies available for RM and their  
relative strengths and weaknesses.  
We view the academic audience for the book as consisting of the many  
researchers now working on various RM-related topics‚ as well as those  
who work in related areas \(such as supply-chain management\)‚ who may  
want a single-source‚ accessible overview of the main theory and practice  
components of the field. Academics who teach management science or  
operations management courses may also find the book useful‚ either  
directly as a supplementary text or simply for the instructor’s personal  
use as a reference on the subject. Our experiences with colleagues outside  
the field has suggested that most are curious about RM but perhaps not  
confident enough about the theory and practice to introduce the subject  
in their classes. This book should help “demystify” the subject for them.  
Finally‚ a growing number of courses have specifically focused on RM.  
Though not designed particularly as a textbook‚ the book should serve as  
a useful reading and reference in such courses. While we have not put in  
homework exercises‚ we did include many small‚ technically uncluttered  
examples throughout the book that illustrate the core concepts being  
discussed.  
We forewarn the reader that the material in some places in the book  
has an airline bias. This is as it should be in our opinion; airline RM  
practice remains an important topic in its own right. In addition‚ a large  
number—indeed the vast majority—of RM practitioners and researchers  
working in the field today are involved directly in airline RM practices.  
So airline RM is deserving of rigorous and careful coverage‚ which is one  
of our goals in writing this book.  
At the same time‚ not every industry is like the airline industry and  
“airlinelike” conditions are not‚ in our view‚ that necessary to apply  
RM ideas. Therefore‚ we have attempted to present RM in as generic  
terms as possible and included several topics and chapters that generalize xxviii *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
beyond the airline industry. We have tried to be somewhat forward  
looking in this regard‚ while at the same time not venturing too far into  
the realm of pure speculation.  
# Content and Style  
As for the choices of material‚ we have aimed for an applied technical  
\(engineering\) level in our treatment of the subject. For example‚ we have  
chosen to present all problems in discrete time. This eliminates several  
technical complications‚ while still allowing us to address a wide range  
of problems in a simple‚ yet rigorous way. Moreover‚ continuous-time  
models and methods are not frequently used in practice‚ so the focus on  
discrete-time methods is well justified from a practical standpoint.  
Similarly‚ we have not included a large number of proofs. This is  
both consistent with the applied orientation of the field and reflects our  
view that RM models and theory do not share enough in common to  
justify a highly formalistic‚ deductive approach to the subject. In a  
few cases we provide proofs of the theoretical results‚ but even these are  
relegated to appendices. When proofs are omitted‚ we provide references  
to the original sources and if possible give either informal arguments or  
intuition about the results.  
In addition‚ the bodies of each chapter do not contain a large number  
of literature references. This is because we want the reader to “see the  
material for what it is” and not be sidetracked by a lot of discussion of  
the literature. Where ideas are strongly associated with specific papers  
and people‚ we‚ of course‚ point this out. Detailed references to the  
literature and a discussion of sources are collected in a Notes and Sources  
section provided at the end of each chapter. To further assist the reader‚  
appendices containing basic results on probability theory‚ continuous  
optimization‚ dynamic programming‚ and game theory are provided to  
make the technical material in the book as self-contained as possible.  
We tried to be comprehensive in our coverage of RM‚ covering both  
quantity- and price-based RM as well as the supporting topics of fore-  
casting and economics. While we might have risked over-extending our-  
selves in this regard‚ we believe such a comprehensive approach is nec-  
essary to fully understand the subject. Indeed‚ a key contribution of the  
book is to unify the various forms of RM and to link them closely to  
each other and to the supporting fields of statistics and economics. The  
topics and coverage do‚ however‚ reflect our own personal choices about  
what is and is not important to understand RM. While we have tried to  
be as comprehensive‚ fair‚ and balanced as possible in arriving at these  
choices‚ undoubtedly our choices have resulted in some biases. However‚ *PREFACE* xxix  
the benefit to the reader is that the text has a point of view and is not  
merely an uncritical inventory of all research results to date in the field.  
Finally‚ we have also tried to come up with a notation that is generic  
and consistent across all the chapters. Much of this notation will not co-  
incide with the notation found in the original papers in the field‚ which  
is by and large quite inconsistent anyway. A summary of notation is  
provided in Appendix A for reference. The consistency of notation and  
presentation‚ we believe‚ makes reading the book much easier than look-  
ing at the corresponding collection of original-source articles‚ and it also  
highlights the connections among topics.This page intentionally left blank**Acknowledgments**

# INTRODUCTION  
This chapter provides an introduction to the topic of revenue man-  
agement \(RM\). We begin with an explanation of RM and its history  
and origins. We then provide a conceptual framework for understanding  
the objectives of RM, the types of business conditions under which it is  
applied, and the ways RM systems work. Finally we conclude by giving  
an outline of the remaining chapters of the book.  
**1.1 What Is “RM”?**  
Every seller of a product or service faces a number of fundamental  
decisions. A child selling lemonade outside her house has to decide on  
which day to have her sale, how much to ask for each cup, and when to  
drop the price \(if at all\) as the day rolls on. A homeowner selling a house  
must decide when to list it, what the asking price should be, which offer  
to accept, and when to lower the listing price—and by how much—if no  
offers come in. A stamp dealer selling on an Internet auction site has to  
select the duration of the auction, what reserve price to set \(if any\), and  
so on.  
And anyone who has ever faced such decisions knows the uncertainty  
involved. You want to sell at a time when market conditions are most  
favorable, but who knows what the future might hold? You want the  
price to be right—not so high that you put off potential buyers and not  
so low that you lose out on potential profits. You would like to know  
how much buyers value your product, but more often than not you must  
just guess at this number.  
Indeed, it is hard to find anyone who is entirely satisfied with their  
pricing and selling decisions. Even if you succeed in making a sale, 2 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
you often wonder whether you should have waited for a better offer or  
whether you accepted a price that was too low.  
Businesses face even more complex selling decisions. For example,  
how can a firm segment buyers by providing different conditions and  
terms of trade that profitably exploit their different buying behavior or  
willingness to pay? How can a firm design products to prevent cannibal–  
ization across segments and channels? Once it segments customers, what  
prices should it charge each segment? If the firm sells in different chan-  
nels, should it use the same price in each channel? How should prices be  
adjusted over time based on seasonal factors and the observed demand  
to date for each product? If a product is in short supply, to which seg-  
ments and channels should it allocate the products? How should a firm  
manage the pricing and allocation decisions for products that are com-  
plements \(seats on two connecting airline flights\) or substitutes \(different  
car categories for rentals\)?  
RM is concerned with such *demand-management* decisions1 and the  
methodology and systems required to make them. It involves managing  
the firm’s “interface with the market” as it were—with the objective  
of *increasing revenues.* RM can be thought of as the complement of  
*supply-chain management* \(SCM\), which addresses the *supply decisions*  
and processes of a firm, with the objective \(typically\) of *lowering the*  
*cost* of production and delivery.  
Other roughly synonymous names have been given to the practice  
over recent years—*yield management* \(the traditional airline term\), *pric-*  
*ing and revenue management, pricing and revenue optimization, revenue*  
*process optimization, demand management, demand-chain management*  
\(favored by those who want to create a practice parallel to supply-chain  
management\)—each with its own nuances of meaning and positioning.  
However, we use the more standard term revenue management to re-  
fer to the wide range of techniques, decisions, methods, processes, and  
technologies involved in demand management.  
**1.1.1 Demand-Management Decisions**  
RM addresses three basic categories of demand-management deci-  
sions\:  
1These can be referred to as either *sales decisions* \(we are making decisions on where and  
when to sell and to whom and at what price\) or *demand-management decisions* \(we are  
estimating demand and its characteristics and using price and capacity control to “manage”  
demand\). We use the latter consistently and use the shorter *demand management* whenever  
appropriate. *Introduction* 3  
Structural decisions\: Which selling format to use \(such as posted  
prices, negotiations or auctions\); which segmentation or differentia-  
tion mechanisms to use \(if any\); which terms of trade to offer \(in-  
cluding volume discounts and cancellation or refund options\); how to  
bundle products; and so on.  
Price decisions\: How to set posted prices, individual-offer prices, and  
reserve prices \(in auctions\); how to price across product categories;  
how to price over time; how to markdown \(discount\) over the product  
lifetime; and so on.  
Quantity decisions\: Whether to accept or reject an offer to buy;  
how to allocate output or capacity to different segments, products or  
channels; when to withhold a product from the market and sale at  
later points in time; and so on.  
Which of these decisions is most important in any given business de-  
pends on the context. The timescale of the decisions varies as well.  
Structural decisions about which mechanism to use for selling and how  
to segment and bundle products are normally strategic decisions taken  
relatively infrequently. Firms may also have to commit to certain price  
or quantity decisions, for example, by advertising prices in advance or  
deploying capacity in advance, which can limit their ability to adjust  
price or quantities on a tactical level. The ability to adjust quantities  
may also be a function of the technology of production—the flexibility of  
the supply process and the costs of reallocating capacity and inventory.  
For example, the use of capacity controls as a tactic in airlines stems  
largely from the fact that the different “products” an airline sells \(differ-  
ent ticket types sold at different times and under different terms\) are all  
supplied using the same, homogeneous seat capacity. This gives airlines  
tremendous quantity flexibility, so quantity control is a natural tactic in  
this industry. Retailers, in contrast, often commit to quantities \(initial  
stocking decisions\) but have more flexibility to adjust prices over time.  
The ability to price tactically, however, depends on how costly price  
changes are, which can vary depending on the channel of distribution  
such as online versus catalog.  
Whether a firm uses quantity or price-based RM controls varies even  
across firms within a given industry. For instance, while most airlines  
commit to fixed prices and tactically allocate capacity, low-cost carriers  
tend to use price as the primary tactical variable.  
Firms can also find innovative ways to increase their ability to make  
price or quantity recourse decisions. For example, retailers may hold  
back some stock in a centralized warehouse and then make a mid season 4 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
replenishment decision rather than precommit all their stock to stores  
up front. Some major airlines have experimented with movable parti-  
tions that allow them to reallocate seats from coach to business cabins  
on a short-term basis. And other major airlines have recently experi-  
mented with a practice called *demand-driven dispatch* in which  
aircraft of different sizes are dynamically assigned to each flight depar-  
ture in response to fluctuations in demand, and are not precommitted to  
flights \[50\]. Car rental companies also may reallocate their fleet from one  
city to another. In terms of pricing, using online channels or advertis-  
ing products without price \(“call for our low price”\) provides firms with  
more price flexibility. All these innovations increase the opportunity for  
quantity and price-based RM.  
Broadly speaking, RM addresses all three categories of demand-  
management decisions—structural, pricing, and quantity decisions. We  
qualify RM as being either *quantity-based RM* or *price-based RM* if it  
uses \(inventory- or\) capacity-allocation decisions or prices as the pri-  
mary tactical tool respectively for managing demand. Both the theory  
and practice of RM differ depending on which control variable is used,  
and hence we use this dichotomy as necessary.  
**1.1.2 What’s New About RM?**  
In one sense, RM is a very old idea. Every seller in human history has  
faced RM-type decisions. What price to ask? Which offers to accept?  
When to offer a lower price? And when to simply “pack up one’s tent”  
as it were and try selling at a later point in time or in a different market.  
In terms of business practice, the problems of RM are as old as business  
itself.  
In terms of theory, at a broad level the problems of RM are not new ei-  
ther. Indeed, the forces of supply and demand and the resulting process  
of price formation—the “invisible hand” of Adam Smith—lie at the heart  
of our current understanding of market economics. They are embodied  
in the concept of the “rational” \(profit-maximizing\) firm, and define the  
mechanisms by which market equilibria are reached. Modern economic  
theory addresses many advanced and subtle demand-management deci-  
sions, such as nonlinear pricing, bundling, segmentation, and optimizing  
in the presence of asymmetric information between buyers and sellers.  
What *is* new about RM is not the demand-management decisions  
themselves but rather *how* these decisions are made. The true inno-  
vation of RM lies in the *method* of decision making—a technologically  
sophisticated, detailed, and intensely operational approach to making  
demand-management decisions. *Introduction* 5  
This new approach is driven by two complementary forces. First,  
scientific advances in economics, statistics, and operations research now  
make it possible to model demand and economic conditions, quantify  
the uncertainties faced by decision makers, estimate and forecast market  
response, and compute optimal solutions to complex decision problems.  
Second, advances in information technology provide the capability to  
automate transactions, capture and store vast amounts of data, quickly  
execute complex algorithms, and then implement and manage highly  
detailed demand-management decisions. This combination of science  
and technology applied to age-old demand management is the hallmark  
of modern RM.  
And both the science and technology used in RM are quite new. Much  
of the science used in RM today \(demand models, forecasting methods,  
optimization algorithms\) is less than fifty years old, most of the infor-  
mation technology \(large databases, personal computers, Internet\) is  
less than twenty years old, and most of the software technology \(Java,  
object-oriented programming\) is less than five years old. Prior to these  
scientific developments, it would have been unthinkable to accurately  
model real world phenomena and demand-management decisions. With-  
out the information technology, it would be impossible to *operationalize*  
this science. These two capabilities *combined* make possible an entirely  
new approach to decision making—one that has profound consequences  
for demand management.  
The first consequence is that science and technology now make it  
possible to manage demand on a *scale and complexity* that would be un-  
thinkable through manual means \(or would require a veritable army of  
analysts to achieve\). A modern large airline, for example, can have thou-  
sands of flights a day and provide service between hundreds of thousands  
of origin-destination pairs, each of which is sold at dozens of prices—and  
this entire problem is replicated for hundreds of days into the future! A  
similar complexity is found at most large retail chains, which can have  
tens of thousand of SKUs2 sold in hundreds of stores and over the Web  
with prices monitored and updated on a daily basis. The sheer scale  
and complexity of the decision-making task in these cases is beyond the  
ability of human decision makers. And if not automated, the task has  
to be so highly aggregated and simplified that significant opportunities  
for incremental gains—on particular products, at particular locations,  
at specific points in time—are simply lost.  
2 A *SKU* \(stock-keeping unit\) is the lowest level at which we identify inventory—such as men’s  
Arrow blue Oxford shirts, long sleeves, size medium. 6 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The second consequence of science and technology is that they make  
it possible to improve the *quality* of demand-management decisions. The  
management tasks that are involved—quantifying the risks and rewards  
in making demand-management decisions under uncertainty; working  
through the often subtle economics of pricing; accurately interpreting  
market conditions and trends and reacting to this information with  
timely, accurate, and consistent real-time decisions; optimizing a com-  
plex objective function subject to many constraints and business rules—  
are tasks most humans, even with many years of experience, are sim-  
ply not good at. Models and systems are better at separating market  
signals from market noise, evaluating complex tradeoffs, and optimiz-  
ing and producing consistent decisions. The application of science and  
technology to demand decisions often produces an improvement in the  
quality of the decisions, resulting in a significant increase in revenues.  
Of course, even with the best science and technology, there will al-  
ways be decisions that are better left to human decision makers. Models  
can detect only what’s in the data. They cannot reason through the  
consequences of a demand shock, new technologies, a sudden shift in  
consumer preferences, or the surprise price war of a competitor. These  
higher-level analyses are best left to experienced, human analysts. Most  
RM systems recognize this fact and parse the decision-making task, with  
models and systems handling routine demand-management decisions on  
an automated basis and human analysts overseeing these decisions and  
intervening \(based on flags or alerts from the system\) when extraordi-  
nary conditions arise. Such man-machine interaction offers a firm the  
best of both human and automated decision making.  
The process of managing demand decisions with science and  
technology—implemented with disciplined processes and systems, and  
overseen by human analysts \(a sort of “industrialization” of the entire  
demand-management process\)—defines modern RM.  
**1.2 The Origins of RM**  
Where did RM come from? In short, the airline industry. There are  
few business practices whose origins are so intimately connected to a  
single industry. Here we briefly review the history of airline RM and  
then discuss the implications of this history for the field.  
**1.2.1 Airline History**  
The starting point for RM was the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.  
With this act, the U.S. Civil Aviation Board \(CAB\) loosened control of  
airline prices, which had been strictly regulated based on standardized *Introduction* 7  
price and profitability targets. Passage of the act led to rapid change  
and a rash of innovation in the industry. Established carriers were now  
free to change prices, schedules, and service without CAB approval.  
Large airlines accelerated their development of computerized reservation  
systems \(CRSs\) and global distribution systems \(GDSs\), and the CDS  
business became profitable in its own right. The majors developed hub-  
and-spoke networks, which allowed them to offer service in many more  
markets than was possible with point-to-point service but also made  
pricing and operations more complex.  
At the same time, new low-cost and charter airlines entered the mar-  
ket. Many of these upstarts—because of their lower labor costs, simpler  
\(point-to-point\) operations, and no-frills service—were able to profitably  
price much lower than the major airlines. These new entrants tapped  
into an entirely new and vast market for discretionary travel—families  
on a holiday, couples getting away for the weekend, college students vis-  
iting home—many of whom might otherwise have driven their cars or  
not traveled at all. It turned out \(quite surprisingly to some at the time\)  
that air travel was quite price elastic; with prices sufficiently low, people  
switched from driving to flying, and demand from this segment surged.  
The potential of this market was embodied in the rapid rise of People-  
Express, which started in 1981 with cost-efficient operations and fares  
50 to 70% lower than the major carriers. By 1984, its revenues were  
approaching \$1 billion, and for the year 1984 it posted a profit of \$60  
million, its highest profit ever \(Cross \[137\]\).  
While these developments resulted in a significant migration of price-  
sensitive discretionary travelers to the new, low-cost carriers, the major  
airlines had strengths that these new entrants lacked. They offered more  
frequent schedules, service to more city pairs and an established brand  
name and reputation. For many business travelers, schedule convenience  
and service was \(and still is\) more important than price, so the threat  
posed by low-cost airlines was less acute in the business-traveler segment  
of the market. Nevertheless, the cumulative losses in revenue from the  
shift in traffic were badly damaging the profits of major airlines.  
A strategy to recapture the leisure passenger was needed. Yet, for the  
majors, a head-to-head, across-the-board price war with the upstarts  
was deemed almost suicidal; with their much lower costs, airlines like  
PeopleExpress could earn a profit at the new low prices, while most  
majors would lose money at a staggering rate.  
Robert Crandall, American Airline’s vice president of marketing at the  
time, is widely credited with the breakthrough in solving this problem.  
He recognized that his airline was already producing seats at a marginal  
cost near zero because most of the costs of a flight \(capital costs, wages, 8 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
fuel\) are fixed. As a result, American could in fact afford to “compete  
on cost” with the upstarts using its surplus seats.  
However, two problems had to be solved to execute this strategy.  
First, American had to have some way of identifying the “surplus” seats  
on each flight. The scheme would not be profitable if a sale of a low-price  
seats displaced high-paying business customers.3 Second, they had to  
ensure that American’s business customers did not switch and buy the  
new low-price products it offered to discretionary, leisure customers.  
American solved these problems using a combination of *purchase re-*  
*strictions* and *capacity-controlled fares.* First, they designed discounts  
that had significant restrictions for purchase\: they had to be purchased  
30 days in advance of departure, were nonrefundable, and required a  
seven day minimum stay. These restrictions were designed to prevent  
most business travelers from utilizing the new low fares. At the same  
time, American limited the number of discount seats sold on each flight\:  
they *capacity-controlled* the fares. This combination provided the means  
to compete on price with the upstart airlines without damaging their  
core business-traveler revenues.  
The new pricing scheme was launched in 1978 as American Super-  
Saver Fares. The fares were quite successful at stemming the tide of  
defections of discretionary travelers to the low-cost airlines.  
Despite this initial success, American experienced some significant  
problems implementing its new strategy. Initially, American’s capacity  
controls were based on setting aside a fixed portion of seats on each  
flight for the new low-fare products. But as American gained experi-  
ence with its Super-Saver fares, it realized that not all flights were the  
same. Flights on different days and at different times had very different  
patterns of demand. Some had many excess seats and could profitably  
support a higher allocation of discount seats; others had sufficient de-  
mand for regular-priced seats and warranted very little if any allocation  
to the new, discounted products.  
American realized that a more intelligent approach was needed to  
realize the full potential of capacity-controlled discounts. It therefore  
embarked on the development of what became known as the *Dynamic*  
*Inventory Allocation and Maintenance Optimizer* system \(DINAMO\).  
These efforts on DINAMO represent, in many ways, the first large-scale  
RM system development in the industry. \(Though on a more modest  
scale, the capacity-control problem dates back to the mid-1970s, and  
other airlines and the Boeing Aircraft Company were experimenting with  
3As we show in the chapters that follow, a notion of this sort of *displacement cost* is central  
to the theory of RM. *Introduction* 9  
similar ideas at the time.\) The DINAMO system was large and complex  
and took several years to develop and refine.  
DINAMO was implemented in full in January 1985 along with a new  
fare program entitled Ultimate Super-Saver Fares, which matched or  
undercut the lowest discount fares available in every market American  
served.  
DINAMO made all this possible. American could now be much  
more aggressive on price. It could announce low fares that spanned  
a large swath of individual flights, confident in its capability to accu-  
rately capacity-control the discounts on each individual departure. If  
a rival airline advertised a special fare in one of American’s markets,  
American could immediately match the offer across the board, knowing  
that the DINAMO system would carefully control the availability of this  
fare on the thousands of departures affected by the price change. More-  
over, the competition could not observe American’s capacity controls  
unlike prices themselves, which, thanks to GDSs, instantly became pub-  
lic information. This feature of pricing aggressively and competitively  
at an aggregate, market level, while controlling capacity at a tactical,  
individual-departure level still characterizes the practice of RM in the  
airline industry today.  
The effect of this new capability was dramatic. PeopleExpress was  
especially hard hit as American repeatedly matched or beat their prices  
in every market it served. PeopleExpress’s annual profit fell from an  
all-time high in 1984 \(the year prior to implementation of DINAMO\)  
to a loss of over \$160 million by 1986 \(one year after DINAMO was  
implemented\). It soon went bankrupt as a result of mounting losses,  
and in September 1986 the company was sold to Continental Airlines.  
Donald Burr, CEO of PeopleExpress, summarized the reasons behind  
the company’s failure \[137\]\:  
We were a vibrant, profitable company from 1981 to 1985, and then we tipped  
right over into losing \$50 million a month. We were still the same company.  
What changed was American’s ability to do widespread Yield Management in  
every one of our markets. We had been profitable from the day we started  
until American came at us with Ultimate Super Savers. That was the end of  
our run because they were able to under-price us at will and surreptitiously.  
Obviously PeopleExpress failed … We did a lot of things right. But we didn’t  
get our hands around Yield Management and automation issues. … \[If I were  
to do it again,\] the number one priority on my list every day would be to see  
that my people got the best information technology tools. In my view, that’s  
what drives airline revenues today more than any other factor—more than  
service, more than planes, more than routes.” 10 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
This story was played out in similar fashion throughout the airline  
industry in the decades following deregulation. And airlines that did  
not have similar RM capabilities scrambled to get them.  
As a result of this history, the practice of RM in the airline industry  
today is both pervasive and mature, and RM is viewed as critical to  
running a modern airline profitably. For example, American Airlines’  
estimates that its RM practices generated \$1.4 billion in additional in-  
cremental revenue over a three-year period starting around 1988 \[477\].  
Many other carriers also attribute similar improvements in their revenue  
due to RM.  
**1.2.2 Consequences of the Airline History**  
The intimate connection of RM to the airline industry is both a bless-  
ing and a curse for the field of RM. The blessing is that RM can point  
to a major industry in which the practice of RM is pervasive, highly  
developed, and enormously effective. Indeed, a large, modern airline to-  
day would just not be able to operate profitably *without* RM. By most  
estimates, the revenue gains from the use of RM systems are roughly  
comparable to many airlines’ total profitability in a good year \(about  
4 to 5% of revenues\).4 And the scale and complexity of RM at ma-  
jor airlines is truly mind-boggling. Therefore, the airline success story  
validates both the economic importance of RM and the feasibility of  
executing it reliably in a complex business environment. This is the  
good-news story for the field from the airline experience.  
The bad news—the curse if you will—of the strong association of RM  
with airlines is that it has created a certain myopia inside the field.  
Many practitioners and researchers view RM solely in airline-specific  
terms, and this has at times tended to create biases that have hampered  
both research and implementation efforts in other industries.  
A second problem with the airline-specific association of RM is that  
airline pricing has something of a bad reputation among consumers.  
While on the one hand customers love the very low fares made possible by  
RM practices, the fact that fares are complex, are available one minute  
and gone the next, and can be drastically different for two people sitting  
side by side on the same flight, has led to a certain hostility toward  
the way airlines price. As a result, managers outside the industry are  
at times, quite naturally, somewhat reluctant to try RM practices for  
fear of engendering a similar hostile reaction among their customers.  
4 Many skeptics point to Southwest Airlines as a counterexample, but Southwest does use  
RM systems. However, because its pricing structure is simpler than most other airlines the  
use of RM is less obvious to consumers and casual observers. *Introduction* 11  
Yet the reality is that, in most cases, applying RM does *not* involve  
radically changing the structure of pricing and sales practices; rather, it  
is a matter of making more intelligent decisions.  
**1.3 A Conceptual Framework for RM**  
So if airlinelike conditions aren’t strictly necessary for RM, then ex-  
actly where *does* it apply? A short answer is\: in any business where  
tactical demand management is important and the technology and man-  
agement culture exists to implement it. But this in turn begs the ques-  
tion\: when do *these* conditions arise? To answer this question, it helps  
to begin with a conceptual framework for thinking about the demand  
management process.  
**1.3.1 The Multidimensional Nature of Demand**  
A firm’s demand has multiple dimensions, including \(1\) the different  
products it sells, \(2\) the types of customers it serves, their preferences for  
products, and their purchase behaviors, and \(3\) time. Other dimensions  
\(such as, locations or channels\) also affect the nature of a firm’s demand,  
but these three dimensions—products, customers, and time—suffice to  
illustrate the idea.  
Figure 1.1 shows these three demand dimensions. A single cell in the  
figure indicates a particular customer’s valuation for a particular product 12 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
at a particular point in time. RM addresses the structural, price, timing  
and quantity decisions a firm makes in trying to exploit the potential of  
this multidimensional demand landscape.  
For example, some RM problems look at exploiting heterogeneity in  
valuations among customers for a single product at a single point in  
time\: they fix the product and time dimension and try to optimize over  
the customer dimension. This problem is characteristic of the classi-  
cal auction-design problems discussed in Chapter 6 and classical price-  
discrimination problems discussed in Chapter 8. Other RM problems  
look at dynamically pricing a single product to heterogeneous customers  
over time\: they fix the product dimension and optimize over the cus-  
tomer and time dimensions. Such problems are addressed in Chapter 5.  
Others, such as the network problems in Chapter 3, address manag-  
ing demand decisions for multiple products over multiple time periods,  
and the customer-behavior dimension is not explicitly considered. Of  
course, all three dimensions are important factors in practice. However,  
methodologically one often has to decompose and simplify the problem  
to develop implementable solutions.  
**1.3.2 Linkages Among Demand-Management**  
# Decisions  
If the decisions affecting the demand landscape in Figure 1.1 were  
independent, then the decision-making problem would be considerably  
simpler. However, typically one or more of the following three factors  
link the demand across these dimensions.  
First, multiple products may share production capacity or have joint  
production costs. In such cases, the demand-management decision for  
different products or for a given product in different periods of time are  
interrelated. For example, because of joint capacity constraints, accept-  
ing demand from a customer for a particular product at a specific point  
in time may mean giving up opportunities to accept demand at later  
points in time, or because lowering the price of one product increases  
its demand, this may reduce the capacity available for producing other  
products.  
Second, even if production constraints do not link demand decisions,  
customer behavior often does. Customers may choose among substi-  
tute products at any given point in time, or customers may strategize  
over their timing in purchasing a given product. As a result, the price  
or quantity decisions that a firm makes about one product may affect  
demand for related products—or may affect the future demand for the  
same product. *Introduction* 13  
Finally, demand decisions for different products, customers, and time-  
periods may also be linked in terms of the information the firm gains.  
The most common link is over time; observed demand to date may reveal  
information about future demand. Thus, a decision about price today  
may affect the information we gain about demand sensitivity, which will  
affect future pricing decisions. Also, a firm selling the same product  
in geographically separated markets or in different channels may gain  
information in one location or channel as a result of observing demand  
that impacts its decisions in other locations and channels. Or the ob-  
served purchase decisions of a given customer may reveal information  
about that customer’s future purchase decisions. Such linkages com-  
plicate demand-management decisions, and managing the often subtle  
tradeoffs they create is a key motivation for RM.  
**1.3.3 Business Conditions Conducive to RM**  
Given this conceptualization of the demand-management problem,  
one can begin to gain insights into conditions in which RM is likely  
to be beneficial. Here, we discuss a few such conditions.  
**1.3.3.1 Customer Heterogeneity**  
If all customers value a product identically and exhibit similar pur-  
chase behavior, then the customer dimension of Figure 1.1 is essentially  
lost. As a result, there is less potential to exploit variations in willing-  
ness to pay, variations in preference for different products, and varia-  
tions of purchase behavior over time. Therefore, the more heterogeneity  
in customers, the more potential there is to exploit this heterogeneity  
strategically and tactically to improve revenues.  
Customers in the airline and hotel industries certainly exhibit this  
characteristic. They have widely varying patterns of usage and behavior  
in terms of when they purchase and how flexible their plans are, and  
they place very different valuations on the need to travel.  
**1.3.3.2 Demand Variability and Uncertainty**  
The more demand varies over time \(due to seasonalities, shocks and  
so on\) and the more uncertainty one has about future demand \(the more  
variance there is along the time dimension in Figure 1.1\) the more diffi-  
cult the demand-management decisions become. Hence, the potential to  
make bad decisions rises, and it becomes important to have sophisticated  
tools to evaluate the resulting complex tradeoffs. 14 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Consider the demand for air travel. It exhibits significant variations  
\(by season, time of day, day of week, holidays\) and even correcting for  
this predictable seasonal variation is highly uncertain for a given flight.  
**1.3.3.3 Production Inflexibility**  
As mentioned, joint production constraints and costs complicate the  
demand-management problem. If a firm can “absorb” variations in *de-*  
*mand* easily and costlessly through variations in *supply,* then the com-  
plexity of managing demand diminishes; you just supply enough to meet  
demand. However, the more inflexible the production—the more delays  
involved in producing units, the more fixed costs or economies of scale  
involved in production, the more the switch-over costs, the more capac-  
ity constraints—the more difficult or costly it becomes to match demand  
variations with supply variations. As a result, inflexibility leads to more  
interaction in the demand management at different points in time, be-  
tween different segments of customers, across different products of a  
product line, and across different channels of distribution \(the different  
cells in Figure 1.1\). The complexity increases and the consequences of  
poor decisions become more acute. Hence, RM becomes more beneficial.  
Again, the airline industry is one in which production is very inflexi-  
ble. Essentially, when committing to fly a flight from A to B, an airline  
both *fixes* the level of its output \(the number of seats\) and, for all prac-  
tical purposes, the total cost of that output—independent of how many  
customer actually fly on the flight. Its unit cost per seat sold, therefore,  
varies tremendously with the volume of sales, and once the capacity  
constraint is reached, no more production is possible. Worse yet, like  
all services, output cannot be inventoried, so production of air transport  
output in one period cannot be used to satisfy demand in later periods  
\(an unsold seat on Monday cannot be used to supply the need of an ex-  
cess passenger on Tuesday\). All these factors combine to create extreme  
inflexibility in the technology of air transport service, and this is one of  
the key driving factors in the importance of RM in this industry.  
**1.3.3.4 Price as a Signal of Quality**  
The extent to which price is a signal of quality is also a factor. For  
example, people buy a \$10,000 Patek Philippe watch partly for its aes-  
thetics and functionality but also, to a large extent, because they want  
the exclusivity of a \$10,000 watch. The price is a key feature of the  
watch, as it is with most luxury goods. They are status symbols, and to  
lower or manipulate the price risks damaging this status.  
A more subtle case is observed in situations where it is hard to assess  
quality through other, objective means. For example, the hourly rate *Introduction* 15  
of a prominent attorney or consultant, the tuition at an Ivy League  
university, and the price of a bottle of wine on a dinner menu—all play  
important roles as signals of quality to consumers. Again, tampering  
with prices for tactical reasons in such settings jeopardizes the signaling  
value of prices. Therefore, RM is more suited to products where price  
is *not* a status symbol and *not* a significant signal of value—where price  
and quality are decoupled in the consumer’s mind.  
Airlines are arguably a good example. While different airlines posi-  
tion themselves differently with respect to price and quality \(e.g., no-  
frills discount carriers and full-service, mainstream carriers\), consumers  
generally do not associate the price of an airline ticket with the quality  
of the particular flight. We do not expect a “nicer” flight when paying  
\$300 more because we booked our ticket at the last minute or because we  
booked our flight on a holiday weekend as opposed to a normal weekday.  
Moreover—despite what some airline marketers might like to believe—  
most consumer do not have strong quality preferences among airlines,  
at least not sufficient to outweigh even relatively small differences in  
schedule and price. This is one of the main motivations behind the  
introduction of loyalty schemes in the industry, which are really an at-  
tempt to “synthesize” a high level of brand loyalty among a group of  
consumers who innately have very little of it.  
**1.3.3.5 Data and Information Systems Infrastructure**  
To operationalize RM requires data to accurately characterize and  
model demand. It also requires systems to collect and store the data  
and to implement and monitor the resulting real-time decisions. In most  
industries it is usually feasible—in theory, at least—to collect and store  
demand data and automate demand decisions. However, attempting  
to apply RM in industries that do not have databases or transactions  
systems in place can be a time-consuming, expensive, and risky propo-  
sition. RM, therefore, tends to be more suited to industries where and  
transaction-processing systems are already employed as part of incum-  
bent business processes.  
Again, the airline industry is a perfect case in point. It is an industry  
whose pricing and distribution processes were largely automated with  
the introduction of GDSs in the 1960’s and 1970’s. In fact, it is one of  
the earliest industries to move almost entirely to electronic selling and  
distribution—decades before the advent of e-commerce. This long his-  
tory of using information systems to automate business processes meant  
that it was quite natural to implement RM in the airline industry when  
the time came. 16 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**1.3.3.6 Management Culture**  
RM is a technically complex and demanding practice. There is a risk,  
therefore, that a firm’s management may simply not have sufficient fa-  
miliarity with—or confidence in—science and technology to make imple-  
menting a RM system a realistic prospect. The culture of the firm may  
not be receptive to innovation or may value more intuitive approaches  
to problem solving. This is often due to the culture of the industry and  
its managers\: their educational backgrounds, their professional experi-  
ences and responsibilities en route to leadership positions, and the skills  
required to succeed in the industry.  
Again, the airline industry serves as a good example. Modern air-  
lines cannot run without information systems\: systems for ticketing and  
reservations, scheduling crews and aircraft, handling baggage, planning  
meals and operational control \(rerouting aircraft because of delays and  
breakdowns, and so on\). Also, airline managers are accustomed to ap-  
plying scientific methods in managing these various operations. In fact,  
long before RM was practiced in the industry, most large airlines had  
staffs of operations researchers working on complex problems of schedul-  
ing and fleet assignment. When RM came along, the management and  
culture in the industry were therefore well conditioned to accept it.  
**1.3.4 Industry Adopters Beyond the Airlines**  
What do these conditions imply for adopters of RM technology? Chap-  
ter 10 reviews specific industry adopters in detail, so here we only briefly  
mention some of them.  
The production-inflexibility characteristics of airlines are shared by  
many other service industries, such as hotels, cruise ship lines, car rental  
companies, theaters and sporting venues, and radio/TV broadcasters, to  
name a few. Indeed, RM is strongly associated with service industries.  
Retailers have recently begun to adopt RM, especially in the fashion  
apparel, consumer electronics, and toy sectors. Retail demand is highly  
volatile and uncertain, consumers’ valuations change rapidly over time,  
and with short selling seasons and long production and distribution lead  
times, supply is quite inflexible. On the technology front, the introduc-  
tion of bar codes and point-of-sale \(POS\) technology has resulted in a  
high degree of automation of sales transactions for most major retailers.  
The energy sector has been a recent adopter of RM methods as well,  
principally in the area of managing the sale of pipeline capacity for gas  
transportation. Again, energy demands are volatile and uncertain, and  
the technology for generating and transmitting electricity and gas can  
be inflexible. Also, thanks to deregulation in the industry, there has *Introduction* 17  
been a lot of experimentation and innovation in the pricing practices of  
energy, gas, and transmission markets.  
Manufacturing is potentially a vast market for RM methods, though  
to date relatively few instance of the practice have been documented.  
To a large extent this is due to the fact that supply is more flexible,  
and, for durable goods, customers have more flexibility in their pur-  
chase timing. This somewhat diminishes the impact of RM and creates  
unique challenges for the methodology as well. Still, there is immense  
interest in RM in manufacturing. Enterprise resource planning \(ERP\),  
supply-chain management \(SCM\), and customer-relationship manage-  
ment \(CRM\) systems are commonplace in the industry, and most man-  
ufacturers have huge amounts of data and heavily automated business  
processes, which could form the foundations for RM. Indeed, in the auto  
industry Ford Motor Corporation recently completed a high-profile im-  
plementation of RM technology \[135\].  
What about future adopters of RM? Given the criteria outlined above,  
one can argue that many industries are potential candidates. Almost all  
businesses must deal with demand variability, uncertainty, and customer  
heterogeneity. Most are subject to some sort of supply or production  
inflexibility. Finally, thanks largely to the wave of enterprise software  
and e-commerce innovation of late, many firms have now automated  
their business processes. All of these factors bode well for the future of  
RM.  
Nevertheless, as with any technological and business-practice innova-  
tion, the case for RM ultimately boils down to a cost-benefit analysis for  
each individual firm. For some, the potential benefit will simply never  
justify the costs of implementing RM systems and business processes.  
However, we believe that for the majority of firms, RM will eventually  
be justified once the technology and methodology in their industry ma-  
tures. Indeed, the history of RM in industries such as airlines, hotels,  
and retail suggests that once the technology gains a foothold in an indus-  
try, it spreads quite rapidly. As a result, we would not be surprised to  
see RM systems \(or systems performing RM functions under a different  
label\) become as ubiquitous as ERP, SCM, and CRM systems are today.  
**1.4 An Overview of a RM System**  
Here, we give a brief description of the generic operations of a RM  
system. This introduces the key components and gives an overview of  
the information flows, controls, and design of a RM system. The details  
of the science and systems involved in each component are covered in  
later chapters.  
RM generally follows four steps\: 18 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
1*.*  
Data collection\: Collect and store relevant historical data \(prices,  
demand, causal factors\).  
2.  
Estimation and forecasting\: Estimate the parameters of the demand  
model; forecast demand based on these parameters; forecast other rel-  
evant quantities like no-show and cancellation rates, based on trans-  
action data.  
3.  
Optimization\: Find the optimal set of controls \(allocations, prices,  
markdowns, discounts, overbooking limits\) to apply until the next  
re-optimization.  
4.  
Control\: Control the sale of inventory using the optimized control.  
This is done either through the firm’s own transaction-processing  
systems or through shared distribution systems \(such as GDSs\).  
The RM process typically involves cycling through these steps at re-  
peated intervals. The frequency with which each step is performed is  
a function of many factors such as the volume of data, the speed that  
business conditions change, the type of forecasting and optimization  
methods used, and the relative importance of the resulting decisions.  
For example, most RM systems in airline and hotel applications stag-  
ger the dates—data collection points \(DCPs\)—when they collect data,  
reforecast, and reoptimize, with the cycle occurring more frequently \(at  
least daily\) as the service time nears. This is because in these industries,  
a substantial portion of the reservations occurs during the last few days  
before the time of service.  
Figure 1.2 shows the process flow in a RM system. Data is fed to  
the forecaster; the forecasts become input to the control optimizer; and  
finally the controls are uploaded to the transaction-processing system,  
which controls actual sales.  
**1.5 The State of the RM Profession**  
On the practice side, the profession can be divided into *users* \(the firms  
and individuals who use RM methods to manage their business\) and  
*vendors* \(the firms and individuals who develop and supply technology  
and consulting services to users\). Of course, this division is not always  
sharp. Many users of RM, especially in the airline industry, have research  
and development organizations that provide significant components of  
their firm’s RM technology. Still, most users—even those with their own  
RM staff—rely on vendors in part or whole for their technology. Often,  
the role of a user’s R&D staff is to serve as in-house technology advisers  
and consultants, helping senior management evaluate new technologies  
and manage the relationships with the firm’s technology vendors. *Introduction* 19  
In most user organizations, the vast majority of RM staff are involved  
in day-to-day RM operational activities\: training and supervision of  
field staff, managing pricing and capacity controls in individual mar-  
kets, overseeing automated decisions and intervening where necessary or 20 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
maintaining computer systems. The typical senior management titles in  
such organizations are *VP of RM* or *VP of pricing and inventory control.*  
The organization typically has a corporate staff that is responsible for  
overall RM strategy, policy and systems and line management and staff  
responsible for RM processes in specific business units and markets.  
Except for a few large airlines that develop their own systems, RM  
software is developed by a handful of RM vendors, many of whom spe-  
cialize in a particular industry. Most of these firms have both a sci-  
entific staff to develop models and algorithms \(operations researchers,  
marketing scientists, statisticians, economists\), an IT and software staff  
to develop the associated software and systems, and a consulting staff to  
provide training and implementation services. The resulting products  
are usually customized for each user’s particular business conditions.  
Vendors also provide training and consulting in the use of the systems.  
To this list of RM-specific vendors, one ought to add the major enterprise  
software and technology companies and general IT consulting and soft-  
ware companies that, though not specifically identified as RM vendors,  
nevertheless provide some RM products and services.  
**1.6 Chapter Organization and Reading Guide**  
We next describe the organization of the book and then provide our  
suggestions for how to approach the material.  
**1.6.1 Chapter Organization**  
The book is divided into three main parts. Part I addresses *quantity-*  
*based RM,* in which the primary demand-management decisions concern  
product rationing and availability control—how much to sell to whom,  
whether to accept or reject requests for products, and so on. These are  
the core set of problems behind traditional airline RM and closely related  
industries like hotels and rental car industries. Part I is comprised of  
these chapters\:  
Chapter 2, Single-Resource Capacity Control\: This chapter looks at  
capacity controls for a single resource \(seats on a single flight, ho-  
tel rooms on a single night\) that is sold to differentiated demand  
classes—the so-called single-leg problem in airline RM parlance. We  
provide a comprehensive treatment of the classic exact and heuris-  
tic approaches to this problem, as well as a number of more recent  
advances.  
Chapter 3, Network Capacity Control\: This chapter looks at the  
same capacity-control decisions, but in a setting in which products  
require multiple resources—called the *network problem.* The main *Introduction* 21  
motivation is controlling availability of discount classes at an origin-  
destination \(O&D\) level in an airline network. However, hotels face  
a similar network problem when they control capacity by length of  
stay. Because the network capacity-control problem is significantly  
more complex than the single-resource problem, most of the methods  
in this chapter are based on approximations.  
Chapter 4, Overbooking\: This chapter looks at the practice of  
overbooking—accepting more reservations than physical capacity as  
a hedge against cancellations. The topic is somewhat specialized  
to reservation-based industries like airlines, hotels, and car rentals.  
While in a sense overbooking is a demand-management decision, it  
is somewhat different from the pricing and allocation decisions of the  
other chapters. However, overbooking is intimately connected to RM  
in the airline and hotel industries and is almost always implemented  
in conjunction with RM capacity controls. It is also extremely im-  
portant economically in these industries and forms a significant and  
visible part of RM.  
Part II of the book examines *price-based RM,* in which the primary  
demand decisions are prices—how to price to various customer groups or  
how to vary prices over time. Both posted price and auction mechanisms  
are considered. These price-based RM problems are more typical of retail  
and manufacturing RM. Part II has two chapters\:  
Chapter 5, Dynamic Pricing\: In this chapter we look at a problem in  
which the principle demand decision is how to adjust prices over time,  
subject to demand variability and uncertainty and various constraints  
or costs on re-supply. Many of the retail RM systems are based on  
the types of models discussed in this chapter.  
Chapter 6, Auctions\: Auctions are an important and long-standing  
pricing mechanism in many industries and, with the rise of e-  
commerce, have gained popularity as a alternatives to posted pricing.  
The basic types of auctions are discussed along with the theory of op-  
timal auction design. We discuss the implications of this theory for  
dynamic pricing in general and look at classical auctions, dynamic  
auctions and network auctions.  
Finally, the five chapters in Part III of the book examine components  
of RM that are common to both quantity and price-based RM\:  
Chapter 7, Customer Behavior and Market-Response Models\: This  
chapter summarizes the core demand-modeling theory and methodol- 22 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
ogy underlying RM. We discuss the basic theory of consumer behav-  
ior and develop several of the demand models used in both quantity  
and price-based RM. Both individual customer choice and aggregate  
market-demand models are covered.  
Chapter 8, The Economics of RM\: Here we discuss the economic  
theory of RM. We briefly survey classical monopoly and oligopoly  
pricing theory as well as the theory of price discrimination, peak-  
load pricing, and pricing under demand uncertainty, all of which are  
particularly relevant to understanding the strategies and tactics used  
in RM practice.  
Chapter 9, Estimation and Forecasting\: This chapter addresses the  
broad range of issues involved in estimating models from data and  
building forecasts of future demand. We survey the main estimation  
and forecasting methods commonly used in practice. The coverage is  
not intended to be as in-depth as specialized books on these topics  
but rather to review the basic assumptions and theory of each method  
and its role in RM practice.  
Chapter 10, Industry Profiles\: This chapter provides detailed de-  
scriptions of several industries practicing RM, including information  
on consumers, products, sales practice and technology—all of which  
impact the real world practice of RM. For experienced industry in-  
siders, much of this material may be well-known. However, for new  
employees in an industry, for academics, and for industry practi-  
tioners looking at a different industry, the chapter provides useful  
information on the institutional context in which RM is practiced.  
Chapter 11, Implementation\: This chapter discusses issues involved  
in implementing a RM system, including product design, organiza-  
tional and technology-management issues, all factors critical in mak-  
ing a RM system effective in application.  
**1.6.2 Reading Guide**  
Some readers will not want to read the book in strict sequential or-  
der. It is certainly possible to read Parts I and II independently of one  
another. Readers who are interested primarily in traditional quantity-  
based RM should begin with Part I, while those interested primarily in  
price-based RM problems could begin with Part II and then look at Part  
I afterwards. However, within Parts I and II chapters are interrelated,  
with later chapters building on ideas developed in earlier chapters.  
Each chapter provides a comprehensive introduction as well, so read-  
ers may wish to begin by looking through each of the chapter introduc- *Introduction* 23  
tions to get a sense of the scope of each one and then read individual  
chapters in detail according to their level of interest.  
Parts I and II can also be read largely independently of Part III,  
though the material in Part III provides useful background. While some  
readers may choose to use Part III only as a reference, in our view each  
chapter in Part III is also of significant independent interest. Readers  
interested in the theory underlying RM will find Chapter 7 on demand  
modeling and Chapter 8 on economics of particular interest. Those  
interested primarily in the applied elements of RM will find Chapter 9  
on forecasting methods and Chapters 10 and 11 on industry profiles and  
implementation \(respectively\) most useful.  
The chapters in Part III are not strongly interrelated and may be read  
in any order. However, the material in Part III is best understood in the  
context of the topics covered in Parts I and II; hence, we recommend  
at least skimming the introductions of chapters in Parts I and II before  
reading Part III in detail.  
**1.7 Notes and Sources**  
The 1997 book by Robert Cross, *RM\: Hard Core Tactics for Market*  
*Domination* \[137\] was influential in popularizing the story of airline RM  
and introducing the concept of RM to the general business community.  
Bob Cross was then chairman and CEO of Aeronomics, a RM consul-  
tancy and software firm. It is a nontechnical and lively book for a general  
audience , and is informative reading, providing nice descriptions of the  
early history of RM in the airline industry, many practical anecdotes,  
and insights into the philosophy and challenges of implementing RM.  
Several other books on RM have been published recently. One is an  
edited volume by Ingold, McMahon-Beattie, and Yeoman \[263\] that fo-  
cuses primarily on the hotel industry. Another, Daudel and Vialle \[146\],  
focuses on air transportation. Both, however, deal more with practical  
and conceptual issues and do not cover the scientific methods of RM  
in much depth. The book by Nagel and Holden \[400\] provides a com-  
prehensive overview of many managerial issues involved in pricing and  
is useful reading. However, it does not address tactical RM decision  
making in depth.  
Several survey articles provide general coverage of RM. The *Hand-*  
*book of Airline Economics* edited by Jenkins \[268\] provides several good  
practice-oriented articles on RM in the airline industry. Kimes \[301\] pro-  
vides a conceptual introduction to RM with a hotel RM focus. Smith et  
al. \[477\] provide a nice description of the practice of RM at American  
Airlines and the DINAMO system. 24 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
As for guides to the research literature, Weatherford and Bodily \[556\]  
propose a taxonomy for classifying the sets of assumptions used in  
many traditional RM models, although the taxonomy itself is little used.  
McGill and van Ryzin \[374\] provide a comprehensive overview and an-  
notated bibliography of the published academic literature in the field  
through 1998. Elmaghraby and Keskinocak \[177\] provide a survey on  
research in the area of dynamic pricing. **PART I**  
**QUANTITY-BASED RM**This page intentionally left blankChapter 2  
# SINGLE-RESOURCE  
# CAPACITY CONTROL  
**2.1 Introduction**  
In this chapter, we examine the problem of quantity-based revenue  
management for a single resource; specifically, optimally allocating ca-  
pacity of a resource to different classes of demand. Two prototypical  
examples are controlling the sale of different fare classes on a single flight  
leg of an airline and the sale of hotel rooms for a given date at differ-  
ent rate classes. This is to be contrasted with the multiple-resource—or  
network—problems of Chapter 3, in which customers require a bundle of  
different resources \(such as two connecting flights or a sequence of nights  
at the same hotel\). In reality, many quantity-based RM problems are  
network RM problems, but in practice, they are still frequently solved  
as a collection of single-resource problems \(treating the resources inde-  
pendently\). For this reason, it is important to study single-resource RM  
models. Moreover, single-resource models are useful as building blocks  
in heuristics for the network case.  
We assume that the firm sells its capacity in distinct classes1 that  
require the same resource. In the airline and hotel context, these classes  
represent different discount levels with differentiated sale conditions and  
restrictions. In the early parts of this chapter, we assume that these  
products appeal to distinct and mutually exclusive segments of the  
market\: the conditions of sale segment the market perfectly into  
segments—one for each class. Customers in each segment are eligible  
for or can afford only the class corresponding to their segment. Later in  
1In the case of airlines, these are called *fare classes.* Terms like *rate products, rate classes,*  
*revenue classes, booking classes* and *fare products* are also used. We shall use the generic  
term *class* in this chapter. 28 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
the chapter, we look at models that do not assume that customers are  
perfectly segmented, but instead that they choose among the classes.  
The units of capacity are assumed homogeneous, and customers de-  
mand a single unit of capacity for the resource. The central problem  
of the chapter is how to optimally allocate the capacity of the resource  
to the various classes. This allocation must be done dynamically as de-  
mand materializes and with considerable uncertainty about the quantity  
or composition of future demand. The remainder of the chapter focuses  
on various models and methods for making these capacity-allocation de-  
cisions.  
**2.1.1 Types of Controls**  
In the travel industry, reservation systems provide different mecha-  
nisms for controlling availability. These mechanisms are usually deeply  
embedded in the software logic of the reservation system and, as a re-  
sult, can be quite expensive and difficult to change. Therefore, the con-  
trol mechanisms chosen for a given implementation are often dictated  
by the reservation system. The details of reservations systems and the  
constraints they impose are discussed in greater detail in Chapters 10  
and 11. Here, we focus on the control mechanisms themselves.  
**2.1.1.1 Booking Limits**  
*Booking limits* are controls that limit the amount of capacity that can  
be sold to any particular class at a given point in time. For example, a  
booking limit of 18 on class 2 indicates that at most 18 units of capacity  
can be sold to customers in class 2. Beyond this limit, the class would  
be “closed” to additional class 2 customers. This limit of 18 may be  
less than the physical capacity. For example, we might want to protect  
capacity for future demand from class 1 customers.  
Booking limits are either *partitioned* or *nested*\: A *partitioned booking*  
*limit* divides the available capacity into separate blocks \(or *buckets*\) —  
one for each class—that can be sold only to the designated class. For  
example, with 30 units to sell, a partitioned booking limit may set a  
booking limit of 12 units for class 1, 10 units for class 2, and 8 units for  
class 3. If the 12 units of class 1 capacity are used up, class 1 would  
be closed regardless of how much capacity is available in the remaining  
buckets. This could be undesirable if class 1 has higher revenues than  
do classes 2 and 3 and the units allocated to class 1 are sold out.  
With a *nested booking limit,* the capacity available to different classes  
overlaps in a hierarchical manner—with higher-ranked classes having  
access to all the capacity reserved for lower-ranked classes \(and perhaps  
more\). Let the nested booking limit for class be denoted Then *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 29  
is the maximum number of units of capacity we are willing to sell  
to classes and lower. So in Figure 2.1, the nested booking limit on  
class 1 and lower \(all classes\) would be \(the entire capacity\), the  
nested booking limit on classes 2 and 3 combined would be and  
the nested booking limit on class 3 alone would be We would  
accept at most 30 bookings for classes 1, 2, and 3, at most 18 for classes  
2 and 3 combined, and at most 8 for class 3 customers. Effectively, this  
logic simply allows any capacity “left over” after selling to low classes  
to become available for sale to higher classes.  
Nesting booking limits in this way avoids the problem of capacity  
being simultaneously unavailable for a high class yet available for lower  
classes. Most reservations systems that use booking-limit controls quite  
sensibly use nested rather than partitioned booking limits for this reason. 30 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**2.1.1.2 Protection Levels**  
A *protection level* specifies an amount of capacity to reserve \(protect\)  
for a particular class or set of classes. Again, protection levels can be  
*nested* or *partitioned.* A partitioned protection level is trivially equivalent  
to a partitioned booking limit; a booking limit of 18 on class 2 sales is  
equivalent to protecting 18 units of capacity for class 2.  
In the nested case, protection levels are again defined for sets of  
classes—ordered in a hierarchical manner according to class order. Sup-  
pose class 1 is the highest class, class 2 the second highest, and so on.  
Then the protection level denoted is defined as the amount of ca-  
pacity to save for classes combined—that is, for classes  
and higher \(in terms of class order\). Continuing our example, we might  
set a protection level of 12 for class 1 \(meaning 12 units of capacity  
would be protected for sale only to class 1\), a protection level of 22 for  
classes 1 and 2 combined, and a protection level of 30 for classes 1, 2,  
and 3 combined. \(Though frequently no protection level is specified for  
this last case since it is clear that all the capacity is available to at least  
one of the classes.\)  
Figure 2.1 shows the relationship between protection levels and book-  
ing limits. The booking limit for class is simply the capacity minus  
the protection level for classes and higher. That is,  
where *C* is the capacity. For convenience, we define class has a booking limit equal to the capacity\) and combined have a protection level equal to capacity\).  
\(the highest  
\(all classes  
**2.1.1.3 Standard Versus Theft Nesting**  
The standard process for using booking limits or nested protection  
levels proceeds as follows. Starting with *C* units of capacity, we begin  
receiving bookings. A bookings for class is accepted provided \(1\) there  
is capacity remaining and \(2\) the total number of requests accepted for  
class to date is less than the booking limit \(equivalently, the current  
capacity remaining is more than the protection level for classes  
higher than \). This is called *standard nesting,* and it is the most natural  
and common way to implement nested-capacity controls.  
Another alternative, which is less prevalent though still encountered  
occasionally in practice, is called *theft nesting.* In theft nesting, a book-  
ing in class not only reduces the allocation for class but also “steals”  
from the allocation of all lower classes. So when we accept a request for  
class not only is the class allocation reduced by one but so are the  
allocations for classes This is equivalent to keeping *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 31  
units of capacity protected for *future* demand from class In other words, even though we just accepted a request for class theft nesting we continue to reserve units for class and higher.  
under  
and higher, and  
to do so requires reducing the allocation for classes  
Under standard nesting, in contrast, when we accept a request from class  
we effectively reduce by one the capacity we protect for future demand  
from class and higher.  
The rationale for standard nesting is that the capacity protected for,  
say, class 1 is based on a forecast of future demand for class 1. Once  
we observe some demand for class 1, we then *reduce* our estimate of  
future demand—and hence the capacity we protect for class 1. Standard  
nesting does this by reducing the capacity protected for future class 1  
demand on a one-for-one basis after each arriving request is accepted  
\(and similarly for other classes as well\). To illustrate, suppose in our  
example demand for class 1 is deterministic and equal to the protection  
level Then if we receive 5 requests for class 1, we know for  
certain that future demand for class 1 will be only 7 and hence that it  
makes sense to reduce the capacity we protect for future demand from  
12 to 7, which is precisely what standard nesting does. Theft nesting, in  
contrast, intuitively corresponds to an assumption of “memorylessness”  
in demand. In other words, it assumes the demand to date for class 1  
does not affect our estimate of *future* demand for class 1. Therefore,  
we continue to protect units of capacity for class 1 \(and hence must  
reduce the allocation for classes \).  
The two forms of nesting are in fact equivalent if demand arrives  
strictly in low-to-high class order; that is, the demand for class ar-  
rives first, followed by the demand for class and so on.2 This is  
what the standard \(static\) single-resource models assume, so for these  
static models, the distinction is not important. However, in practice  
demand rarely arrives in low-to-high order, and the choice of standard  
versus theft nesting matters. With mixed order of arrivals, theft nesting  
protects more capacity for higher classes \(equivalently, allocates less ca-  
pacity to lower classes\). Again, however, standard nesting is the norm  
in RM practice.  
**2.1.1.4 Bid Prices**  
What distinguishes bid-price controls from both booking limits and  
protection levels is that they are revenue-based rather than class-based  
controls. Specifically, a bid-price control sets a threshold price \(which  
2It is easy to convince oneself of this fact by tracing out the accept/deny decisions under  
both forms of nesting, and doing so is an instructive exercise. 32 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
may depend on variables such as the remaining capacity or time\), such  
that a request is accepted if its revenue exceeds the threshold price and  
rejected if its revenue is less than the threshold price. Bid-price controls  
are, in principle, simpler than booking-limit or protection-level controls  
because they require only storing a single threshold value at any point  
in time—rather than a set of capacity numbers, one for each class. But  
to be effective, bid prices must be updated after each sale—and possibly  
also with time as well—and this typically requires storing a table of bid  
price values indexed by the current available capacity, current time, or  
both.  
Figure 2.1 shows how bid prices can be used to implement the same  
nested-allocation policy as booking limits and protection levels. The bid  
price is plotted as a function of the remaining capacity When  
there are 12 or fewer units remaining, the bid price is over \$75 but less  
than \$100, so only class 1 demand is accepted. With 13 to 22 units  
remaining, the bid price is over \$50 but less than \$75 so only classes 1  
and 2 are accepted. With more than 22 units of capacity available, the  
bid price drops below \$50 so all three classes are accepted.  
Bid-price control is criticized by some as being “unsafe”—the argu-  
ment being that having a threshold price as the only control means that  
the RM system will sell an unlimited amount of capacity to any class  
whose revenues exceed the bid price threshold. But this is true only if  
the bid price is not updated. As shown in Figure 2.1, if the bid price is a  
function of the current remaining capacity, then it performs exactly like  
a booking limit or protection level, closing off capacity to successively  
higher classes as capacity is consumed. Without this ability to make bid  
prices a function of capacity, however, a simple static threshold is indeed  
a somewhat dangerous form of control.  
One potential advantage of bid-price controls is their ability to dis-  
criminate based on revenue rather than class. Often \(see Section 10.1.3.1\)  
a number of products with different prices are booked in a single class.  
RM systems then use an average price as the price associated with a  
class. However, if actual revenue information is available for each re-  
quest, then a bid-price control can selectively accept only the higher  
revenue requests in a class, whereas a control based on class designa-  
tion alone can only accept or reject all requests of a class. Of course, if  
the exact revenue is not observable at the time of reservation, then this  
advantage is lost.  
**2.1.2 Displacement Cost**  
While the mathematics of optimal capacity controls can become com-  
plex, the overriding logic is simple. First, capacity should be allocated *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 33  
to a request if and only if its revenue is greater than the value of the  
capacity required to satisfy it. Second, the value of capacity should  
be measured by its \(expected\) *displacement cost*—or *opportunity cost*—  
which is the expected loss in future revenue from using the capacity now  
rather than reserving it for future use.  
Theoretically, the displacement-cost idea is captured by using a *value*  
*function,* that measures the optimal expected revenue as a function  
of the remaining capacity The displacement cost is then the difference  
between the value function at and the value function at or  
Much of the theoretical analysis of the capacity controls  
boils down to analyzing this value function. But conceptually, the logic  
is simply to compare revenues to displacement costs to make the accept  
or deny decision.  
**2.2 Static Models**  
In this section, we examine one of the first models for quantity-based  
RM, the so-called *static*3 single-resource models.  
The static model makes several assumptions that are worth exam-  
ining in some detail. The first is that demand for the different classes  
arrives in nonoverlapping intervals in the order of increasing prices of the  
classes.4 In reality, demand for the different classes may overlap in time.  
However, the nonoverlapping-intervals assumption is a reasonable ap-  
proximation \(for example, advance-purchase discount demand typically  
arrives before full-fare coach demand in the airline case\). Moreover, the  
optimal controls that emerge from the model can be applied—at least  
heuristically—even where demand comes in arbitrary order \(using ei-  
ther bid prices or the nesting policies, for example\). As for the strict  
low-before-high assumption, this represents something of a worst-case  
scenario; for instance, if high-revenue demand arrives before low-revenue  
demand, the problem is trivial because we simply accept demand first  
come, first serve.  
The second main assumption is that the demands for different classes  
are independent random variables. Largely, this assumption is made  
for analytical convenience because to deal with dependence in the de-  
mand structure would require introducing complex state variables on  
the history of observed demand. We can make some justification of the  
3The term *static* here is somewhat of a misnomer because demand does arrive sequentially  
over time, albeit in stages ordered from low-revenue to high-revenue demand. However, this  
term is now standard and helps distinguish this class of models from *dynamic* models that  
allow arbitrary arrival orders.  
4Robinson \[445\] generalizes the static model to the case where demand from each class arrives  
in nonoverlapping intervals but the order is not necessarily from low to high revenue. 34 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
assumption by appealing to the forecast inputs to the model. That is, to  
the extent that there are systematic factors affecting *all* demand classes  
\(such as seasonalities\), these are often reflected in the forecast and be-  
come part of the *explained* variation in demand in the forecasting model  
\(for example, as the differences in the forecasted means and variance  
on different days\). The randomness in the single-resource model is then  
only the residual, unexplained variation in demand. So, for example, the  
fact that demand for all classes may increase on peak flights does not in  
itself cause problems provided the increase is predicted by the forecast-  
ing method. Still, one has to worry about possible residual dependence  
in the *unexplained variation* in demand, and this is a potential weakness  
of the independence assumption.  
A third assumption is that demand for a given class does not depend  
on the capacity controls; in particular, it does not depend on the avail-  
ability of other classes. Its only justification is if the multiple restrictions  
associated with each class are so well designed that customers in a high  
revenue class will not buy down to a lower class and if the prices are  
so well separated that customers in a lower class will not buy up to a  
higher class if the lower class is closed. However, neither is really true  
in practice. There is considerable porousness \(imperfect segmentation\)  
in the design of the restrictions, and the price differences between the  
classes are rarely that dispersed. The assumption that demand does  
not depend on the capacity controls is therefore a weakness, though in  
Section 2.6 we look at models that handle imperfect segmentation.  
Fourth, the static model suppresses many details about the demand  
and control process within each of the periods. This creates a potential  
source of confusion when relating these models to actual RM systems. In  
particular, the static model assumes an aggregate quantity of demand  
arrives in a single stage and the decision is simply how much of this  
demand to accept. Yet in a real reservation system, we typically observe  
demand sequentially over time, or it may come in batch downloads.  
The control decision has to be made knowing only the demand observed  
to date and is usually implemented in the form of prespecified controls  
uploaded to the reservation system. These details are essentially ignored  
in the static model. However, fortunately \(and perhaps surprisingly\), the  
form of the optimal control is not sensitive to this assumption and can  
be applied quite independently of how the demand is realized within  
a period \(all at once, sequentially, or in batches\). The simplicity and  
robustness of the optimal control is in fact a central result of the theory  
for this class of models.  
A fifth assumption of the model is that either there are no groups, or  
if there are group bookings, they can be partially accepted. Group book- *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 35  
ings cause significant methodological problems, and these are discussed  
in Section 2.4.  
Finally, the static models assume risk-neutrality. This is a reasonable  
assumption in practice, since a firm implementing RM typically makes  
such decisions for a large number of products sold repeatedly \(for ex-  
ample, daily flights, daily hotel room stays, and so on\). Maximizing  
the average revenue, therefore, is what matters in the end. While we  
do not cover this case here, some researchers have recently analyzed  
the single-resource problem with risk-averse decision makers \(Feng and  
Xiao \[187\]\).  
We start with the simple two-class model in order to build some basic  
intuition and then examine the more general case.  
**2.2.1 Littlewood’s Two-Class Model**  
The earliest single-resource model for quantity-based RM is due to  
Littlewood \[347\]. The model assumes two product classes, with asso-  
ciated prices The capacity is *C,* and we assume there are no  
cancellations or overbooking. Demand for class is denoted and its  
distribution is denoted by Demand for class 2 arrives first. The  
problem is to decide how much class 2 demand to accept before seeing  
the realization of class 1 demand.  
The two-class problem is similar to the classic *newsboy problem* in in-  
ventory theory, and the optimal decision can be derived informally using  
a simple marginal analysis\: Suppose that we have units of capacity re-  
maining and we receive a request from class 2. If we accept the request,  
we collect revenues of If we do not accept it, we will sell unit \(the  
marginal unit\) at if and only if demand for class 1 is or higher.  
That is, if and only if Thus, the expected gain from reserving  
the unit for class 1 \(the *expected marginal value*\) is  
Therefore, it makes sense to accept a class 2 request as long as its price  
exceeds this marginal value, or equivalently, if and only if  
Note the right-hand side of \(2.1\) is decreasing in be an optimal protection level, denoted the remaining capacity exceeds is or less. Formally, satisfies  
Therefore, there will  
such that we accept class 2 if  
and reject it if the remaining capacity  
If a continuous distribution the case\), then the optimal protection level is used to model demand \(as is often  
is given by the simpler 36 expressions  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
which is known as *Littlewood’s rule.* Setting a protection level of for  
class 1 according to Littlewood’s rule is an optimal policy. Equivalently,  
setting a booking limit of on class 2 demand is optimal.  
Alternatively, we can use a bid-price control with the bid price set at  
We omit a rigorous proof of Littlewood’s rule since it is a special case  
of a more general result proved below. However, to gain some insight  
into it, consider the following example\:  
**Example 2.1** Suppose is normally distributed with mean and standard devi-  
ation Then by Littlewood’s rule, which implies the optimal  
protection level can be expressed as  
where and denotes the inverse of the standard normal  
c.d.f. Thus, we reserve enough capacity to meet the mean demand for class 1, plus  
or minus a factor that depends both on the revenue ratio and the demand variation  
If the optimal protection level is less than the mean demand; and  
if it is greater than the mean demand. In general, the lower the ratio  
the more capacity we reserve for class 1. This makes intuitive sense because  
we should be willing to take very low prices only when the chances of selling at a high  
price are lower.  
**2.2.2 Models**  
We next consider the general case of classes. Again, we assume  
that demand for the classes arrives in stages, one for each class,  
with classes arriving in increasing order of their revenue values. Let the  
classes be indexed so that Hence, class \(the  
lowest price\) demand arrives in the first stage \(stage \), followed by  
class demand in stage and so on, with the highest price class  
\(class 1\) arriving in the last stage \(stage 1\). Since there is a one-to-one  
correspondence between stages and classes, we index both by Demand  
and capacity are most often assumed to be discrete, but occasionally we  
model them as continuous variables when it helps simplify the analysis  
and optimality conditions.  
**2.2.2.1 Dynamic Programming Formulation**  
This problem can be formulated as a dynamic program in the stages  
\(equivalently, classes\), with the remaining capacity being the state  
variable. At the start of each stage the demand has *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 37  
not been realized. Within stage sequence of events occurs\:  
1.  
The realization of the demand the model assumes that the following  
occurs, and we observe its value.  
2.  
We decide on a quantity of this demand to accept. The amount  
accepted must be less than the capacity remaining, so The  
optimal control is therefore a function of the stage the capacity  
and the demand though we often suppress  
this explicit dependence on and in what follows.  
3.  
The revenue is collected, and we proceed to the start of stage  
with a remaining capacity of  
This sequence of events is assumed for analytical convenience; we  
derive the optimal control “as if” the decision on the amount to  
accept is made *after* knowing the value of demand In reality, of  
course, demand arrives sequentially over time, and the control decision  
has to be made *before* observing all the demand However, it turns  
out that optimal decisions do not use the prior knowledge of as we  
show below. Hence, the assumption that is known is not restrictive.  
Let denote the value function at the start of stage Once the  
value is observed, the value of is chosen to maximize the current  
stage revenue plus the revenue to go, or  
subject to the constraint entering stage with respect to the demand The value function  
is then the expected value of this optimization  
Hence, the Bellman equation is5  
with boundary conditions  
The values that maximize the right-hand side of \(2.3\) for each form an optimal control policy for this model.  
and  
5Readers familiar with dynamic programming may notice that this Bellman equation is of  
the form E\[max\{·\}\] and not max *E*\[·\] as in many standard texts. The relationship between  
these two forms is explained in detail in Appendix D. But essentially, the max *E*\[·\] form can  
be recovered by considering the demand to be a state variable along with While the  
two forms can be shown to be equivalent, the *E*\[max\{·\}\] is simpler to work with in many  
RM problems. In our case, this leads to the modeling assumption that we optimize “as if”  
we observed 38 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**2.2.2.2 Optimal Policy\: Discrete Demand and Capacity**  
We first consider the case where demand and capacity are discrete.  
To analyze the form of the optimal control in this case, define  
is the *expected marginal value of capacity* at stage ex-  
pected incremental value of the unit of capacity. A key result con-  
cerns how these marginal values change with capacity and the stage  
\(See Appendix 2.A for proof.\)\:  
PROPOSITION 2.1 *The marginal values defined by \(2.3\) satisfy*  
*of the value function*  
*\(i\)*  
*\(ii\)*  
That is, at a given stage the marginal value is decreasing in the  
remaining capacity, and at a given capacity level the marginal value  
increases in the number of stages remaining. These two properties are  
intuitive and greatly simplify the control. To see this, consider the opti-  
mization problem at stage From \(2.3\) and the definition of  
we can write  
where we take the summation above to be empty if Since  
is decreasing in by Proposition 2.1\(i\), it follows that the terms in the  
sum are decreasing in Thus, it is optimal to  
increase \(keep adding terms\) until the terms  
become negative or the upper bound is reached, whichever  
comes first.  
The resulting optimal control can be expressed in terms of optimal  
protection levels for \(class and higher in the revenue  
order\) by  
\(Recall the optimal protection level control at stage is then  
by convention.\) The optimal  
where the notation quantity denotes the positive part of The  
is the remaining capacity in excess of the protection *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 39  
level, which is the maximum capacity we are willing to sell to class  
The situation is shown in Figure 2.2.  
In practice, we can simply post the protection level in a reserva-  
tion system and accept requests first come, first serve until the capacity  
threshold is reached or the stage ends, whichever comes first. Thus,  
the optimal protection-level control at stage requires no informa-  
tion about the demand yet it produces the same optimal decision  
“as if” we knew exactly at the start of stage The reason  
for this is that knowledge of does not affect the future value of ca-  
pacity, Deciding to accept or reject each request simply involves  
comparing current revenues to the marginal cost of capacity, and this  
comparison does not depend on how many requests there  
are in total.  
Proposition 2.1\(ii\) implies the nested protection structure  
This fact is easily seen from Figure 2.2. If increases with and the  
curve decreases with then the optimal protection level will  
shift to the left \(decrease\). Together, this ordering produces the nested  
protection-level structure.  
One can also use booking limits in place of protection levels to achieve  
the same control. Optimal nested booking limits are defined by 40 with *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The optimal control in stage is then to accept  
Note that is the total capacity sold prior to stage and  
is the booking limit for class so is the remaining  
capacity available for class The optimal booking limit is also shown  
in Figure 2.2.  
Finally, the optimal control can also be implemented through a table  
of bid prices. Indeed, if we define the stage bid price by  
then the optimal control is  
In words, we accept the request in stage if the price  
exceeds the bid price value of the unit of capacity that  
is allocated. In practice, we can store a table of bid prices and process  
requests by sequentially comparing the price of each product to the table  
values corresponding to the remaining capacity.  
We summarize these results in the following theorem\:  
THEOREM 2.1 *For the static model defined by \(2.3\), the optimal control*  
*can be achieved using either*  
*\(i\) Nested protection levels defined by \(2.4\),*  
*\(ii\) Nested booking limits defined by \(2.6\), or*  
*\(iii\) Bid price tables defined by \(2.7\).*  
How to compute these various policies is discussed in Section 2.2.3.  
**2.2.2.3 Optimality Conditions for Continuous Demand**  
Next, consider the case where capacity is continuous and demand at  
each stage has a continuous distribution. In this case, the dynamic pro-  
gram is still given by \(2.3\); however and are now continuous  
quantities. The analysis of the dynamic program is slightly more com-  
plex than it is in the discrete-demand case, but many of the details are  
quite similar. Hence, we only briefly describe the key differences.  
The main change is that the marginal value is now replaced  
by the derivative of with respect to This derivative  
is still interpreted as the marginal expected value of capacity. And an  
argument nearly identical to that in the proof of Proposition 2.1 shows  
that the marginal value is decreasing in \(equivalently,  
is concave in \). *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 41  
Therefore, the optimal control in stage \(keep accepting demand\) as long as  
is to keep increasing  
and to stop accepting once this condition is violated or the demand  
is exhausted, whichever comes first. Again, this decision rule can  
be implemented with optimal protection levels, defined by  
One of the chief virtues of the continuous model is that it leads to  
simplified expressions for the optimal vector of protection levels  
We state the basic result without proof \(see Brumelle and  
McGill \[91\] for a proof\).  
First, for an arbitrary vector of protection levels **y** and vector of de-  
mands define the following *fill events*  
is the event that demand to come in stages exceeds  
the corresponding protection levels. A necessary and sufficient condition  
for to be an optimal vector of protection levels is that it satisfy the  
equations  
That is, the fill event should occur with probability equal to the ratio  
of class revenue to class 1 revenue. As it should, this reduces to  
Littlewood’s rule \(2.2\) in the case, since  
Note that  
so the event can occur only if occurs. Also, if  
then Thus, if we must  
have to satisfy \(2.9\). Thus, the optimal protection levels are  
strictly increasing in if the revenues are strictly decreasing in  
**2.2.3 Computational Approaches**  
At first glance it may appear that the optimal nested allocations are  
difficult to compute. However, computing these values is in fact quite  
easy and efficient algorithmically. There are two basic approaches\: dy-  
namic programming and Monte Carlo integration. 42 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**2.2.3.1 Dynamic Programming**  
The first approach is based on using the dynamic programming recur-  
sion \(2.3\) directly and requires that demand and capacity are discrete—  
or in the continuous case that these quantities can be suitably dis-  
cretized. The inner optimization in \(2.3\) is simplified by using the op-  
timal protection levels from the previous stage. Thus, substituting  
\(2.5\) into \(2.3\) we obtain the recursion  
where is determined using \(2.4\), and we define This procedure  
is repeated starting from and working backward to  
For discrete-demand distributions, computing the expectation in  
\(2.10\) for each state requires evaluating at most *O\(C\)* terms since  
Since there are *C* states \(capacity levels\),  
the complexity at each stage is The critical values can then  
be identified from \(2.4\) in log\(*C*\) time by binary search as is  
nonincreasing. Indeed, since we know the binary search can  
be further constrained to values in the interval Therefore,  
computing does not add to the complexity at stage Since these  
steps must be repeated for each of the stages \(stage need not be  
computed as mentioned above\), the total complexity of the recursion is  
**2.2.3.2 Monte Carlo Integration**  
The second approach to computing optimal protection levels is based  
on using \(2.9\) together with Monte Carlo integration. It is most natu-  
rally suited to the case of continuous demand and capacity, though the  
discrete case can be computed \(at least heuristically\) with this method  
as well.  
The idea is to simulate a large number *K* of demand vectors,  
from the forecast distributions for the  
classes. We then progressively sort through these values to find thresh-  
olds **y** that approximately satisfy \(2.9\).  
In what follows, it is convenient to note that  
Thus, \(2.9\) implies that the optimal must satisfy *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 43  
since optimal The following algorithm computes the  
approximately using the empirical conditional probabilities  
estimated from the sample of simulated demand data\:  
**STEP 0\:** Generate and store *K* random demand vectors  
For and compute the partial sums  
and form the vector  
Initialize a list and counter  
**STEP 1\:** Sort the vectors by their component values,  
Let denote the element of in this sorted list so that  
**STEP 2\:** Set Set  
**STEP 3\:** Set and  
IF STOP  
ELSE GOTO STEP 1.  
The complexity of this method is which is nearly linear  
in the number of simulated demand vectors *K.* Thus, it is relatively  
efficient even with large samples. It is also quite simple to program  
and can be used with any general distribution. The following example  
illustrates the method\:  
**Example 2.2** Consider a three-class example, where the prices are  
and The demand for each class is normally distributed. Class 1 has  
a mean of 20 and standard deviation of 9; class 2 has a mean of 45 and standard  
deviation of 12. \(The statistics for class 3 do not affect the calculation.\)  
Figure 2.3 shows a plot of the partial sums and for 50  
simulated data points of this problem. Since the first ratio the  
Monte Carlo algorithm starts by finding a value such that 70% of these points \(35  
points\) have values above The result is shown in Figure 2.3 by the vertical line  
at  
In the next iteration of the algorithm, the 35 points to the right of this vertical  
line are sorted again by their value and is chosen so that a fraction  
of the points \(21 points\) lie above This occurs at  
The algorithm then terminates with the estimates and 44 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**2.2.4 Heuristics**  
As we have seen, computing optimal controls for the static single-  
resource model is not particularly difficult. Despite this fact, exact op-  
timization models are not widely used in practice. Indeed, most single-  
resource airline RM systems use one of several heuristics to compute  
booking limits and protection levels.  
There are two main reasons for this state of affairs. The first is simply  
a case of practice being one step ahead of the underlying theory. As men-  
tioned, in the airline industry the practice of using capacity controls to  
manage multiple classes quickly gained popularity following deregulation  
in the mid 1970s. But this predates the theory of optimal controls by  
more than a decade. The only known optimal controls in the 1970s were  
Littlewood’s results for the two-class problem. As a result, heuristics  
were developed for the general problem. During the decade fol-  
lowing deregulation, RM software embedded these heuristics, and people  
grew accustomed to thinking in terms of them. The inertia generated  
from this early use of the heuristics is one reason for their continued  
popularity today. *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 45  
Heuristics are also widely used because they are simpler to code,  
quicker to run, and generate revenues that in many cases are close to op-  
timal. Indeed, many practitioners in the airline industry simply believe  
that even the modest effort of computing optimal controls is not worth  
the benefit they provide in improved revenue performance. Proponents  
of heuristics argue that the potential improvement from getting better  
revenue data and improving demand forecasts swamps the gains from  
using optimal controls—reflecting the philosophy that it is better to be  
“approximately right” than it is to be “precisely wrong.”  
While these points are well taken, such criticisms are somewhat misdi-  
rected. For starters, using optimal controls does not mean one has to give  
up on improvements in other areas, such as forecasting. These activities  
are not mutually exclusive, though a understaffed development group  
might very well consider refining optimization modules a low-priority  
task. Yet given the very modest cost of coding and computing optimal  
controls, the strong objections to the use of optimal controls are often  
not entirely rational.  
Regardless of one’s view on the use of heuristics, it is important to  
understand them. They remain widely used in practice and can also  
help develop useful intuition.  
We next look at the two most popular heuristics\: EMSR-a and EMSR-  
b, both of which are attributed to Belobaba \[38–40\]. Both heuristics  
are based on the static, single-resource model defined above  
in Section 2.2. They differ only in how they approximate the prob-  
lem. Static model assumptions apply\: classes are indexed so that  
denotes the c.d.f. of class demand, and low-  
revenue demand arrives before high-revenue demand in stages that are  
indexed by as well. Moreover, for ease of exposition we assume that  
capacity and demand are continuous and that the distribution functions  
are continuous as well, though these assumptions  
are easily relaxed.  
**2.2.4.1 EMSR-a**  
EMSR-a *\(expected marginal seat revenue–version a\)* is the most widely  
publicized heuristic for the single-resource problem. Despite this fact,  
it is less popular in practice than its close cousin, EMSR-b, which sur-  
prisingly is not well documented in the literature. Generally, EMSR-b  
provides better revenue performance, and it is certainly more intuitive,  
though EMSR-a is important to know just the same.  
EMSR-a is based on the idea of adding the protection levels produced  
by applying Littlewood’s rule to successive pairs of classes. Consider  
stage in which demand of class arrives with price We are 46 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
interested in computing how much capacity to reserve for the remaining  
classes, that is, the protection level, for classes and  
higher. To do so, let’s consider a single class among the remaining  
classes and compare and *in isolation.* Considering  
only these two classes, we would use Littlewood’s rule \(2.2\) and reserve  
capacity for class where  
Repeating for each future class we could likewise  
compute how much capacity to reserve for each such class in isolation.  
The idea of EMSR-a, then, is simply to add up these individual protec-  
tion levels to approximate the total protection level for classes and  
higher. That is, set the protection level as  
where is given by \(2.11\). One then repeats this same calculation  
for each stage  
EMSR-a is certainly simple and has an intuitive appeal. For a short  
while it was even believed to be optimal, but this notion was quickly  
dispelled once the published work on optimal controls appeared.  
Indeed, it is not hard to see intuitively that EMSR-a can be exces-  
sively conservative and produce protection levels that are larger than  
optimal in certain cases. This is because adding the individual protec-  
tion levels ignores the statistical averaging effect *\(pooling effect\)*  
produced by aggregating demand across classes. For example, for the  
sake of illustration, suppose that at stage all future demand has  
the same revenue, i.e., Then EMSR-a will set  
protection levels so that  
However, it is clear that all these future classes should be aggregated  
since they have identical revenues, in which case we can apply Little-  
wood’s rule \(2.2\) to obtain the optimal protection level, using *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 47  
Since for any random variables and any numbers  
the optimal protection level is less than the EMSR-a protection level,  
6 This behavior suggests that EMSR-a may perform badly  
when there are large numbers of classes whose revenues are close to-  
gether.  
**2.2.4.2 EMSR-b**  
EMSR-b \(*expected marginal seat revenue–version* \) is an alternative  
single-resource heuristic that avoids the lack-of-pooling defect in EMSR-  
a mentioned above. EMSR-b is again based on an approximation that  
reduces the problem at each stage to two classes, but in contrast to  
EMSR-a, the approximation is based on aggregating *demand* rather  
than aggregating *protection levels.* Specifically, the demand from fu-  
ture classes is aggregated and treated as one class with a revenue equal  
to the weighted-average revenue.  
Consider stage in which we want to determine protection level  
Define the aggregated future demand for classes by  
and let the weighted-average revenue from classes be defined by  
denoted  
Then the EMSR-b protection level for class by Littlewood’s rule \(2.2\) so that  
and higher, is chosen  
It is common when using EMSR-b to assume demand for each class is  
independent and normally distributed with mean and variance in  
6To see this, consider a sample realization of demand, and note that if  
then for at least one but the converse need not be true. So the  
probability of the event of the probabilities of the events  
cannot exceed the sum \(over \) 48 which case  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where is the mean and is the variance of the  
aggregated demand to come at stage and  
\(recall is the inverse of the standard normal c.d.f.\). Again, one  
repeats this calculation for each \(See Section 11.A for approximation  
formulas for the normal and inverse normal distributions.\)  
EMSR-b clearly captures the *pooling*—or *statistical averaging*—effect  
that is lacking in EMSR-a. This is an advantage of EMSR-b over EMSR-  
a. However, using the weighted-average revenue is a somewhat crude ap-  
proximation that can distort the resulting protection levels. In practice  
EMSR-b is more popular and seems to generally perform better than  
EMSR-a, though studies comparing the two have at times shown mixed  
results. Belobaba \[41\] reports studies in which EMSR-b is consistently  
within 0.5 percent of the optimal revenue, whereas EMSR-a can deviate  
by nearly 1.5 percent from the optimal revenue in certain cases, though  
with mixed order of arrival and frequent reoptimization, he reports that  
both methods perform well. However, another recent study by Polt \[425\]  
using Lufthansa airline data showed more mixed performance, with nei-  
ther method dominating the other.  
**2.2.4.3 Numerical Examples**  
A few simple numerical examples give some sense of the protection  
levels and revenues produced by these two approximations. The example  
we consider is based on a slightly modified instance of the data reported  
by Wollmer \[576\]\:  
**Example 2.3** There are four classes, and demand is assumed to be normally distrib-  
uted. Table 2.1 shows the demand data and Table 2.2 the protection levels produced  
by EMSR-a, EMSR-b, and the optimal policy. *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 49  
Note from Table 2.1 that \(in this example\) there is a considerable  
discrepancy between the protection levels computed under the heuristics,  
both compared with each other and with the optimal protection levels.  
The revenue performance of the methods from a simulation study are  
shown in Table 2.2. Capacity is varied from 80 to 150 to create demand  
factors \(ratio of total mean demand to capacity\) in the range 1.7 to  
0.9\. The percentage suboptimality is also reported \(one minus the ratio  
of heuristic revenues to optimal revenues\). Note for this example that  
EMSR-a is slightly better than EMSR-b, though both perform quite  
well; the suboptimality gap of EMSR-b reaches a high of 0.52%, while  
the maximum suboptimality of EMSR-a is only 0.30%.  
**Example 2.4** The demand statistics are the same as in Example 2.3, but the revenue  
values are more evenly spaced. The data and resulting protection levels are shown in  
Tables 2.3 and 2.4.  
The revenue performance of the heuristics in Example 2.4 is shown in  
Table 2.4. In this case, there is less discrepancy among the protection  
levels computed under the heuristics and the optimal policy. The per-  
formance of both heuristics is also very good, especially under EMSR-b,  
which is for all practical purposes optimal. Performance such as this  
helps explain why these heuristics are popular in practice. 50 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**2.3 Adaptive Methods**  
We next examine an adaptive algorithm for determining optimal pro-  
tection levels for the static, single-resource model of Section 2.2.2. The  
optimal protection levels in this case are determined by the conditions  
\(2.8\). Typically, application of the optimality conditions \(2.8\) requires  
three steps. First, historical demand data are studied to determine suit-  
able models for the demand distributions. Second, forecasting techniques  
are applied to estimate the parameters of these distributions. Third, the  
forecasts are passed to an optimization routine that solves for protec-  
tion levels The resulting controls are then used to make individual  
accept or deny decisions as reservations come in. In practice, bookings  
from similar resources are fed back into the forecasting system, and the  
process is repeated cyclically over time.  
In this section, we look at a method for *directly* updating booking pol-  
icy parameters for the next resource usage based on observations of the  
performance of the parameters on previous instances, without recourse  
to the complex cycles of forecasting and optimization. We show how  
to construct a simple adjustment scheme of this sort that is based on  
stochastic approximation methods \(the Robbins-Monro algorithm \[443\]\)  
and that provably converges to an optimal policy with repeated ap-  
plication. The convergence, however, is guaranteed only for the case  
of stationary, independent demand and may be quite slow, requiring a  
large number of adjustments to reach a near-optimal set of protection  
levels.  
**2.3.1 Adaptive Algorithm**  
Our starting point in developing an adaptive algorithm is condition  
\(2.9\), which states that for to be an optimal set of protection levels, *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 51  
it must satisfy  
For example, if the revenue ratio is 0.6, then this condition says  
that the fill event defined by \(2.8\) should occur on 60% of the  
service instances, on average, if Note that it is easy to determine  
the frequency of the fill events from historical records, since it  
is necessary only to observe if demand reached the protection levels, not  
the degree to which it exceeded them.7  
To develop the algorithm, for define  
where **1**\(*E*\) denotes the indicator function of event *E* \(a function that is  
1 if event *E* occurs and is zero otherwise\). The quantity will be  
negative if the fill event occurs and positive otherwise. If protection  
levels are being adjusted, an occurrence of the fill event \(all of classes  
1 through reached their protection levels\) suggests that the protection  
level should be adjusted upward. Thus – can be viewed  
as an *adjustment direction* for protection level The corresponding  
*adjustment vector* is Define  
and let Thus, – **h**\(**y**\) can be properly  
viewed as the *expected adjustment vector* for protection levels given cur-  
rent levels **y**. The optimality condition \(2.9\) stipulates that we should  
seek a such that the expected adjustment for all protection levels is  
zero; or,  
The Robbins-Monro \[443\] algorithm \(generalized for vector quantities\)  
constructs a sequence of parameter estimates, sequence of independent instances, from a  
using the recursion  
7There are two important exceptions to this statement. First, if happens to exceed the  
maximum number of seats available for sale \(usually the physical capacity plus an overbooking  
*pad*\), then the event is not observable \(unless the rejected sales are  
recorded\). Second, if protection levels are revised during the booking period prior to the  
usage of the resource, it can easily happen that a new protection level exceeds the *remaining*  
capacity \(a problem similar to the first one\) that earlier, high protection levels constrained  
demand during part of the booking period in one or more discount classes. In this case, total  
demand is not observed \(a variant of censorship of the demand data\). 52  
where *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
is a sequence of nonnegative step sizes satisfying  
The simplest example of a suitable step size sequence is defined by  
however, this simple averaging sequence takes small steps early in the  
procedure, which can delay convergence. In the development to follow,  
we use a sequence of the form where and are constants  
chosen to give larger early steps.  
The directions can be determined after the completion  
of each instance \(each departure in the airline case\). If the fill event  
occurs, and the protection level is increased by  
if not, then and is reduced by  
Thus protection levels are stepped up when high demand is observed and  
stepped down when low demand is observed, with the step size becoming  
smaller as the algorithm progresses.  
Some relatively mild regularity conditions ensure that the procedure  
\(2.15\) does converge \(a.s.\) to a value satisfying \(See van  
Ryzin and McGill \[526\] for exact conditions as well as bounds on the  
rate of convergence.\)  
**2.3.2 A Numerical Comparison with EMSR and**  
# Censored Forecasting  
We next look at a brief numerical example of the performance of the  
adaptive algorithm compared with a procedure that combines censored  
forecasting with EMSR-b protection levels. These comparisons are based  
on simulated data in an idealized stationary setting, but do provide some  
insight into the performance of each method.  
The combined forecasting/EMSR-b \(F/EMSR\) scheme constructs a  
demand forecast from censored data based on the Kaplan-Meier esti-  
mator of the survivor function \(See Section 9.4.3.\)  
Protection levels are set using EMSR-b.  
The test problem has four classes \(three protection levels\). Demand is  
modeled using a normal distribution. The distribution data, along with  
optimal and EMSR-b protection levels, are shown in Table 2.5. The  
protection level is the optimal level when demand is normally distrib-  
uted, while is the protection level computed by the  
heuristic. To illustrate convergence, starting protection levels are set far  
from optimal, corresponding to cases of very high and very low starting  
values \(Table 2.6\). There are two demand scenarios. The high-demand  
scenario has a starting inventory of 124 seats, corresponding to a 125%  
demand factor \(ratio of expected total demand to capacity\) and approx- *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 53  
imately a 95% load factor \(ratio of average number of seats sold to ca-  
pacity\) under optimal protection levels. The low-demand scenario starts  
with 164 seats, resulting in a demand factor of 95% and a load factor of  
approximately 90% under optimal protection levels. For the stochastic  
approximation procedure, the step size sequence is  
Figure 2.4 shows three graphs of the data for the case of low demand  
and high starting values. The top graph of Figure 2.4 shows the average  
cumulative revenue as a percentage of the optimal revenue for the two  
methods as a function of the number of iterations \(flights\). The error  
bars show the 95% confidence intervals about these averages. The mid-  
dle graph shows the average protection levels over time for the stochastic  
approximation \(SA\) procedure. The horizontal dotted lines are the op-  
timal protection levels. The lowest line corresponds to the middle  
line to and the top line to The solid lines are the correspond-  
ing average protection levels produced by the stochastic approximation  
\(SA\) method. The error bars on the solid lines give the 25-percentile  
and 75-percentile values for each protection level at each iteration, which  
provides some sense of the variability in protection levels across sample  
paths. The bottom graph shows the identical plot of protection levels  
for the F/EMSR method.  
Figure 2.4 shows that the F/EMSR procedure converges more quickly  
than the SA procedure. In this case, the faster convergence of the  
F/EMSR has a significant impact on the cumulative revenue perfor-  
mance\: F/EMSR generates about 2 to 3% higher revenue on average in  
the early iterations. With low demand and low starting values, the two  
methods perform comparably. 54 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT* *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 55 56  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The results are quite different in the high demand factor case. Fig-  
ure 2.5 shows the simulation results for low starting protection values  
and high load factor. Note, as indicated by the error bars in the bottom  
graphs, that the F/EMSR procedure is very volatile and somewhat slow  
to converge in the early iterations. The revenue effect of this behavior is  
quite significant, with F/EMSR generating cumulative revenues roughly  
8% lower than optimal and 2 to 3% lower than SA in the early iterations.  
However, the performance and protection levels of F/EMSR improve af-  
ter about 30 iterations. In contrast, the SA procedure is considerably  
more stable, and it converges faster in the early iterations, which ac-  
counts for its superior revenue performance. F/EMSR performs badly  
in this case because the forecasting procedure suffers from the frequent  
censoring caused by a combination of low protection levels and high de-  
mand. For high starting protection levels, the F/EMSR performs better,  
since there is less initial censoring of data.  
This behavior suggests that adaptive methods may be useful as a  
means of automatically adjusting protection levels in cases where very  
little demand information is available \(such as with new products\) and  
forecasting is difficult due to a high degree of censoring. In such cases,  
adaptive methods provide a robust way to adjust protection levels and  
may also help speed up the forecasting method itself by nudging pro-  
tection levels in the right direction, thereby reducing the amount of  
censoring.  
**2.4 Group Arrivals**  
Group arrivals can pose additional complications. A group request is  
a single request for multiple units of capacity \(such as a family of four  
traveling together\). We briefly describe this case but omit any detailed  
formulations because the basic ideas follow readily from what we have  
seen thus far \(and the more complicated ideas are beyond the scope of  
this text\).  
If groups can be *partially accepted*—that is, given a request for  
units, we can sell any quantity in the range \(and more  
important, the customer is willing to buy any amount in this range,  
something that is not unusual among tour operators\)—then there is  
little impact on the single-resource models discussed above. Indeed, the  
static model \(2.3\) can be thought of as a group model where in each  
period one “large group” of size arrives because we can sell units,  
where and is the total available capacity. Thus,  
with groups that can be partially accepted, we need only to keep track of  
the aggregate demand for each class and the formulations are essentially  
the same as those of the static case in Section 2.2.2. *Single-Resource Capacity Control*  
57  
The real complication in group arrivals occurs when groups must be  
accepted on an *all-or-none* basis—that is, given a request for units  
we can sell only all units or none at all. This seemingly modest change  
has a profound impact on the structure of optimal allocation policies.  
First, we must specify the distribution of group sizes to model how much  
demand we have from groups of various sizes. But this in itself does not  
pose too much of a theoretical difficulty. The bigger problem is that the  
value function may not be concave \(the marginal value of capacity may  
in fact increase\), so using booking limits, protection levels, or bid prices  
may not be optimal.  
An example illustrates what can go wrong. Consider a static model  
with only two stages. Suppose that in the last stage \(stage  
only groups of size two arrive. In the first stage \(stage groups  
of varying sizes can arrive. Now suppose that we have units of  
capacity remaining. Note the marginal value of the last unit of capacity  
in stage 1 is zero; that is, because we only  
get demand for groups of size 2 in the last stage, and therefore having  
only one unit of capacity is of no value. On the other hand, provided  
we have some positive probability of demand for a group of size 2 in  
stage 1, then the second unit of capacity will have a positive marginal  
value; that is, Hence, the marginal value  
of capacity is no longer decreasing in As a result, in first  
stage it can be optimal to reject a request for a single unit of some class  
when there are two units of capacity remaining but optimal to accept  
the same request when there is only one unit of capacity remaining. So  
the notion that there is a booking limit above which we will not sell to  
a class is no longer valid.  
Essentially, the requirement to completely accept or reject groups cre-  
ates a combinatorial *\(bin-packing\)* phenomenon in allocating capacity.  
The resulting nonmonotone value function means that optimal policies  
are considerably more complex than in the case where groups can be  
partially accepted. Intuitively, one might expect that if a sufficiently  
large fraction of demand is from small groups \(size one or two\) and the  
capacities are reasonably large, then these combinatorial effects could be  
ignored and the nongroup models may be a good approximation. This  
is the implicit assumption in most single-resource RM systems used in  
practice.  
**2.5 Dynamic Models**  
Dynamic models relax the assumption that the demand for classes  
arrives in a strict low-to-high revenue order. Instead, they allow for an  
arbitrary order of arrival, with the possibility of interspersed arrivals of 58  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
several classes. While at first this seems like a strict generalization of  
the static case, the dynamic models require the assumption of Markovian  
\(such as Poisson\) arrivals to make them tractable. This puts restrictions  
on modeling different levels of variability in demand. Indeed, this limi-  
tation on the distribution of demand is the main drawback of dynamic  
models in practice. In addition, dynamic models require an estimate of  
the pattern of arrivals over time \(called the *booking curve*\)*,* which may  
be difficult to estimate in certain applications. Thus, the choice of dy-  
namic versus static models essentially comes down to a choice of which  
set of approximations is more acceptable and what data is available in  
any given application.  
Other assumptions of the static model are retained. Demand is as-  
sumed independent between classes and over time and also independent  
of the capacity controls. The firm is again assumed to be risk-neutral.  
The justifications \(or criticisms\) for these assumptions are the same as  
in the static-model case.  
**2.5.1 Formulation and Structural Properties**  
In the simplest dynamic model, we have classes as before with as-  
sociated prices There are *T* total periods and  
indexes the periods, with the time index running forward is the  
first period, and is the last period; this is in contrast to the sta-  
tic dynamic program, where the stages run from to 1 in the dynamic  
programming recursion\). Since there is no longer a one-to-one corre-  
spondence between periods and classes, we use separate for  
periods and for classes.  
In each period we assume, by a sufficiently fine discretization of time,  
that at most one arrival occurs.8 The probability of an arrival of class  
in period is denoted The assumption of at most one arrival per  
period implies that we must have  
In general, the periods need not be of the same duration. For example,  
early in the booking process when demand is low we might use a period of  
several days whereas during periods of peak booking activity we might  
use a period of less than an hour. Note also the arrival probabilities  
may vary with so the mix of classes that arrive may vary over time. In  
8 The assumption of one arrival per period can be generalized as shown by Lautenbacher and  
Stidham \[330\], but both theoretically and computationally it is a convenient assumption. *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 59  
particular, we do not require lower classes to arrive earlier than higher  
classes.  
**2.5.1.1 Dynamic Program**  
As before, let denote the remaining capacity and denote the  
value function in period Let be a random variable, with  
if a demand for class arrives in period and otherwise. Note  
that Let if we accept the arrival \(if there  
has been one\) and otherwise. \(We suppress the period subscript  
of the control as it should be clear from the context.\) We want to  
maximize the sum of current revenue and the revenue to go, or  
The Bellman equation is therefore  
where of capacity in period is the expected marginal value  
The boundary conditions are 9  
and  
**2.5.2 Optimal Policy**  
An immediate consequence of \(2.17\) is that if a class request arrives,  
so that then it is optimal to accept the request if and only if  
Thus, the optimal control can be implemented using a bid-price control  
where the bid price is equal to the marginal value,  
9The second boundary condition can be eliminated if we use the control constraint  
instead of However, it is simpler conceptually and notationally to  
use the boundary conditions instead. 60 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Revenues that exceed this threshold are accepted; those that do not are  
rejected.  
As in the static case, an important property of the value function is  
that it has decreasing marginal value \(See  
Appendix 2.A for proof.\)

This theorem is natural and intuitive since one would expect the value  
of additional capacity at any point in time to have a decreasing marginal  
benefit and the marginal value at any given remaining capacity to de-  
crease with time \(because as time elapses, there are fewer opportunities  
to sell the capacity\).  
As a consequence, the optimization on the right-hand side of \(2.17\)  
can also be implemented as a nested-allocation policy, albeit one that  
has time-varying protection levels \(or booking limits\). Specifically, we  
can define time-dependent optimal protection levels  
that have the usual interpretation that is the capacity we protect  
for classes Then the protection levels are nested,  
and it is optimal to accept class if and only if  
the remaining capacity exceeds The situation is illustrated in  
Figure 2.6.  
Time-dependent nested booking limits can also be defined as before  
by  
That the booking limits and protection levels depend on time in this case  
essentially stems from the fact that the demand to come varies with time  
in the dynamic model. The change in demand to come as time evolves  
effects the opportunity cost and therefore the resulting booking limit  
and protection levels.  
As a practical matter, because the value function is not likely to  
change much over short periods of time, fixing the protection levels or  
booking limits computed by a dynamic model and updating them peri-  
odically \(as is done in most RM systems in practice\) is usually close to  
optimal. Still, the time-varying nature of the protection levels remains  
a key distinction between static and dynamic models.  
We summarize these results in the following theorem\: *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 61  
THEOREM 2.2 For *the dynamic model defined by \(2.17\), the optimal*  
*control can be achieved using either\:*  
*\(i\) Time-dependent nested protection levels defined by \(2.19\),*  
*\(ii\) Time-dependent nested booking limits defined by \(2.20\), or*  
*\(iii\) Bid-price tables defined by \(2.18\).*  
**2.5.2.1 Computation**  
Computationally, the dynamic model is solved by substituting the  
optimal policy into \(2.17\). This yields the recursion  
Starting with the boundary condition we proceed  
with the recursion backward in time Each stage requires  
operations, so the overall complexity is Usually, the value of *T*  
is *O*\(*C*\) because in most practical problems the total expected demand is  
the same magnitude as the capacity and the periods are typically chosen  
so that there is *O*\(1\) arrival per period. So the complexity in terms of 62  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and *C* is approximately dynamic program for the static model.  
which is the same as that of the  
**2.6 Customer-Choice Behavior**  
A key assumption in the models that we have described thus far is  
that demand for each of the classes is completely independent of the  
capacity controls being applied by the seller. That is, it is assumed  
that the likelihood of receiving a request for any given class does not  
depend on which other classes are available at the time of the request.  
Needless to say, this is a somewhat unrealistic assumption. For example,  
in the airline case the likelihood of selling a full-fare ticket may very well  
depend on whether a discount fare is available at the same time and the  
likelihood that a customer buys at all may depend on the lowest available  
fare. When customers buy a higher fare when a discount is closed it is  
called *buy-up* \(from the firm’s point of view, this is also called *sell-up*\);  
when they choose another flight when a discount is closed it is called  
*diversion.*  
Clearly, such customer behavior could have important RM conse-  
quences and ought to be considered when making control decisions.  
We next look at some heuristic and exact methods for incorporating  
customer-choice behavior in single-resource problems.  
**2.6.1 Buy-Up Factors**  
One approach to modeling customer-choice behavior that works with  
the two-class model is to include buy-up probabilities—also called *buy-up*  
*factors*—in the formulation.  
The approach works as follows. Consider the simple two-class static  
model, and recall that Littlewood’s rule \(2.2\) \(slightly restated\) is to  
accept demand from class 2 if and only if  
where is the remaining capacity—that is, if the revenue from accepting  
class 2 exceeds the marginal value of the unit of capacity required to  
satisfy the request. Now suppose that there is a probability that a  
customer for class 2 will buy class 1 if class 2 is closed. The net benefit  
of accepting the request is still the same, but now rather than losing the  
request when we reject it, there is some chance the customer will buy  
up to class 1. If so, we earn a net benefit of \(the  
class 1 revenue minus the expected marginal cost\). Thus, it is optimal  
to accept class 2 now if or  
equivalently if *Single-Resource Capacity Control*  
63  
Note that the right-hand side of the modified rule \(2.22\) is strictly larger  
than the right-hand side in Littlewood’s rule \(2.21\), which means that  
the modified rule \(2.22\) is more likely to reject class 2 demand. This is  
intuitive because with the possibility of customers upgrading to class 1,  
we should be more eager to close class 2.  
The difficulty with this approach is that it does not extend to more  
than two classes—at least not in an exact way—because the probability  
that a customer buys class given that class is closed depends not only  
on and but also on which other classes are also available. In other  
words, with more than two classes the customer faces a *multinomial*  
choice rather than a *binary* choice.  
However, one can at least heuristically extend the buy-up factor idea  
to EMSR-a or EMSR-b because these heuristics approximate the multi-  
class problem using the two-class model.  
For example, EMSR-b can be extended to allow for a buy-up factor by  
modifying the equation for determining the protection level \(2.14\),  
as follows\:  
where is the probability that a customer of class buys up to  
one of the classes is the weighted-average revenue from  
these classes as defined by \(2.13\); and is an estimate of the  
average revenue received given that a class customer buys up to  
one of the classes \(for example, if customers are  
assumed to buy up to the next-highest price class\). Again, the net result  
of this change is to increase the protection level and close down class  
earlier than one would do under the traditional EMSR-b rule.10  
While this modification to EMSR-b provides a simple heuristic way to  
incorporate choice behavior, it is a somewhat ad hoc adjustment to an  
already heuristic approach to the problem. Beyond the limitations of the  
model and its assumptions, there are some serious difficulties involved  
in estimating the buy-up factors. Indeed, in current applications of the  
model, they are often simply made-up, reasonable-sounding numbers.  
Moreover, the assumptions of the model can clash with unconstrain-  
ing and recapture procedures that are subsequently applied, resulting  
in double counting of demand. Despite these limitations, buy-up fac-  
tors have proved useful as a rough-cut approach for incorporating choice  
behavior in practice.  
10That it increases the protection level about the usual EMSR-b value can be seen by noting  
that in the usual EMSR-b case and thus, has to  
increase to satisfy the equality \(2.23\). 64  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**2.6.2 Discrete-Choice Models**  
We next look at a single-resource problem in which customer-choice  
behavior is explicitly modeled using a general discrete-choice model. In  
contrast to the heuristic approach of buy-up factors, this model provides  
a more theoretically sound approach to incorporating choice behavior.  
It also provides insights into how choice behavior affects the optimal  
availability controls. The theory is first developed for the general choice  
model case and then applied to some special demand models.  
**2.6.2.1 Model Definition**  
As in the traditional dynamic model of Section 2.5, time is discrete  
and indexed by with the indices running forward in time is the  
period of resource usage\). In each period there is at most one arrival.  
The probability of arrival is denoted by which we assume, for ease of  
exposition, is the same for all time-periods There are classes, and we  
let denote the entire set of classes. We let choice index  
0 denote the no-purchase choice; that is, the event that the customer  
does not purchase any of the classes offered. Each class has an  
associated price and without loss of generality we index classes so  
that We let denote the revenue of the  
no-purchase choice.  
Customer purchase behavior is modeled as follows. In each period  
the seller chooses a subset of classes to offer. When the  
set of classes is offered in period the probability that a customer  
chooses class is denoted denotes the no-purchase  
probability.  
The probability that a sale of class is made in period is therefore  
and the probability that no sale is made is  
Note that this last expression reflects the fact that having no sales in a  
period could be due either to no arrival at all or an arrival that does not  
purchase. This leads to an incomplete-data problem when estimating  
the model, as discussed in Section 9.4.1.2.  
The only condition we impose on the choice probabilities is that  
they define a proper probability function. That is, for every set  
the probabilities satisfy *Single-Resource Capacity Control*  
65  
This includes most choice models of practical interest \(see Ben-Akiva and  
Lerman \[48\]\) and even some rather pathological cases.  
11 The following  
running example will be used to illustrate the model and analysis\:  
**Example 2.5** An airline offers three fare products—*Y, M*, and *K.* These products  
differ in terms of revenues and conditions as shown in Table 2.7. The airline has  
five segments of customers—two business segments and three leisure segments. The  
segments differ in terms of the restrictions that they qualify for and the fares they are  
willing to pay. The data describing each segment are given in Table 2.8. The second  
column of Table 2.8 gives the probability that an arriving customer is from each given  
segment.  
Given this data for Example 2.5, the first four columns of Table 2.9  
give the choice probabilities that would result.12  
11For example, some psychologists have shown that customers can be overwhelmed by more  
choices, and they may become more reluctant to purchase as more options are offered \(see  
Iyengar and Lepper \(265\)\). Such cases would be covered by a suitable choice of that  
results in the total probability of purchase, being decreasing in *S.*  
12To see how the probabilities in Table 2.9 are derived, consider the set *S* = \{*Y, K*\}*.* If  
*S* = \{*Y,K*\} is offered, segments Business 1 and Business 2 buy the *Y* fare because they  
cannot qualify for both the SA stay and 21-day advance-purchase restrictions on *K,* so  
Similarly, Leisure 1 cannot qualify for the SA stay restriction of *K* and  
is not willing to purchase *Y,* so these customers do not purchase at all. Segments Leisure 2 and  
3, however, qualify for both restrictions on *K* and purchase *K.* Hence,  
Class *M* is not offered, so The other rows of Table 2.9 are filled out similarly. 66  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
This particular method of generating choice probabilities is only for  
illustration. Other choice models could be used and in general any proper  
set of probabilities could be used to populate Table 2.9.  
**2.6.2.2 Formulation**  
As before, let *C* denote the total capacity, *T* the number of time-  
periods, the current period, and the number of remaining inventory  
units. Define the value function as the maximum expected revenue  
obtainable from periods given that there are inventory  
units remaining at time Then the Bellman equation for is  
where denotes the marginal cost of  
capacity in the next period, and we have used the fact that for all *S*,  
The boundary conditions are  
Note one key difference in this formulation compared to our analysis  
of the traditional independent-class models of Section 2.2.2 and Sec-  
tion 2.5—we assume the seller *precommits* to the open set of classes *S* *Single-Resource Capacity Control*  
67  
in each period, while in the traditional models, we assume the seller ob-  
serves the class of the request and then makes an accept or deny decision  
based on the class. The reason for the difference is that in the traditional  
models the class of an arriving request is completely independent of the  
controls, so it doesn’t matter whether we precommit to the set of open  
classes or not. However, in the choice-based model, the class that an  
arriving customer chooses depends \(through the choice model on  
which classes *S* we report as being open. Hence, the formulation \(2.24\)  
reflects this fact \(we are taking max *E*\[·\] in 2.24 instead of E\[max\(·\)\]\);  
we must choose *S* prior to seeing the realization of the choice decision.  
**2.6.2.3 Structure of the Optimal Policy**  
The problem \(2.24\) at first seems to have very little structure, but  
a sequence of simplifications provides a good characterization of the  
optimal policy. The first simplification is to write \(2.24\) in more compact  
form as  
where  
denotes the total probability of purchase, and  
denotes the total expected revenue from offering set *S.* Table 2.9 gives  
the values *Q*\(*S*\) and *R*\(*S*\) for our Example 2.5. For theoretical purposes,  
we also consider allowing the seller to randomize over the sets *S* that  
are offered at the beginning of each time-period, but this relaxation is  
not strictly needed since there is always at least one set *S* that achieves  
the maximum in \(2.26\).  
The second simplification is to note that not all subsets need  
to be considered when maximizing the right-hand side of \(2.26\). Indeed,  
the search can be reduced to only those sets that are efficient as defined  
below\:  
DEFINITION 2.1 *A set T is said to be **inefficient** if there exist proba-*  
*bilities with such that*  
*A set is said to be **efficient** if no such probabilities exist.* 68  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
In words, a set *T* is inefficient if we can use a randomization of other  
sets *S* to produce an expected revenue that is strictly greater than *R*\(*T*\)  
with no increase in the probability of purchase *Q*\(*T*\)*.*  
The significance of inefficient sets is that they can be eliminated from  
consideration\:  
PROPOSITION 2.3 *An inefficient set is never an optimal solution to*  
*\(2.24\).*  
The proof is omitted, but the fact that such sets should be eliminated  
from consideration is quite intuitive from \(2.26\); an inefficient set *T*  
provides strictly less revenue *R*\(*T*\) than do other sets and incurs at least  
as high a probability of consuming capacity *Q*\(*T*\) \(and hence incurs at  
least as high an opportunity cost in \(2.26\)\).  
For Example 2.5, Table 2.9 shows which sets are efficient—namely, the  
sets \{*Y*\}*,* \{*Y,K*\}*,* and \{*Y,K,M*\}*.* That these sets are efficient follows  
from inspection of Figure 2.7, which shows a scatter plot of the values  
*Q*\(*S*\) and *R*\(*S*\) for all subsets *S.* Note from this figure and Definition 2.1  
that an efficient set is a point that is on the “efficient frontier” of the set  
of points \{*Q*\(*S*\)*, R*\(*S*\)\}, Here, “efficiency” is with respect to the  
tradeoff between expected revenue *R*\(*S*\) and probability of sale *Q*\(*S*\)*.*  
The third simplification is to note that the efficient sets can be easily  
ordered. Indeed, let denote the number of efficient sets. These sets can  
be indexed such that both the revenues and probabilities of  
purchase are monotone increasing in the index. That is, if the collection  
of efficient sets is indexed such that  
then as well. The proof of this fact is  
again omitted, but it is easy to see intuitively from Figure 2.7. Note from  
Table 2.9 that there are efficient sets \{*Y*\}*,* \{*Y, K*\}*,* and \{*Y, K, M*\}*.*  
These can be ordered and with  
associated probabilities of purchase and and  
prices and as claimed.  
Henceforth, we assume the efficient sets are denoted and  
are indexed in increasing revenue and probability order. Also, to simplify  
notation we let and and note and are  
both increasing in So the Bellman equation can be further simplified  
to  
The final simplification is to show that when expressed in terms of the  
sequence of efficient sets, the optimal policy has a simple  
form as stated in the following theorem\: *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 69  
THEOREM 2.3 *An optimal policy for \(2.24\) is to select a set from*  
*among the efficient, ordered sets that maximizes*  
*\(2.27\). Moreover, for a fixed the largest optimal index is increasing*  
*in the remaining capacity and for any fixed is increasing in time*  
The proof of this theorem is involved but derives from the fact that  
the marginal value is decreasing in \(see Appendix 2.A for  
a proof\) and the fact that the optimal index is decreasing in this  
marginal value.  
This characterization is significant for several reasons. First, it shows  
that the optimal sets can be reduced to only those that are efficient,  
which in many cases significantly reduces the number of sets we need  
to consider. Moreover, it shows that this limited number of sets can be  
sequenced in a natural way and that the more capacity we have \(or the  
less time remaining\), the higher the set we should use in this sequence.  
For example, applying Theorem 2.3 to Example 2.5, we see that the  
efficient sets and would be  
used as follows. With very large amounts of capacity remaining, is  
optimal\: all three fare classes are opened. As capacity is consumed, at 70  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
some point we switch to only offering class *M* is closed, and only  
*Y* and *K* are offered. As capacity is reduced further, at some point we  
close class *K* and offer only class *Y* \(set is used\).  
Note what’s odd here; it can be optimal to offer the highest fare *Y* and  
the lowest fare *K,* but not the middle fare *M.* This is because opening *M*  
causes some buy-down from *Y* to *M*, whereas *K* is sufficiently restricted  
to prevent buy-down. Only when capacity is plentiful is *M* opened.  
**2.6.2.4 Identifying Efficient Sets**  
Finding the efficient sets is, in general, computationally complex. The  
naive approach is to enumerate all subsets of and for each set  
*T* solve a linear program \(in variables to test for efficiency  
using the conditions in Definition 2.1.  
However, a more efficient alternative is to use the following *largest*  
*marginal revenue* procedure. First, let Then successive sets can  
be found by the following recursion. Let be the efficient set. Then  
the efficient set, is found by checking among the sets *S*  
with and for the one that maximizes the  
marginal revenue ratio  
\(Note that this is simply the increase in expected revenue per unit in-  
crease in expected demand.\) The procedure starts with and stops  
as soon as no sets *S* with and exist; it re-  
turns the complete sequence Since there are subsets  
to check at each step, the recursion has complexity where  
is the number of efficient sets \(which in the worst case could be  
itself\).  
For small numbers of classes, this largest marginal revenue procedure  
is practical, especially since it can be performed off line. But it is still  
exponential in the number of classes For large numbers of classes,  
heuristic or analytic approaches can be used to reduce the complexity  
of identifying efficient sets. For example, one could enumerate a limited  
collection of subsets *S* rather than all subsets and apply the largest  
marginal revenue procedure to determine which subsets in the collection  
are efficient relative to other sets in the collection. In some special cases,  
as shown below, one can identify which subsets are efficient analytically,  
thus eliminating the need to enumerate all possible subsets. *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 71  
**2.6.2.5 Optimality of Nested-Allocation Policies**  
The optimization results above also have important implications for  
the optimality of nested-allocation policies. Indeed, Definition 2.1 and  
Theorem 2.3 can be used to provide a complete characterization of cases  
in which nested-allocation polices are optimal. They also can be used to  
provide conditions under which the optimal nesting is by revenue order.  
We begin with a precise definition of a nested-allocation policy in the  
context of the choice model\:  
DEFINITION 2.2 *A control policy is called a **nested policy** if there is*  
*an increasing family of subsets and an index*  
*that is increasing in such that set is chosen at time when the*  
*remaining capacity is*  
Though this is a somewhat abstract definition of a nested policy, it is  
in fact a natural generalization of nested allocations from the traditional  
single-resource models of Section 2.2.2 and 2.5 and implies an ordering  
of the classes based on when they first appear in the increasing sequence  
of sets That is, class is considered “higher” than class in the  
nesting order if class appears earlier in the sequence. Returning to  
Example 2.5, we see that the efficient sets are indeed nested according  
to this definition because and  
are increasing. Class *Y* would be considered the highest in the nested  
order, followed by class *K* and then class *M*.  
If the optimal policy is nested in this sense, then we can define opti-  
mal protection levels such that classes lower in the  
nesting order than those in are closed if the remaining capacity is less  
than just as in the traditional single-resource case. The optimal  
protection levels for are defined by  
Nested booking limits can also be defined in the usual way,  
We again return to Example 2.5 to illustrate this concept. Table 2.10  
shows the objective function value for each of the  
three efficient sets for a particular marginal value function  
which we assume is given in this example. Capacities are in  
the range The last column of Table 2.10 gives the index,  
of the efficient set that is optimal for each capacity  
Note that for capacities 1,2, and 3, the set is the optimal  
set, so class *Y* is the only open fare. Once we reach 4 units of remaining  
capacity, set becomes optimal and we open class *K* in  
addition to class *Y*. When the remaining capacity reaches 13, set 72  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
\{*Y*, *K*, *M*\} becomes optimal, and we open *M* in addition to *Y* and *K.*  
As a result, the optimal protection level for set is and the  
protection level for set is has a protection level equal to  
capacity.  
**2.6.2.6 Nesting by Revenue Order**  
Revenues provide a natural nesting ordering, and, as described ear-  
lier in this chapter, this is traditionally how most quantity-based RM  
systems have been conceived and implemented. From a practical stand-  
point, therefore, it is important to understand when a particular choice  
model leads to nesting by revenue order. Yet Example 2.5 makes clear  
that nesting by revenue order need not be the optimal policy in general.  
Talluri and van Ryzin \[500\] provide conditions that guarantee a given  
choice model will always have this property. The results show, for ex-  
ample, why the optimal control for the traditional independent-demand  
model is nested by revenue order. Talluri and van Ryzin \[500\] also show  
that if the choice probabilities follow the multinomial-logit \(MNL\) choice  
model \(See Section 7.2.2.3.\), then the optimal policy is always nested by *Single-Resource Capacity Control* 73  
revenue order. A similar result holds if customers’ choice behavior is such  
that they always buy the lowest-price open class. However, in general  
nesting by revenue order need not be optimal.  
**2.6.2.7 Comparisons of Optimality Conditions**  
The optimality conditions in the nested-by-revenue-order case also  
provide some intuition into how choice-based controls differ from tra-  
ditional controls. Let denote the set of the highest  
classes \(in revenue order\). Then one can show it is optimal to open class  
if and only if  
where  
is the change \(usually an increase for most choice models\) in purchase  
probability for class as the result of *not* offering class This  
expression is intuitive\: The left-hand side is the probability of selling  
class times the “net gain” from selling it; that is, the revenue we  
get from class minus the opportunity cost, of using a  
unit of capacity. The right-hand side is the net gain \(loss\) among the  
other classes caused by eliminating \(adding\) class \(the sum over  
all the other class in of the change in purchase probability times  
the net gain from selling Therefore, the condition \(2.28\) simply says  
that if the expected gain on class exceeds the incremental loss on  
the other classes caused by adding then it pays to open  
otherwise, should be closed.  
The expression \(2.28\) should be compared with the optimality condi-  
tion for independent-demand model; namely, it is optimal to open class  
if and only if  
\(Indeed, note that \(2.28\) reduces to the above expression for the  
independent-demand model since for this model for all  
Note that the right-hand side above is zero while the right-hand  
side of \(2.28\) is nonzero \(typically positive\). This happens because in the  
independent-demand model, if we close class we lose all demand  
for that class. Therefore, it is optimal to accept class whenever  
exceeds the opportunity cost However, in the choice-  
based model, if we close class customers choose from among the  
other classes that are offered \(e.g., from Hence, the threshold on  
the right-hand side of \(2.28\) is nonzero. This difference reflects the fact 74  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
that customers may buy up to a higher class, so there is some nonzero  
benefit to rejecting a request for  
**2.6.2.8 A Numerical Comparison to EMSR-b with Buy-Up**  
We next look at the results of a small simulation study comparing  
choice-based methods to a traditional EMSR-b method with buy-up  
as described in Section 2.6.1. While the EMSR-b model is developed  
under the static-model assumptions, it is frequently used as a heuristic  
in the dynamic case by simply aggregating the total demand to come for  
each class. Also, it is one of the few models available that incorporates  
some type of choice behavior. For these reasons, it serves as a useful  
benchmark for comparison.  
This simulations are based on our running three-class example, Ex-  
ample 2.5. We compare the optimal control given by the choice dynamic  
program with the traditional EMSR-b \(buy-up\) recommendations. \(Re-  
call that for Example 2.5 the optimal dynamic programming policy uses  
the fare classes in the order *Y, K, M,* whereas the EMSR-b uses them in  
the fare order *Y, M, K.*\)  
The capacity *C =* 20, and there are three population sizes\: 15,20,  
and 25. The fares, restrictions, and customer segments are as given in  
Table 2.8. For a population size of 20 this results in an unconstrained  
mean and variance as shown in Table 2.11. These statistics are used to  
create inputs for EMSR-b. The buy-up factors are computed as shown  
in Table 2.12, which lists the unconstrained choices and demands when  
all classes are open. \(N.E. signifies that the segment is not eligible.\)  
This estimate roughly mimics the traditional practice of unconstraining  
and forecasting demand in each class. Table 2.12 then sums the uncon-  
strained demands for each fare class. The buy-up factors are estimated  
as follows. The buy-up factor for *K* is given by the percentage *K* cus-  
tomers who would buy up to *M* if we go from offering \{*Y, M, K*\} to  
\{*Y*, *M*\}*.* Similarly the buy-up factor for *M* is the fraction who buy up *Single-Resource Capacity Control*  
75  
to *Y* when going from offering \{*Y, M*\} to *Y.* Table 2.12 shows these  
demands and buy-up factors for a population size of 20, and Table 2.13  
shows the computed EMSR-b protection levels for this population size.  
The results for the three load factors are summarized in Table 2.14.  
Note that the choice dynamic program shows significant improvements  
on this example, achieving an 11.5% improvement in revenue in the high-  
demand case. Again, part of this improvement can be attributed to the  
fact that the choice dynamic program uses a different sequence of classes  
\(only the efficient sets \{*Y*\}*,* \{*Y, K*\}*,* \{*Y, M*, *K*\}\)*.*  
**2.7 Notes and Sources**  
The notion of theft versus standard nesting is not well documented  
and is part of the folklore of RM practice. Our understanding, however,  
greatly benefited from discussions with our colleagues Peter Belobaba,  
Sanne de Boer, and Craig Hopperstad.  
The earliest paper on the static models of Section 2.2 is Little-  
wood \[347\]. Another early applied paper is Bhatia and Parekh \[64\].  
But there are close connections to earlier work on the stock-rationing  
problem in the inventory literature by Kaplan \[288\] and Topkis \[515\]; 76  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
see also Gerchak \[209, 210\] and Ha \[246\]. Indeed, Topkis’s \[515\] results  
can be used to show the optimality of nested-allocation policies.  
Optimal policies for the case were obtained in close succession  
\(using slightly different methods and assumptions\) in papers by Brumelle  
and McGill \[91\], Curry \[139\], Robinson \[445\], and Wollmer \[576\]. See  
also McGill’s thesis \[375\]. Robinson \[445\] also analyzed the case where  
the order of arrival is not the same as the revenue order. Brumelle et al.  
\[90\] analyzed a two-class static model with dependent demand.  
The Monte Carlo method for computing optimal overbooking limits  
presented in Section 2.2.3.2 is due to Robinson \[445\].  
The dynamic model of Section 2.5 was first analyzed by Lee and  
Hersh \[336\]. However, the proofs of Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 in Ap-  
pendix 2.A are due to Lautenbacher and Stidham \[330\], who provided a  
unified analysis of both the static and dynamic single-resource models.  
Walczak and Brumelle \[543\] relate this problem to a dynamic pricing  
problem using a Markov model of demand that allows for partial infor-  
mation on the revenue values or customer types. See Liang \[342\] for an  
analysis of a continuous-time version of the dynamic model.  
The EMSR-a and EMSR-b heuristics are both due to Belobaba. The  
most detailed coverage of EMSR-a is contained in Belobaba’s 1987 the-  
sis \[39\], but see also the published articles from it \[38\] and \[40\]. EMSR-b  
was introduced in \[41\]; see also Belobaba and Weatherford \[37\].  
The problem of group or batch request in Section 2.4 was addressed  
by Lee and Hersh \[336\] for the partially accepted case. For the more  
complex case where groups must be completely accepted, see Walczak  
and Brumelle \[544\], Kleywegt and Papastavrou \[307\], and Van Slyke and  
Young \[530\].  
The adaptive algorithm in Section 2 3 is due to van Ryzin and  
McGill \[526\]. The buy-up heuristics in Section 2.6.1 are due to Be-  
lobaba \[39, 38, 40\]. See also Belobaba and Weatherford \[37\], Weather-  
ford \[555\], and the simulation study of Bohutinsky \[81\]. See Titze \[514\]  
for a discussion of passenger behavior in the simple two-class model.  
The material in Section 2.6.2 on choice-based models is from Talluri  
and van Ryzin \[500\]; see also Algers and Besser \[7\] and Andersson \[18\]  
for an application of discrete-choice models at SAS. For a good refer-  
ence on discrete-choice modeling, see Ben-Akiva and Lerman \[48\]. De  
Boer \[155\] is another recent work that addresses customer choice in a  
single-resource problem.  
# APPENDIX 2.A\: Monotonicity Proofs  
The proofs of monotonicity are based on a lemma of Stidham \[487\] originally  
developed to analyze queueing-control problems. The lemma was adapted to provide *APPENDIX 2.A\: Monotonicity Proofs* 77  
a convexity proof for a general single-resource problem, which includes both the static  
and dynamic models, in work by Lautenbacher and Stidham \[330\]. The proof here  
follows theirs.  
We begin with a definition\:

in this range.

# Proof of Proposition 2.1  
We first prove part \(i\) of Proposition 2.1—namely, that the marginal value  
is nonincreasing in \(that is concave in The proof is by induction on the  
stages. Note that in the terminal stage \(stage 0\), for all which is 78

weights\) of concave functions, and hence it follows that is concave as well.  
Part \(ii\) of the Proposition 2.1 says that the marginal value at a given capacity  
at stage is less than at stage This is shown as follows\:  
where the first inequality follows because is the optimal protection level at stage

# Proof of Monotonicity of Marginal Values from the Choice-Based Model

Therefore,  
To show the marginal values are monotone increasing in the remaining time, note  
that

# NETWORK CAPACITY CONTROL  
**3.1 Introduction**  
In this chapter, we examine quantity-based revenue management of  
multiple resources—commonly referred to as *network* RM. This class of  
problems arises in airline, railway, cruise-line, and hotel RM—and in  
general, whenever customers buy bundles of resources in combination  
under various terms and conditions. In the airline case, the problem is  
managing the capacities of a set of connecting flights across a network,  
where flights can have a mix of connecting and local traffic A product  
in this case is an *origin-destination itinerary fare class* combination—or  
ODIF as it is called in airline terminology. In the hotel RM case, the  
problem is managing room capacity on consecutive days when customers  
stay multiple nights, where a mix of customers with different lengths of  
stay share the capacity on any given day. \(See Figure 3.1.\)  
When products are sold as bundles, the lack of availability of any  
one resource in the bundle limits sales. This creates interdependence  
among the resources, and hence, to maximize total revenues, it be-  
comes necessary to jointly manage \(coordinate\) the capacity controls  
on all resources.1 In the airline industry, this problem is also called *the*  
*passenger-mix problem* or *O&D \(origin-destination\) control,* and in the  
hotel industry, *length-of-stay control.* We use the now-standard term  
*network RM*—though the term is something of a misnomer because the  
theory and methodology do not require an explicit network structure as  
such.  
1As in all quantity-based RM, we assume here that prices are fixed for all the products and  
that we manage only the *allocation* of the resources to the different products. 82 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**3.1.1 The Promise and Challenge of Network**  
# Control  
There can be significant revenue benefits in taking a network approach  
to RM. Indeed, simulation studies of airline hub-and-spoke networks by  
various researchers have demonstrated notable revenue benefits from us-  
ing network methods over single-resource methods \[36, 43, 565, 566\].  
2  
While precise improvement numbers are dependent on the type of net-  
work, the mix and variance of demand, the load factor, etc., improve-  
ments on the order of 1.5% are not uncommon at moderate load factors,  
and gains can be as high as 3% or more at higher load factors.2  
In terms  
of practice, the potential improvements have been sufficient to justify  
2Such gains have been observed in simulations on airline data, for networks with up to 100  
flights, and under an independent-class assumption similar to that of Section 2.2.2. *Network Capacity Control* 83  
significant investments in network RM systems within the airline and  
hotel industries and elsewhere.  
While the potential benefit may be high, network RM poses significant  
implementation and methodological challenges. On the implementation  
side, network RM vastly increases the complexity and volume of data  
that one must collect, store, and manage. The resulting data and infor-  
mation systems requirements make the transition from single-resource  
to network RM often a difficult and expensive one.  
Network RM also creates organizational challenges. Since revenue de-  
cisions and their effects now span an entire network, it is no longer easy  
to assign revenue responsibility for a resource to a single analyst; rev-  
enue losses at one point in the network may be offset by gains elsewhere  
in the network. As a result, creating organizations and incentive struc-  
tures that support the objectives of network RM is a challenging task.  
Moreover, the transition to a network-oriented RM organization can be  
difficult for employees who are used to a simpler view of the world.  
Network RM creates methodological and operational challenges as  
well. On the forecasting side, it requires a massive increase in the scale  
of the forecasting system, which now must forecast demand for each  
individual network product at each point in the booking process. In  
addition, the sparsity of the data at this finer level of detail creates  
numerical and estimation problems, and one has to wrestle with the  
problem of combining forecasts at various levels of aggregation.  
Optimization is more complex as well. In the case of a single-resource  
problem, there are many exact optimization methods. However, in the  
network case, exact optimization is for all practical purposes impossible.  
Therefore, optimization methods use approximations of various types.  
Achieving a good balance between the quality of the approximation and  
the efficiency of the resulting algorithms becomes the primary challenge.  
**3.1.2 Types of Controls**  
As with single-resource problems, in network allocation problems there  
are a variety of ways one can control the availability of capacity. The  
objective is to find an effective and easy-to-implement mechanism to al-  
locate capacity to requests for products that require a combination of  
resources. The technological constraints imposed by the distribution sys-  
tems, the revenue performance achievable by the method, and the overall  
robustness of the control scheme are important criteria for choosing the  
control mechanism.  
We next look at the major categories of network controls. Most  
are network versions of the controls used in single-resource RM \(Sec- 84 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
tion 2.1.1\). But others—virtual nesting, in particular–are specific to  
network RM.  
**3.1.2.1 Partitioned Booking Limits**  
Partitioned booking-limit control for network RM is an extension of  
the partitioned control for single-resource RM \(Section 2.1.1.1\). In the  
network case, partitioned booking limits allocate a fixed amount of ca-  
pacity on each resource for every product that is offered. These allocated  
amounts of capacity are non-overlapping—or partitioned; demand for a  
product has exclusive access to its allocated capacity, and no other prod-  
uct may use this capacity.  
Partitioned booking limits for the network case have all the defects  
mentioned in Section 2.1.1.1 and then some. Allocating fixed amounts  
of capacity to each product results in dividing the capacity of each re-  
source into a very large number of small allocations. This fragmenting  
of capacity can result in tremendous inefficiencies when demand is sto-  
chastic, and for this reasons partitioned booking limits are seldom used  
in practice.3  
Partitioned booking limits do have an important role to play both  
theoretically and computationally, however. Theoretically, they are used  
to provide bounds on the optimal network revenue. Computationally,  
they are used in many approximate models \(such as the deterministic  
linear programming method discussed below\).  
**3.1.2.2 Virtual Nesting Controls**  
Nested booking limits, of the type we saw in Section 2.1.1 for the  
single-resource case, are difficult to translate directly into a network set-  
ting. One difficulty is that the ordering of classes is no longer straight-  
forward.4 A second difficulty is that the different capacities of the re-  
sources involved makes it difficult to specify protection levels or booking  
limits for products that are consistent across the resources in the net-  
work. However, the ability of nested controls to dynamically share the  
capacity of a resource—and thereby recover the pooling economies lost  
in partitioned controls—is an attractive feature.  
3  
Though Ciancimino et al. \[118\] report study a RM model for the Italian railroad in which  
partitioned allocations worked well \(at least relative to first come, first serve\), though in their  
railroad problem the number of products using each resource was small \(3 to 6\).  
4Of course, we’ve seen in Chapter 2 that for even the single-resource case, the ordering is not  
always simply the order of the prices. For example, when refunds are class dependent or one  
models consumer choice behavior, nesting may not be optimal and the ordering of classes  
may be different from the simple fare order. *Network Capacity Control* 85  
Virtual nesting control—a hybrid of network and single-resource  
controls—provides one solution. American Airlines is credited with de-  
veloping this control scheme \(circa 1983\) as a way of incorporating some  
degree of network control within the single-resource nested-allocation  
structure of American’s single-resource-based \(at that time\) reservation  
system.  
Virtual nesting uses single-resource nested-allocation controls for each  
resource in the network. However, the classes used in these nested al-  
locations are *virtual classes,* which group together sets of products that  
use a given resource. Products are assigned to a virtual class through a  
process known as *indexing,* which essentially provides a table that maps  
every product to a virtual class on each resource. This indexing, which  
attempts to cluster products based on their “network value,” may be  
updated periodically as network demand patterns change.  
Nested booking limits \(or protection levels\) for each resource are then  
computed using these virtual classes. To decide on a request for a net-  
work product, the system checks for availability of its corresponding  
virtual classes on each resource. If *all* the virtual classes are available,  
the request is accepted; if *any one* of the virtual classes is closed, the  
request is rejected.  
Virtual nesting has a few notable disadvantages. For one, the indexing  
process can create potential difficulties in data collection and forecasting.  
Specifically, if data is collected at the virtual class level, then reindexing  
can alter the parameters of demand in a virtual class by changing which  
products are mapped into each virtual class. As a result, the virtual  
class demand statistics may shift dramatically even when the underlying  
product-level demand is unchanged. In this way, indexing can introduce  
its own “noise” into the data and forecasts. Virtual classes can also  
cause confusion for analysts, who may not be able to easily interpret  
virtual class demand. Finally, both the indexing process and the control  
logic of mapping products to virtual classes create complexity.  
At the same time, virtual nesting has several advantages. It preserves  
the booking-class control logic of most existing GDSs, so no major in-  
frastructure changes are required, yet it allows a RM system to incor-  
porate some network information. It therefore provides an acceptable  
compromise between single-resource and full network control and has  
proven to be quite effective and popular in practice, especially in the  
airline industry.  
Virtual nesting was a genuine breakthrough in RM when it was in-  
troduced by American Airlines and still has a strong contingency of in-  
dustry and academic supporters. However, its main benefit—its ability  
to preserve the single-resource, nested-allocation structure of control—is 86 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
somewhat particular to the travel and hospitality industry, where such  
controls are part of the industry’s legacy distribution systems. For in-  
dustries without this legacy infrastructure, bid-price controls provide  
simpler, more intuitive, and powerful means of network control. Even  
within the airline industry, bid-price control is gaining popularity as  
CDS and RM system vendors upgrade their technologies.  
**3.1.2.3 Bid-Price Controls**  
While nested allocations are difficult to extend directly to network  
RM control, network bid-price control is a simple extension of the single-  
resource version described in Chapter 2. In a network setting, a bid-price  
control sets a threshold price—or *bid price*—for each resource in the  
network. This bid price is normally interpreted as an estimate of the  
marginal cost to the network of consuming the next incremental unit  
of the resource’s capacity. When a request for a product comes in, the  
revenue of the request is compared with the *sum* of the bid prices of the  
resources required by the product. If the revenue exceeds the sum of the  
bid prices, the request is accepted; if not, it is rejected.  
Bid-price controls have many advantages. First, even in a network  
setting the structure of the control remains simple\: we have to specify  
only a single value for each resource \(not each product\), so the number  
of parameters involved is minimal.5 Second, evaluating a request for a  
product requires only a simple comparison of revenue to the sum of bid  
prices for the requested resources, so the transaction-processing task is  
quick. Third, bid prices are intuitive and have a natural economic inter-  
pretation as the marginal cost to the network of each resource. Finally,  
if implemented correctly, bid prices have very good revenue performance  
and can even be shown to be theoretically near-optimal under certain  
conditions.  
Despite these advantages, bid-price controls have generated consider-  
able controversy among both RM practitioners and academics alike. The  
debate about bid prices being “unsafe” was discussed in Section 2.1.1.4  
in the single-resource context. The issues are essentially the same in  
the network case. Also, in the airline industry, as simple as the bid-  
price control logic may be, it is a vast departure from the control logic  
used in existing GDSs, and their acceptance has not been immediate.  
Bid-price control requires the GDS to support seamless availability \(Sec-  
5Though to work properly, bid prices must be updated with changes in capacity and time.  
This often necessitates storing a table of bid price values and the values are retrieved based  
on the current remaining capacity and the current remaining time. \(See Table 3.1.\) Still,  
only one such table is required for each resource, and the look-up is quick. *Network Capacity Control* 87  
tion 11.2.3.2\) and other real-time capabilities to connect to the host CRS  
and instantly respond to requests—technologies that have only recently  
become widespread. Hotel RM systems, of more recent vintage and  
without the legacy-system burdens of airlines, have been in a better po-  
sition to adapt bid-price control, and it has become the dominant form  
of control for network RM in the hotel industry.  
We next look at the theory behind network controls. Network RM  
is complex and difficult to analyze, and few exact theoretical results  
are available. However, asymptotic analysis giving some insight into  
the optimal form of control is sometimes possible, and we review it in  
Section 3.6.  
**3.2 The Theory of Optimal Network Controls**  
We begin with a basic model of the problem. The network has  
resources, and the firm sells products. \(Each network product is a  
combination of a bundle of the resources sold with certain purchase  
terms and restrictions at a given price.\) Let if resource is  
used by product and otherwise. Define the *incidence matrix*  
Thus, the column of **A**, denoted is the *incidence*  
*vector* for product the row, denoted has an entry of one in  
6  
column corresponding to a product that uses resource We let  
denote the set of legs used by product and to denote the set of  
products that use resource so that the notation indicates that  
resource is used by product and indicates that product uses  
resource  
The state of the network is described by a vector  
of resource capacities. If product is sold, the state of the network  
changes to To simplify our analysis at this stage, we will ignore  
cancellations and no-shows. We will also omit the possibility of booking  
requests for multiple units of capacity \(say, corresponding to a group or  
batch request\) to simplify the presentation.  
Time is discrete, there are periods, and the index represents the  
current time \(with the time indices running forward, so is the  
time of service\). Within each time-period as we did for the dynamic  
single-resource case, we assume that at most one request for a product  
can arrive; that is, the discretization of time is sufficiently fine so that  
the probability of more than one request is negligible.  
6  
Note that there will be multiple identical columns if there are multiple ways of selling a  
given bundle of resources. For example, in the airline case there may be many fare classes  
for the same itinerary. Each would have an identical column in the matrix **A**, but they could  
have different revenue values and different demand patterns. 88 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Demand in period is modeled as the realization of a *single* random  
vector If this indicates a  
request for product occurred and that its associated price is if  
this indicates there is no request for product A realization  
\(all components equal to zero\) indicates that no request from  
*any* product occurred at time  
For example, if we have products, then a value  
indicates no requests arrived, a value indicates a re-  
quest for product 1 with a price of \$120, a value of  
indicates a request for product 1 with a price of \$140, and a value  
indicates a request for product 2 with a price of \$70,  
and so on.  
The sequence is assumed to be independent across time  
with known joint distribution in each period Let the prices associated  
with the products be This is the network version of the  
independence by class assumption that we make in Chapter 2. \(See also  
Section 7.1.\) We make this assumption for all models in this chapter.  
Given the current time the current remaining capacity **x**, and the  
current request the quantity-based RM decision is as follows\: Do  
we or do we not accept the current request?  
Let the denote this decision, where if we  
accept a request for product in period and otherwise. The  
decision to accept, is a function of the remaining capacity vector  
**x** and the price of product —that is, —and hence  
Since we can accept at most one request in any period  
and resources cannot be oversold, if the current seat inventory is **x**, then  
is restricted to the set  
**3.2.1 The Structure of Optimal Controls**  
To formulate a dynamic program to determine optimal decisions  
let denote the maximum expected revenue to go, given  
remaining capacity **x** in period Then must satisfy the Bellman  
equation  
with the boundary condition *Network Capacity Control* 89  
It is easy to show that optimal control satisfies  
is finite for all finite **x**. Moreover, an  
The control \(3.3\) says that an optimal policy for accepting requests is of  
the form\: accept a request for product \(at price \) if and only if we  
have sufficient remaining capacity and  
where is the price of product This reflects the rather  
intuitive notion that we accept a booking request for a product only  
if its price exceeds the *opportunity cost* of the reduction in resource  
capacities required to satisfy the request.  
**3.2.2 Bid Price Controls**  
The displacement cost intuition of \(3.3\) leads naturally to bid-price  
controls for network RM, and indeed the analogy to the role of dual  
prices in deterministic optimization motivated the early development of  
bid-price control schemes by Simpson \[476\] and Williamson \[565, 566\].  
If we suppose, in a heuristic sense, that the value function has  
a gradient then the condition for accepting product can be  
approximated by  
where ing definition\:  
DEFINITION 3.1 *A control ist real-valued functions*  
*\(called **bid prices**\) such that*  
This line of reasoning motivates the follow-  
*is a **bid-price control** if there ex-*  
In other words, a bid-price control specifies a set of bid prices for each  
resource, at each point in time, and for each capacity level, such that we 90 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
accept a request for a particular product if and only if there is available  
capacity and the price exceeds the sum of the bid prices for all the  
resources used by the product. Bid-price control can be implemented by  
specifying a bid price table for each resource. Table 3.1 gives an example  
of such a table.  
**3.2.3 Nonoptimality of Bid-Price Controls**  
Despite the generality of Definition 3.1, bid prices are not always an  
optimal form of control. The following example shows that there are  
cases where no set of bid prices is able to achieve the optimal control  
decision \(3.3\)\:  
**Example 3.1** Consider a network with two resources. There is one unit of capacity  
on each resource and two time-periods. The product data are shown in Table 3.2. In  
period 1, demands for all three products can arrive\: products 1 and 2 require resources  
1 and 2, respectively, and each has a price of \$250 and a probability of arrival 0.3.  
Product 3 requires both resources and has a price of \$500 and probability of arrival  
0.4.  
In the last period \(period 2\), there is demand only for product 3 with the same  
\$500 price and a probability of arrival of 0.8. Arrivals in each period are mutually  
exclusive \(only one product per period arrives\).  
It is not hard to see by inspection that an optimal policy is to reject product 1 and  
2 in period 1 and accept product 3 in both periods. This is true because accepting  
products 1 or 2 in period 1 yields \$250 in revenue but prevents us from accepting  
product 3 in period 2, which results in an opportunity cost of \$400 \(0.8 × \$500\). So *Network Capacity Control* 91  
it is optimal to *reject* both products 1 and 2 in period 1. However, we clearly want  
to accept product 3 in period 1, since we cannot gain more than \$500 in period 2.  
This implies that the bid prices, and in period 1 must satisfy  
and which is, of course, impossible. Therefore, no bid price  
policy can produce an optimal decision in period 1.  
Indeed, it is not hard to show that the best a bid price policy can do in this example  
is to reject *all* demand in period 1 and accept only product 3 \(if it arrives\) in period  
2, yielding a \$400 expected revenue. The optimal policy, in contrast, generates an  
expected revenue of \$440—fully 10% more expected revenue than by the best possible  
bid price policy.7  
This counterexample illustrates the two main reasons that bid-price  
controls may not be optimal. One reason that bid prices in this example  
fail is that selling a seat is a “large” change in the capacity of a resource.  
Large relative changes in capacity on several resources simultaneously  
cannot, in general, be expected to produce the same revenue effect as the  
sum of the individual changes. So gradient-based reasoning falls short  
in explaining bid price optimality.  
The second reason that bid prices may fail to capture the opportunity  
cost is that future revenues may depend in a highly nonlinear way on the  
displaced capacity. In the counterexample, note that the *minimum* ca-  
pacity on the two resources determines future expected revenues. Hence,  
the opportunity cost of using a single resource exactly equals the oppor-  
tunity cost of using both resources simultaneously. This phenomenon  
is analogous to degeneracy in mathematical programming, and it can  
occur in the optimal value function or in various approximations to the  
optimal value function, as shown below in Section 3.3.  
**3.2.4 Evidence in Support of Bid Prices**  
While most of these results on bid price optimality are negative, Sec-  
tion 3.6 provides some theoretical results showing that bid-price controls  
are asymptotically optimal under certain “large-number” scalings of the  
network RM problem. Thus, there are conditions under which bid prices  
are provably good. In addition, numerical simulation studies have largely  
confirmed that bid prices \(properly implemented\) are an effective control  
mechanism for network RM.  
**3.2.5 Bid Prices and Opportunity Cost**  
One interesting observation about bid prices is that there need not be  
a one-to-one correspondence between optimal bid prices and the oppor-  
7The \$440 optimal revenue is obtained by accepting product 3 only in both periods 1 and 2,  
in which case the expected revenue is 0.4 × \$500 + \(1 – 0.4\) × 0.8 × \$500 = \$440. 92 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
tunity cost of capacity. That is, one can generate examples of bid prices  
that give optimal accept or deny decisions but that at the same time are  
very poor approximations to the marginal value of resource capacity.  
Consider, for example, a single-resource problem in which high-  
revenue products arrive strictly *before* low-revenue products. In this case,  
it is clear that it is optimal to accept arrivals in a first-come, first-serve  
\(FCFS\) order. Therefore, a constant bid price of zero is one optimal solu-  
tion. On the other hand, the opportunity cost  
at each point in time will in general not be zero.  
In other words, while it is *sufficient* to compare the revenue with the  
opportunity cost at each time to make optimal accept or deny decisions,  
it is not *necessary* to do so; other threshold values may produce the  
same accept or deny decision and the same optimal revenues, as in our  
example. One might argue that this difference is not worth worrying  
about as long as we can identify one bid-price value that is optimal.  
However, in practice a good estimate of opportunity cost is desirable,  
since opportunity-cost numbers from a RM system often support other  
decision making, such as capacity planning or pricing. Thus, bid prices  
that accurately approximate the opportunity cost of capacity are more  
valuable than ones that do not, even if both perform equally well in a  
RM system.  
**3.3 Approximations Based on Network Models**  
For any network of realistic size, computing the value function  
in \(3.1\) exactly is essentially hopeless because of the large dimensionality  
of the state space \(e.g., a network with resources and capaci-  
ties of *C =* 100 on each resource has states\). Instead, one must  
rely on approximations of various types. Most approximation methods  
proposed to date follow one of two basic \(not necessarily mutually ex-  
clusive\) strategies. The first, which we look at in this section, is to use  
a simplified network model—for example, posing the problem as a sta-  
tic mathematical programming problem. The second strategy, which we  
look at in the next section, is to decompose the network problem into a  
collection of single-resource problems. Whichever method is used, it is  
useful to view all such methods as producing different approximations  
of the optimal value function.  
The most useful output of an approximation method are estimates of  
displacement costs—or bid prices. These are used either directly in bid-  
price control mechanisms or indirectly in other mechanisms like virtual  
nesting. Given an approximation method *M* that yields an estimate of  
the value function we can approximate the displacement cost of *Network Capacity Control* 93  
accepting product by  
where by  
is the gradient of the value function approximation  
assuming the gradient exists. The bid prices are then defined  
If the gradient does not exist, then is typically replaced \(at  
least implicitly\) by a subgradient of If the approximation is  
discrete, then first differences are used in place of partial derivatives.  
Using a sum of bid prices to approximate displacement cost, rather  
than the difference directly, is done mainly to  
simplify the control. As mentioned above, one of the appeals of bid-  
price control is that it requires only resource-level bid prices \(one  
for each resource\) rather than product-level controls—and in large  
networks, can be several orders of magnitude smaller than This  
makes additive bid prices appealing on a practical level. Still, as shown  
by Example 3.1, such additive approximations can be inaccurate in some  
cases, and non-additive bid prices may be needed. \(Berstsimas and  
Popescu \[61\] examine this issue of additive versus non-additive bid-price  
controls.\)  
Clearly, one objective for an approximation method is to produce a  
good estimate of the value function—and more important, a good esti-  
mate of the displacement costs or bid prices. On the other hand, speed  
of computation matters as well. The approximation may be a  
static approximation that must be re-solved quite frequently in prac-  
tice to account for changes in remaining capacity **x** and remaining time  
A static method that is accurate but computationally complex will  
therefore be of little use in practice. An approximation that produces  
dynamic estimates of displacement cost—for example, bid prices that  
vary with capacity and time—can be solved less frequently, but still  
changes in forecasts and fare input data inevitably occur and necessi-  
tate recomputing the model. Thus, one should always keep these two  
criteria—accuracy and speed—in mind when judging network approxi-  
mation methods.  
**3.3.1 The Deterministic Linear Programming**  
# Model  
Let the aggregate demand to come at time for each product be  
denoted \(demand over the periods \) with mean  
Let and denote the vector of demands 94 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and mean demands, respectively. The *deterministic linear programming*  
\(DLP\) method uses the approximation  
The decision variables represent the partitioned alloca-  
tion of capacity for each of the products. The approximation effectively  
treats demand as if it were deterministic and equal to its mean and  
makes an optimal partitioned allocation accordingly. Using Jensen’s in-  
equality, one can show that is in fact an upper bound on the  
optimal value function \[111, 112, 131\].  
Occasionally, the optimal primal solution to \(3.6\) is used to construct  
a partitioned control directly. More often, the primal allocations are  
discarded, and one uses only the optimal dual variables, denoted  
associated with the constraints as bid prices. If the optimal  
solution is not degenerate, that is, if the active constraints are linearly  
independent at the optimal solution, then exists and is given  
by the unique vector of optimal dual prices, if the optimal solution  
is degenerate, then there are multiple optimal dual price vectors, each  
of which is only a subgradient of the function  
The main advantage of the DLP model is that it is computationally  
very efficient to solve. Due to its simplicity and speed, it is popular in  
practice. The weakness of the DLP approximation is that it considers  
only the mean demand, ignoring all uncertainty in the forecasts, and  
models only a partitioned control mechanism. One consequence of this is  
that the dual values will be zero on any resource that has a mean demand  
less than capacity, a behavior that can cause problems in practice.  
Despite this deficiency, simulation studies \(with the independent-class  
assumption\) by several researchers have shown that with frequent re-  
optimization, the performance of DLP bid prices is rather respectable,  
producing higher revenue than both the probabilistic nonlinear program-  
ming model of Section 3.3.2 and a variety of leg-based EMSR heuristics  
\[36, 43, 565, 566\], though other studies have reported more mixed re-  
sults \[42\]. In general, the performance of the DLP method, like many  
network methods, depends heavily on the type of network, the variance  
in the demand forecasts, the order in which fare products arrive, and  
the frequency of reoptimization.8  
8  
Cooper \[131\] provides a counterexample in which more frequent reoptimization of a DLP  
model \(using bid-price controls\) results in worse revenue performance, though the prepon-  
derance of numerical evidence suggests that frequent reoptimization is beneficial. *Network Capacity Control* 95  
One variation in the use of DLP proposed by Bertsimas and  
Popescu \[61\] is not to use the dual prices produced by the model but to  
use discrete differences as an estimate of the marginal value of capacity.  
Specifically, for each product we compute the difference in the value  
functions  
and then use this value as a bid price for product The motivation  
here is both to eliminate the potential problem of degeneracy and also to  
better reflect the discrete change in capacity that occurs when accepting  
a request. In numerical experiments, this modification appears to offer  
a modest improvement over using additive bid prices based on the dual  
variables A disadvantage of this approach, however, is that to  
determine controls for all products, one must solve a separate linear  
program for each product which increases the computational effort  
substantially relative to DLP-based bid price controls.9  
**3.3.2 The Probabilistic Nonlinear Programming**  
# Model  
The *probabilistic nonlinear programming* \(PNLP\) method uses the  
approximation  
where and are defined as in the DLP case. As in the DLP, the  
decision variable represents a partitioned allocation of capacity to  
product and the term is the expected sales of product  
under this partitioned allocation. Since partitioned allocations are  
certainly a feasible policy for the network problem, is in fact  
a lower bound on the optimal value function \[111\].  
While this model results in a nonlinear program, it is a relatively easy  
one; the objective function is concave and separable in the variables  
and the constraints are linear. A variety of specialized algorithms  
for separable concave problems make the PNLP model feasible for large  
networks.  
If demand is discrete, one can also convert the model to a linear pro-  
gram, albeit one with many more variables. This is achieved by assigning  
9  
Though “warm starting” the LP solver using the current solution for **x** reduces the compu-  
tation time significantly. 96 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
a variable to each product *and* to each unit of capacity. Specifically, de-  
unit of capacity allocated to product  
fine variable to be the Then the PNLP model can be written  
where is an upper bound on the capacity allocated to product \(for  
example, the minimum capacity remaining among the resources used  
by product \). The equivalence of the formulations \(3.7\) and \(3.8\) fol-  
lows from the fact that \(for discrete distributions\)  
and that is decreasing in  
Formulation \(3.8\) is sometimes referred to as the *probabilistic lin-*  
*ear programming model,* but it is in fact equivalent to the PNLP for  
discrete demand and is a close approximation to the PNLP for contin-  
uous demand distributions. Because of the large number of variables  
introduced in converting the PNLP model to a linear program—and the  
simple structure of the nonlinear version of the PNLP model—it is often  
more efficient to solve the PNLP model directly as a nonlinear program.  
Another alternative is to attempt to reduce the size of the PNLP by ap-  
proximating demand distributions with a coarser discretization, which  
de Boer et al. \[154\] show does not affect the performance significantly.  
Whichever approach is used to solve the PNLP, one can obtain bid  
price values from the resulting dual variables. If the active constraints  
are linearly independent at the optimal solution, then ex-  
ists and is given by the unique vector of optimal dual prices associated  
with these constraints; if the active constraints are dependent, then mul-  
tiple optimal dual vectors are subgradients of the function  
**3.3.2.1 Qualitative Behavior of PNLP**  
On the surface, the PNLP approximation appears somewhat better  
than the DLP approximation, in that the term in the  
objective function captures the randomness in demand. For example,  
unlike in the DLP approximation, the PNLP dual price of a resource  
can be positive even when mean demand for the resource is strictly less  
than capacity, reflecting the fact that there is some probability that  
demand will exceed capacity. However, the assumption of partitioned *Network Capacity Control* 97  
allocations of capacity to each product can lead to poor behavior, and  
simulation studies have generally confirmed that PNLP bid prices result  
in lower revenues than DLP bid prices \[154, 565, 566\].  
To understand the weakness of the PNLP approximation, consider  
the following example\:  
**Example 3.2** A network has leg and products on the leg, each of which is  
identical. That is, each product has demand and each product has  
the same revenue The PNLP formulation is then  
Now, by symmetry the optimal solution is Kuhn-Tucker conditions imply the optimal dual price and hence the  
satisfies  
where is the c.d.f. of the standard normal distribution, then forms an estimate  
of the marginal value of the seat.  
However, since all products are identical, the marginal value in this problem should  
be unchanged if we aggregate all products into one product with mean and vari-  
ance Aggregating and applying the PNLP, we find the optimal dual multiplier  
in this case satisfies  
If and is large, \(3.9\) and \(3.10\) give very different estimates of the marginal  
revenue. Of course, from first principles, the opportunity cost should be independent  
of how we aggregate \(or disaggregate\) the identical products.  
Example 3.2 shows how the partitioned allocation assumption of the  
PNLP model can potentially lead to poor estimates of opportunity cost.  
While on the surface this example seems contrived, it is not uncommon to  
observe similar behavior in large airline networks. For example, in hub-  
and-spoke networks if many uncongested in-bound legs have connecting  
passengers traveling on a single congested out-bound leg and passengers  
pay comparable revenues, then the situation is similar to the example  
above; one would like to treat all passengers as a single class \(“pool” the  
products\), but the PNLP allocates space to each one separately, resulting  
in a distorted estimate of the marginal value. The DLP method does  
not suffer this lack-of-pooling defect as shown below\: 98 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**Example 3.3** Consider the deterministic linear programming version of Exam-  
ple 3.2. If we define the problem for the original products, we get the linear  
program  
If we aggregate all the demand in to one product, we get the linear program  
It is not hard to see that these both have the same optimal dual solution and hence  
produce the same estimate of the marginal revenue.  
Essentially, the DLP makes one particularly bad assumption\: demand  
is deterministic. But once this assumption is made, there is no further  
loss in optimality by formulating the model using partitioned allocations.  
In the PNLP case, the demand assumption is more realistic, but under  
this demand assumption, using partitioned allocations becomes highly  
suboptimal.  
**3.3.3 The Randomized Linear Programming**  
# Model  
*Randomized linear programming* \(RLP\) is another approach for incor-  
porating stochastic information into the DLP method based on replacing  
the expected value of **D** in the constraint \(3.6\) by the random vector **D**  
itself. The expected value of the resulting optimal solution then forms  
an approximation to the value function. That is, define  
The optimal value is a random variable. Let denote  
an optimal vector of dual prices for the set of constraints and  
note that is a random vector.  
Next, consider approximating the value function by the expected value  
of  
Note the right-hand side corresponds to a “perfect-information” approx-  
imation because it reflects a case in which *future* allocations \(and rev-  
enues\) are based on perfect knowledge of the realized demand **D**; how-  
ever, at time **D** is not yet realized so the right-hand side is the expected  
value of this perfect-information solution. Assuming that the gradient  
exists, we then use as a vector of bid prices. *Network Capacity Control* 99  
**3.3.3.1 Estimating the Gradient via Simulation**  
The RLP approximation \(3.12\) requires a method to efficiently com-  
pute One simple approach is to consider interchanging  
differentiation and expectation. There are formal conditions under which  
such an interchange is justified,10 but assuming it is, we have  
This interchange, in turn, suggests a procedure for estimating  
Simply simulate independent samples of the demand  
and solve \(3.11\) for each sample. Then estimate  
vector, the gradient using  
In other words, simply *average* the dual prices from perfect-information  
allocation solutions on randomly generated demands. This idea is called  
the *randomized linear programming* \(RLP\) method.  
The RLP method has several appealing features. First, it is a simple  
modification to the DLP method, so it can be easily incorporated into  
RM systems based on DLP. Second, it has the flexibility to model very  
general demand distributions, since we need only the ability to simulate  
demand to apply the method \(for example, one could allow for different  
coefficients of variation or correlations among the components of **D**\). In  
addition, the quality and complexity of the model can be controlled by  
varying the number of random samples Finally, unlike the DLP, it  
incorporates distributional information on demand.  
**3.3.3.2 Comparisons to DLP**  
To understand qualitatively how RLP compares with DLP, consider  
the following simple example\:  
**Example 3.4** Let \(a single resource\) and **A** = \[1\] \(one product\), so we have  
scalar values and It is easy to see that and  
so if *D* has a continuous distribution, then  
which is precisely Littlewood’s rule \(2.2\) for the expected marginal value of capacity.  
So the RLP method produces the exact expected marginal value in this case. In  
10The conditions essentially ensure that the linear program has a unique dual solution with  
probability one, so that the gradient with respect to **x** is well defined. However, they are  
somewhat difficult to verify in general. See Talluri and van Ryzin \[499\] for details. 100 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
contrast, the DLP method produces a marginal value of zero if and a  
marginal value of if —neither of which is correct.  
RLP also retains the desirable pooling property of the DLP method. Indeed,  
consider splitting up the demand *D* in this example into classes all with revenue  
such that Then it is not hard to see that for each realization of  
demand, the dual price is again if and  
if Thus, the expected dual price is unchanged.  
Example 3.4 suggests why the RLP method tends to produce a some-  
what better approximation of the marginal value of capacity than the  
DLP method.  
Figure 3.2 show some simulation comparisons of DLP and RLP on a  
hotel network. In these simulations, RLP provides a small but significant  
benefit in revenue over DLP at high occupancy. Nevertheless, methods  
like dynamic programming decomposition that we cover in Section 3.4.4  
tend to dominate both DLP and RLP.  
**3.4 Approximations Based on Decomposition**  
Another strategy for generating network controls is to decompose the  
problem into single-resource problems, each of which may incorpo-  
rate some network information but are solved essentially independently.  
Formally, one can think of such a decomposition method as follows. An *Network Capacity Control* 101  
approximation method decomposes the network problem into single-  
resource problems and applies a single-resource method on each re-  
source with value functions that depends on the time to go  
and the remaining capacity of resource These may be constructed  
by incorporating some static, network information into the estimates.  
Then the total value function is approximated by  
Typically, such approximations are discrete and yield bid prices  
where is the marginal expected value  
produced by the single-resource method applied to resource  
Decomposition approximations have several advantages relative to  
network approximations. First, because they are based on single-resource  
models, the displacement costs and bid prices are typically dynamic,  
varying as a function of capacity and time, and can be represented as a  
table of outputs \(in the case of dynamic programming models\) or sim-  
ple formulas \(in the case of EMSR approximations\). Thus, it is easy  
to quickly determine the effect of changes in both the remaining time  
and remaining capacity **x** on the bid prices. This should be contrasted  
with network models, which must be re-solved to determine the effects  
of such changes. Second, the simpler single-resource models used in de-  
composition approaches allow for more realistic assumptions, such as  
discrete demand and capacity, sequential decision making over time and  
stochastic dynamic demand.  
The primary disadvantage of decomposition methods is that in the  
process of separating the problem by resources one can lose important  
network information. Nevertheless, as we show below, hybrids of the two  
approaches can be used to try to achieve the benefits of both network  
and decomposition methods.  
**3.4.1 OD Factors Method**  
Origin-destination factors method, or *OD factors* method \(also called  
*heuristic bid price*\), is a simple type of decomposition approximation. In  
this method, one solves independent single-resource problems for each  
resource without making any prior adjustment to the input data for  
these problems. Typically, the total revenue of every product is used  
on each resource to solve a single-resource problem for that resource.  
The method may be either heuristic \(such as EMSR-b\) or exact \(such 102 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
as the dynamic program of Section 2.5\). Let the value functions from  
the problem on resource be denoted  
When evaluating a request for product on resource the price is  
compared with a bid price of the form  
where is the marginal value from the resource-level approx-  
imation method and is a global “OD factor” that tries to capture  
the displacement costs on resources other than Typically, and  
is tuned by simulation. If exceeds the OD factor bid price, then prod-  
uct is accepted on resource A similar calculation is performed on all  
other resources used by product Product is accepted if it is accepted  
on all these resources. In other words, should be greater than or equal  
to the maximum of the bid prices on the resources it consumes.  
Note the effect of this strategy. If product uses only resource then  
the decision is the same as that under the single-resource problem  
However, if product uses resources other than the bid price is higher  
than it would be under problem alone. Intuitively, this is as it should be  
since accepting product causes displacement at other resources  
in the network. The reason for the OD factor is that each single-  
resource problem tends to overestimate its own displacement cost as  
each problem uses the total revenue of each product, yet displacing a  
product that uses more than one resource frees up capacity elsewhere  
in the network, and the loss in gross revenue is partially offset by the  
marginal value of capacity that is freed up elsewhere in the network.  
The motivation for this OD factor approach is simply to take single-  
resource methods that one might already have in place and, in a simple  
way, convert their outputs into estimates of network displacement costs.  
Thus, it has the advantage of not requiring any new modeling or esti-  
mation. With proper tuning of the OD factor it can produce revenue  
benefits over simple, single-resource controls. Indeed, this later claim  
is almost immediate since recovers the single-resource strategy  
and another choice, of course, can potentially improve revenues further.  
Nevertheless, the choice of the parameter is quite ad hoc, and the al-  
ternative strategies that we present next almost always perform better.  
**3.4.2 Prorated EMSR**  
A slightly more sophisticated method for decomposition is to use pro-  
rated revenues in a collection of single-resource problems. The idea was  
first investigated by Williamson \[566\] with EMSR heuristics and is called  
the *prorated expected marginal seat revenue* \(PEMSR\) scheme. *Network Capacity Control* 103  
The PEMSR schemes involve allocating a portion of the revenue of  
each product to the resources used by the product. One then solves  
single-resource problems using an EMSR heuristic, though other single-  
resource methods can very well be substituted. The resulting marginal  
values from each resource are then used as bid prices in a bid-price con-  
trol scheme, or the allocations are used directly in resource-level nested  
allocation controls.  
Specifically, let be a nonnegative real vector. For  
each product define new revenues, one for each resource used by the  
product, by  
Next, treat each resource independently as if it received demand but  
with reduced revenue and solve the corresponding EMSR problem.  
The approximation to the value function is then  
where denotes the expected revenue of problem under  
the allocation  
Williamson \[566\] investigated several methods for determining the al-  
location weights in airline problems, including prorating based on  
mileage, number of resources, and the relative revenue value of local  
demand on each resource. Her conclusion is that none of these fixed  
allocations is very robust in general. Indeed, it is not hard to see that if  
one resource used by a product is highly congested and all others have  
abundant capacity, then the revenue of the product should be entirely al-  
located to the congested resource. Depending on the forecast of demand,  
however, the congested resource could be any of the resources used by  
the product; hence, no fixed allocation scheme can be expected to work  
well in all cases. Indeed, the iterative prorating schemes of Section 3.4.5  
below are partially motivated by this insight.  
**3.4.3 Displacement-Adjusted Virtual Nesting**  
# \(DAVN\)  
*Displacement-adjusted virtual nesting* \(DAVN\) starts with a set of  
static bid prices—or marginal value estimates—which we denote by  
These estimates may be obtained, for example, from one of  
the various network heuristic models presented in Section 3.3. Given the  
bid prices one then solves a single-resource problem on each resource  
as follows. 104 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
First, for all products that use a *displacement-adjusted revenue*  
is computed using  
That is, the revenue of product on resource price values of the other resources used by product is intended to approximate the net benefit of accepting product is reduced by the static bid  
This adjustment  
on  
11  
resource  
The next step is clustering, or *indexing.* In this step, the displacement-  
adjusted revenue values on each resource are clustered into a specified  
number of *virtual classes,* or *buckets.* \(The number of virtual classes,  
is a design parameter, but is typically on the order of 10. It may  
also vary across resources.\)  
The indexing from product to virtual class on each resource can be  
performed using a variety of algorithms. For example, one can simply  
look at the range of displacement-adjusted revenue values on a given re-  
source and split this range into equal intervals \(equal-revenue-width  
partitioning\). All products with displacement-adjusted revenues in the  
first interval are assigned to virtual class 1, all those with displacement-  
adjusted revenues in the second interval are assigned to virtual class 2,  
and so on. Because one would like the displacement-adjusted revenues in  
each virtual class to be roughly the same, more sophisticated clustering  
methods attempt to assign products to virtual classes so as to minimize  
some measure of the variation of displacement-adjusted revenue values  
within each virtual class. The particular indexing method and cluster-  
ing criteria are also design decisions and vary from implementation to  
implementation.  
The following is an example of an advanced indexing scheme used by  
American Airlines \(see Vinod \[537, 538\]\)\:  
**Example 3.5** \(DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING BASED INDEXING\) Consider a given re-  
source For ease of exposition, we assume that products are renumbered so that  
the displacement-adjusted revenue for product are ordered as follows\:12  
Let products\).  
denote the mean demand for product \(again under the revised numbering of  
11Observe that the displacement-adjusted revenue could be negative. In this case, product  
is never accepted on resource and typically we either eliminate product from the problem  
on resource or \(equivalently\) set the displacement-adjusted revenue value to zero.  
12This can be achieved by simply sorting the displacement-adjusted revenue values while  
keeping tracking of the original product numbers for each sorted value. *Network Capacity Control* 105  
We want to partition these products into assume that the partitions are contiguous so that if and belong to the same partition, then products the same partition. For a given contiguous partition deviation of revenue within partition by  
virtual classes. To do so, we first  
and both products  
also belong to  
define the squared  
where  
is the weighted-average displacement adjusted revenue for partition We would  
then like to find contiguous partitions that minimize the total sum of the squared  
deviations \(minimizes the total *within-group variation*\).  
This can be solved by dynamic programming as follows. Let minimum squared deviation possible when partitioning the products denote the  
into  
contiguous groups. Then  
with boundary conditions  
Starting with Then of this DP is groups, we solve \(3.16\) for successive values of until we reach  
gives the minimum total squared deviation, and by backtracking in  
the recursion \(3.16\) we can find the corresponding optimal partition. The complexity  
which is much more efficient than complete enumeration.  
Vinod \[537\] reports that this DP-based indexing method significantly  
improved the performance of American Airline’s virtual nesting imple-  
mentation \(by about 0.5%\) relative to their prior indexing scheme, which  
was based on a simple equal-revenue-width partitions. This suggests that  
the performance of DAVN is sensitive to the choice of indexing method.  
Indexing, however, is not a real-time process because changes to the  
virtual class mappings can be quite disruptive for both host reservation  
systems and human RM analysts alike; therefore it is usually performed  
only periodically.  
Once the virtual classes are formed and the indexing is determined, we  
compute a representative revenue value for each class—which is usually  
the \(mean demand\) weighted average displacement-adjusted revenue.  
Then, we compute the distribution of aggregate demand in a virtual class 106 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
by adding the means and variances of demand to come for all products  
that are indexed to that virtual class. Finally, we solve a single-resource  
problem \(using any standard single-resource method\) based on this data  
to determine protection levels on each resource. We call this problem  
This procedure yields a set of booking limits \(or protection levels\)  
for the virtual classes on each resource and a value-function estimate  
The control strategy then proceeds as follows. A request for product  
is converted into a request for the corresponding virtual class on each  
resource required by product using the indexing scheme. If the vir-  
tual class on each resource is available, the request is accepted. If the  
virtual class on one or more resources is closed, the request is rejected.  
Thus, once the indexing from products to virtual classes is performed,  
the control logic is an independent, nested allocation class-level control  
on each resource in the network. This is the primary appeal of—and  
motivation for—the method in the airline industry because it produces  
the sort of booking-class-level controls that are widely used by GDSs.  
An important point to note here is that even if the original prod-  
uct demand arrives in low-to-high *revenue* order, it is unlikely that the  
demand for virtual classes arrives in low-to-high *displacement-adjusted*  
*revenue* order. Thus, the revenue-order assumptions of the standard  
static single-resource model are likely to be violated under DAVN.  
Finally, to gain some intuition into DAVN, it is helpful to examine the  
control decisions that it produces on each resource. Assume, for illus-  
tration, that an exact static model is solved for each resource. Let  
denote the representative revenue value for virtual class on resource  
\(the weighted average or the median, depending on the implementa-  
tion\). By the optimality condition \(2.7\) for the single-resource model, a  
request on resource in virtual class is accepted if and only if  
Now if the indexing is done well, any product that is mapped into  
virtual class on resource should have a displacement-adjusted revenue  
close to hence, Substituting this approximation above  
and using the definition of \(3.15\), we then obtain \(approximately\)  
Observe the similarity of this condition to \(3.4\). In accepting a product  
in virtual class on resource we are \(approximately\) comparing its  
revenue to the sum of displacement costs on all resources it uses, where  
is a dynamic \(time and state-dependent\) approximation *Network Capacity Control* 107  
of the displacement cost on resource itself and the values are static  
approximations of the displacement cost on the other resources  
This heuristic connection to \(3.4\) illustrates the basic intuition  
behind the DAVN approach.  
**3.4.4 Dynamic Programming Decomposition**  
*Dynamic programming decomposition* is similar in spirit to DAVN in  
that it uses displacement-adjusted revenues to decompose the network  
into a series of resource-level problems. Indeed, the only real difference is  
that while DAVN takes displacement-adjusted revenues and aggregates  
them into a small number of virtual classes, in dynamic programming  
decomposition, the revenue and demand remains disaggregated. As with  
other decomposition methods, there are several possible variations to  
the basic approach. However, for purposes of illustration we focus on  
one special case here—specifically, the dynamic single-resource model in  
which demand for product arrives in period with probability  
\(Using the dynamic model, one also does not have to worry about making  
a low-before-high revenue-order assumptions, which as in DAVN is likely  
to be violated as a result of the displacement-adjusted revenue step.\)  
We start the decomposition as in DAVN with a static vector of bid  
price Again, this may be computed in a variety of ways—say, using  
one of the network math programming models of Section 3.3. Then for  
each resource we solve a single-resource dynamic program based on  
displacement-adjusted revenues. That is, for each product that uses  
resource compute the displacement-adjusted revenue  
Then formulate a dynamic single-resource problem for resource \(prob-  
lem \) with arrival rates and revenues Let the resulting value  
function be denoted The total value function approximation  
is then  
and the bid prices are given by  
where is the marginal value from problem  
Because dynamic programming decomposition is so similar to DAVN,  
the choice of which one to use is most often dictated by the control  
strategy one wants to use in the end. If the objective is to construct 108 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
virtual nesting controls, then aggregating and indexing as in DAVN will  
accurately match the control strategy. If one is using bid-price controls,  
then the aggregating and indexing of DAVN is not necessary, and a  
dynamic programming decomposition will tend to yield more accurate  
bid price approximations, and a bid price table \(see Table 3.1\) for better  
control.  
**3.4.5 Iterative Decomposition Methods**  
*Iterative decomposition methods* are also closely related to DAVN. The  
methods were originally based on the EMSR heuristics for the single-  
resource problem and so were called *iterative prorated EMSR* methods,  
but there are several variations of the general idea, and it can be used  
with any single-resource model. We look at two basic versions that differ  
primarily in the way they convert product revenues into resource-level  
revenues.  
**3.4.5.1 Iterative DAVN**  
Iterative DAVN is essentially a method for computing the static bid  
prices used by DAVN. The motivation for the approach is heuristic  
but intuitively appealing. Suppose that indeed represents the marginal  
displacement cost vector. Then once DAVN is solved, for consistency we  
should have that  
where the marginal value generated by  
problem at the current time That is, the marginal costs produced  
by the DAVN decomposition should match our static estimate  
A natural question arises then. What happens if  
The idea of iterative DAVN is that if these values do not match, we  
simply feed back the estimates as new static bid prices into  
the procedure and recompute the DAVN models.  
Formally, let denote the static bid price at iteration in the  
algorithm. The algorithm proceeds as follows\:  
# STEP 0 \(Initialize\)\:  
Initialize to an arbitrary starting value \(say, zero\).  
**STEP 1 \(Compute new displacement-adjusted revenues\)\:**  
FOR DO\:  
Compute the displacement-adjusted revenues for each product on *Network Capacity Control* 109  
resource using  
FOR  
DO\:  
Cluster and index the products into virtual classes on resource and  
solve a single-resource problem to generate the value-function esti-  
mates and the marginal value estimates  
# STEP 2 \(Check for Convergence\)\:  
IF for STOP.  
ELSE  
and GOTO STEP 1.  
Abstractly, this algorithm produces a mapping bid price vectors onto itself. That is, terminates if it finds a fixed point of this map, from the space of  
The algorithm  
However,  
whether is a contraction mapping or not is not known, so convergence  
of this method is not always guaranteed.  
# 3.4.5.2 Iterative Prorated EMSR  
*Iterative prorated EMSR*—denoted IEMSR—is nearly equivalent to  
iterated DAVN except that it uses prorated rather than displacement-  
adjusted revenues. It was originally proposed using the EMSR-b ap-  
proximation, but other single-resource methods could be used in place  
of EMSR-b.  
Iterative prorated EMSR simply replaces Step 1 of the iterative DAVN  
algorithm with the following\:  
# STEP 1 \(Modified\)\:  
FOR DO\:  
Compute the prorated revenues on each resource as  
used by product 110 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
FOR DO\:  
Cluster and index the products into virtual classes and use the EMSR-  
b method for the decomposed problem on resource to generate the  
value-function estimates and the marginal value esti-  
mates 13  
That is, the revenue used for product in problem is a prorated  
revenue based on the static bid price vector New static bid prices  
are then formed using the marginal values from an EMSR algorithm,  
and the procedure is repeated. This continues until the marginal values  
produced by the EMSR algorithm equal the static bid prices  
Again, this iteration can be viewed as a mapping of the form  
However, unlike the mapping produced by iterative DAVN,  
Bratu \[87\] has shown that the mapping produced by iterative prorated  
EMSR is a contraction mapping under certain conditions; namely, when  
the demand is left disaggregated \(there is no indexing to virtual classes\)  
and the EMSR-b heuristic is used. Thus, this version of the algorithm  
always converges to a set of bid prices that satisfy  
**3.4.5.3 Comments on Convergence of Iterative Methods**  
While convergence guarantees are somewhat reassuring, one has to be  
careful not to read too much into this fact. Indeed, despite the intuitive  
appeal and simplicity of iterative methods, there are counterexamples  
that show that the resulting convergent bid prices can be quite bad.  
Consider the following example\:  
**Example 3.6** Consider a three-resource line network, with nodes A, B, C, and D.  
Each of the three resources AB, BC, and CD has one unit of capacity. Suppose there  
are *T =* 2 periods and we have data for itinerary arrivals as shown in Table 3.3. If  
we start with static bid price prorate the revenues in period 1  
by these weights and then compute the exact expected marginal value of each leg, we  
get a new static set of bid prices and We can  
then prorate by these new bid prices and repeat the procedure.  
The results of repeated applications of this procedure are shown in Table 3.4. Note  
that the bid prices converge to and However, by  
inspection of the data in Table 3.3, it is clear that we want to reject both of the  
itineraries arriving in period 1, so we need and Such a policy  
13How to compute the EMSR-b marginal value is somewhat nonobvious, but it can be ob-  
tained easily using the functions where, as defined in Section 2.2.4,  
is the weighted-average revenue for classes and higher and is the aggregate demand  
for class and higher. Taking the maximum provides a \(heuristic\) marginal-revenue curve  
for the EMSR-b model. *Network Capacity Control*  
111  
yields an expected revenue of \$1,000. Because the iterative proration scheme produces  
zero bid prices for legs AB and CD, it accepts both products AB and CD in period  
1, generating an expected revenue of only \$100—only 10% of the optimal revenue.  
This example illustrates that iterative methods, even though they  
converge, may not converge to values that yield good approximations of  
the network opportunity cost. Despite such examples, the methods have  
worked well in simulation studies.  
**3.5 Stochastic Gradient Methods**  
Another class of methods for network capacity control uses simulation  
to optimize over a parametric family of control policies. Here, we look  
at optimizing the nested protection levels of a virtual nesting scheme.  
The idea is to first fix an indexing scheme and a nesting order on each  
resource \(for example, using DAVN\) and then to set nested protection  
levels \(or booking limits\) for each resource based on this nesting order.  
Using a network-level simulation, one can generate samples of de-  
mand and compute stochastic gradients—“noisy” estimates of the par-  
tial derivatives of the network revenue with respect to the protection-  
level parameters of the control policy. This gradient information can  
then be used in a steepest decent algorithm to search for a network-  
optimal \(rather than resource-level optimal\) set of protection-level pa-  
rameters. 112 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
One version of the approach is based on a continuous-demand,  
continuous-capacity model that allows for gradient calculations. We look  
at this method in detail, since it is the simplest and most direct method.  
Discrete versions of the approach, which rely on first difference rather  
than gradient sensitivity estimates, are also discussed briefly afterwards.  
**3.5.1 Continuous Model with Gradient Estimates**  
Assume continuous demands and capacities in the network model.  
Let a realization of a sample path of network demand, denoted be  
defined by a sequence of customer requests  
where *N* is the total number of customers in the sequence \(a random  
variable\), indexes the individual customers \(in order of arrival\), is  
the product requested by customer and is the quantity of product  
requested. In general, could be any nonnegative quantity \(such  
as a request for one unit or a batch request for five units\). We can  
generate these sample paths by essentially any demand model we like,  
with no significant restrictions on the distribution \(the only one being  
that *N* is finite w.p.1\). For example, there could be arbitrary order of  
arrivals, demands could be correlated or coefficients of variation could  
be arbitrary. This level of generality in the demand model is one of the  
primary advantages of simulation-based optimization methods.  
We assume there are virtual classes on each resource. Let  
denote the protection level for virtual class and higher on resource  
\(We assume for notational convenience that for all \) Let  
denote the vector of all protection  
levels. The protection levels are nested on each resource, so we require  
where is the capacity of resource Let the set of all **y** satisfying these  
constraints be denoted A request for product is mapped to virtual  
class on each resource used by product according to the fixed  
indexing scheme.  
Request for an amount of product is processed as  
follows. First, let denote the vector of remaining capacities at the  
time request arrives. The available capacity for product on each  
resource is then That is, the remaining capacity  
on minus the protection level for virtual classes higher than the  
virtual class of or zero if this difference is negative. The amount of  
the request accepted, denoted is given by the minimum  
available capacity among all the resources required by product or if  
there are at least units of capacity on all of these resources. Formally, *Network Capacity Control* 113  
Note here that we are allowing the system to partially accept a request  
if the available capacity is positive but less than the quantity that  
is requested. This assumption is necessary to make the revenue on the  
sample path, denoted a smooth function of the protection levels  
**y**. Indeed, one can show that is continuous and piecewise linear  
in **y** and always has right and left derivatives with respect to each  
Our objective is to maximize the expected revenue, over  
the set of feasible protection levels  
One method for solving this problem is to use an iterative gradient pro-  
jection method of the form  
where denotes a projection of the point **x** onto the set  
is the gradient of and are appropriately  
selected step sizes. The difficulty is computing However,  
if we can interchange expectation and differentiation, so that  
the gradient can be approximated by the *stochastic gra-*  
*dient* the gradient of the revenue with respect to **y** on the  
single sample path which is a random vector. One can use either an  
average of a sample of such stochastic gradients as an estimate, or just a  
single sample. Using the latter leads to the following stochastic gradient  
method\:  
If the step sizes are nonnegative and satisfy and  
and the stochastic demand sequence satisfies a bounded variance  
condition,14 then the algorithm can be shown to converge \(w.p.1\) to at  
least a stationary point of the optimization problem \(3.18\).15  
**3.5.1.1 Sample Path Gradient Calculation**  
Of course, we must be able to compute the sample path gradient  
efficiently. For the continuous model presented here this can  
14For example, will do, but other more effective, adaptive step-size rules are  
available.  
15These claims are deliberately informal. The reader is refereed to Bertsekas and Tsitsik-  
lis \[55\] and Ermoliev \[178\] for precise conditions and convergence results on stochastic, iter-  
ative algorithms of this type. These references also discuss step-size selection and stopping  
criteria. 114 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
be accomplished through a recursive calculation that—although some-  
what messy algebraically—is not much more complex than simulating  
the acceptance policy itself.  
To proceed, define to be the revenue to go over arrivals  
starting with a vector of remaining capacities and  
protection levels **y**. We then have the following set of recursive *forward*  
*equations* for determining the revenues  
for with boundary condition **x**\(1\) = **x** and  
The total sample path revenue is given by  
By taking derivatives through this recursion, one can come up with a  
gradient The details of this computation are summarized  
in Appendix 3.A, but it results in a simple and efficient recursion for  
determining the gradients based on a sample simulation of the network  
demand.  
The main advantage of this simulation-based optimization approach is  
that the resulting gradients accurately estimate the true network revenue  
effects of perturbing **y**. Moreover, as mentioned, the procedure is at  
least locally convergent, so given good starting values it can potentially  
find the network-optimal set of virtual nesting protection levels. At a  
minimum, it is at least guaranteed to improve on any given initial set of  
protection levels **y**. The disadvantage of the approach, however, is that  
it can become computationally intensive.  
**3.5.1.2 Numerical Example**  
A numerical example from \[528\] illustrates the behavior of the sto-  
chastic gradient algorithm. Here we consider an airline network with  
five cities \(nodes\) and eight legs \(resources\) with 10 round-trip itineraries  
and four fare classes per itinerary, producing 80 products as shown in  
Figure 3.3. The data in Table 3.5 is from Williamson \[566\]. Demands  
are assumed normally distributed with a standard deviation equal to the  
square root of the mean. Each leg has the same capacity, which is varied  
to generate different load factors. A version of DAVN as described in  
Section 3.4.3 is used to define the indexing and find the initial set of pro-  
tection levels. The results shown below are for 5,000 instances \(sample  
paths\) run with the stochastic gradient method to improve on the initial  
protection levels. Tables 3.6 and 3.7 show an example of the protection  
levels produced by DAVN and the improved protection levels produced  
by the stochastic gradient algorithm. Note that protection levels are  
increased on some legs and decreased on others. Some virtual classes *Network Capacity Control* 115  
are, in fact, “merged” \(virtual classes 1 and 2 are merged on the first  
two legs; virtual classes 1, 2, and 3 are merged on leg 4\). Virtual class  
4 “disappears” on legs 1, 2, 5, and 6, meaning that there is no specific  
capacity reserved for it. The same thing happens to virtual class 3 on  
legs 6 and 7. In these examples, the improved protection levels produce  
dramatically increased revenues \(on the order of 5%\), though this was  
largely because the DAVN policy used theft nesting without any reop- 116 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
timizations. More frequent reoptimization improves both methods and  
narrows the performance gap, but the stochastic gradient method still  
improves the performance of DAVN significantly.  
**3.5.2 Discrete Model with First-Difference**  
# Estimates  
Using simulation-based optimization of nested allocation controls first  
appeared in a method proposed by Bertsimas and de Boer \[60\]. We only  
outline their method because it is somewhat involved and is similar to  
the continuous model discussed above. There are two key differences in  
their approach, however. First, it is based on a discrete demand, discrete  
capacity, and discrete parameter model, where each request is assumed  
to be for a single unit of capacity for all and the requests  
are either fully accepted or rejected. The protection levels **y** are also  
integral. The resulting model is more realistic, but one must use first-  
difference \(rather than gradient\) estimates, which cannot be computed as *Network Capacity Control* 117  
efficiently as in the continuous model. In addition, because it is a discrete  
problem, even local convergence is not guaranteed. Second, because  
of the complexity of propagating first-difference estimates, Bertsimas  
and de Boer use an approximation of the revenue to go to simplify the  
computation, so the method provides only approximate estimates of the  
first differences. This approximation, however, also accounts for the  
value of reoptimization \(it is a true value-function estimate\), which adds  
another refinement to the simulation-based approach. Here, however, we  
focus only on the simulation-based optimization portion of their overall  
approach.  
As before, let represent the revenue from a sample path and  
let be the revenue to go over arrivals starting  
with a vector of remaining capacities and protection levels **y**. Again,  
we have a set of recursive forward equations for determining the revenues  
where is either 0 or 1. Since the model is discrete, one must  
look at first-difference estimates of sensitivity—that is,  
where **y**.  
is the unit vector corresponding to parameter in the vector  
However, in contrast to the differential changes in the continuous  
model, propagating discrete changes using the above recursion cannot  
be done in parallel for all parameters **y**. Rather, one must trace the  
effects of the change for each parameter in a separate calculation,  
though only protection levels that are binding need to be calculated.  
Since this is too computationally complex to be practical for large  
networks, one can approximate the effects of a discrete change by sim-  
ulating for a small number of arrivals and using an approximation  
to estimate the revenue effects from time onward. Bert-  
simas and de Boer \[60\] propose using a piecewise linear approximation  
to the revenue function, based on recursively applying the stochastic  
first-difference estimates over a successive number of periods.  
That is, divide the problem into periods. In the last period, the first-  
difference estimates are computed exactly for a sample of simulation  
runs. The resulting averaged first differences are then used to form a  
piecewise linear approximation of the revenue function in the last pe-  
riod. In the second-to-last period, the simulation estimates of the first  
differences are run again, but the approximation of the revenue function  
is used to estimate the revenue effects over the last period. The resulting 118 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
first-difference estimates for the second-to-last period are then used to  
form a piecewise approximation of the revenue function in that period,  
and so on.  
Again, the complete method is somewhat involved, and the reader is  
referred to Bertsimas and de Boer \[60\] for details. However, in their tests,  
the method was computationally manageable and effective at improving  
the revenue performance of the initial protection levels. The improve-  
ments increased with load factor and ranged from 0.0 to 0.75%. These  
results again suggest the potential to improve protection-level policies  
using simulation-based optimization methods.  
**3.6 Asymptotic Analysis of Network Problems**  
Some asymptotic results have been proven for network problems,  
which we briefly review here. The analysis essentially looks at the per-  
formance of different policies as the capacity and demand are scaled  
up by the same factor. It gives a rigorous—albeit somewhat crude—  
characterization of optimal network policies. The first set of results  
relates to partitioned controls, and the second to bid-price controls.  
**3.6.1 Asymptotic Optimality of Partitioned**  
# Controls  
We first consider simple partitioned allocation controls generated by  
the deterministic linear programming approximation of Section 3.3.1.  
Our analysis here is based on Cooper \[131\]. Consider the linear program  
\(3.6\), which we restate here\:  
provides an upper bound on the expected revenue from any dynamic  
allocation policy. This follows because any policy will have a cumulative  
vector of product sales **y** that satisfies and pathwise.  
Thus, *E*\[**N**\] is a feasible solution to the linear program \(3.22\). This,  
together with Jensen’s inequality \(see Appendix B\) shows that is an  
upper bound on  
Moreover, an optimal solution **y**\* defines partitioned allocations  
for each product These partitions may not be integral, but in the  
limiting case we consider here this is not significant, and hence we ignore  
integrality. The \(random\) revenue produced by this allocation, denoted *Network Capacity Control* 119  
is given by  
Let be a positive integer and consider a sequence of such problems  
indexed by with capacities and demand vectors such  
that and  
where denotes convergence in distribution. For example, could be  
constructed by adding i.i.d. vectors **D**, in which case the above follows  
by the law of large numbers. In this sequence of problems, demand and  
capacity are scaled up proportionately by a factor  
We can define a sequence of linear programs denoted analogous  
to \(3.22\) by  
and is again an upper bound on the optimal expected revenue,  
in problem Also, note that and that is  
the optimal solution to the scaled problem. Finally, the random revenue  
produced by this solution is  
Now a simple scaling of these expressions by shows that  
where the last convergence follows from the continuity of the min\{·\}  
function. 120 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Thus, the scaled revenue of the partitioned allocation policy converges  
in distribution to a constant; namely, the upper bound, Hence, the  
revenue of the partitioned allocation policy converges almost surely to  
the optimal revenue.  
**3.6.2 Asymptotic Optimality of Bid-Price**  
# Controls  
One can also show that bid-price controls have good asymptotic prop-  
erties in the same scaling of the problem. The details of the analysis are  
somewhat involved, but here we provide a brief description of the main  
results.  
Consider a sequence of scaled deterministic linear programs as in  
\(3.22\). It is not hard to show that the dual prices for each program  
in this sequence of problems are constant because the capacity and de-  
mand are multiplied by the same factor Let denote this vector of  
dual prices. Using this vector of dual prices, one can define a fixed bid-  
price heuristic in which we accept a request for product with revenue  
if and only if there is sufficient capacity and  
One can then show via upper and lower bounds that the expected  
revenue produced by this fixed bid-price heuristic converges \(in ratio\)  
to the optimal expected revenue as the scale parameter increases.16  
In particular, the expected revenue of the fixed-price heuristic is within  
of the upper bound on the optimal expected revenue given  
by \(3.22\). Since the is this shows the relative suboptimality  
of the fixed bid-price heuristic tends to zero as increases.  
For one, this result shows that, asymptotically, optimal bid prices are  
constant. That is, a set of constant bid prices will be near optimal in  
this scaling of the problem when demand and capacity are large. This  
suggests that even though bid prices may be volatile, one should not  
expect to see much of a drift in bid-price values over time, at least  
for large problem instances. In addition, because the asymptotically  
optimal bid prices are based on the DLP model, the results provide  
some theoretical support for using DLP to compute bid prices.  
**3.6.3 Comments on Asymptotic Optimality**  
While these asymptotic results provide some theoretical insights, their  
practical value is debatable. What these asymptotic results provide is,  
essentially, a characterization of the first-order properties of a given pol-  
16In this case, it is convergence of the expected values and not convergence in probability as  
in the partitioned allocation case. *Network Capacity Control* 121  
icy. That is, the analysis *averages out* the randomness in the problem  
and leaves only the mean demand effects. \(Note that the asymptotic  
bounds above depend only on the mean demand.\) So we can conclude  
that bid prices based on partitioned allocations of the deterministic lin-  
ear program \(3.22\) will produce the optimal first-order revenues in this  
sense.  
However, this asymptotic first-order optimality is a rather crude mea-  
sure of performance. One would certainly be suspicious of a policy that  
does *not* have this property; but the fact that a policy does achieve  
first-order optimality does not mean it is necessarily effective in prac-  
tical settings. For example, the partitioned allocation policy typically  
performs poorly in practice, despite the fact that it is first-order optimal.  
**3.7 Decentralized Network Control\: Airline**  
# Alliances  
Thus far, we have looked at network control from the standpoint of a  
single firm that manages the capacity of all network resources. However,  
there are many instances where no single firm controls all of a network’s  
resources. For example, in hotel chains or car rental operations, individ-  
ual locations may be owned and operated by a franchisee who operates  
as a profit center, yet there may be demands for multilocation stays or  
one-way rentals that impact more than one of these locations. In the  
airline industry, alliances between major carriers create integrated net-  
works that jointly market products—code shared flights or connections  
between the carriers’ networks, for example—but each firm has a sep-  
arate profit motive. The management of such *decentralized networks* is  
a relatively new problem area in RM. Here we briefly review this topic,  
focusing on the case of airline alliances.  
Alliances provide a variety of benefits in a network industry like air  
transport. For one, airlines can cross-list each other’s flights through  
*code-sharing* arrangements, in which the same physical flight is listed un-  
der different flight numbers, one for each partner airline in the alliance.  
When two networks are combined, connecting flights between one car-  
rier’s network and another are created, which again can be cross-listed  
and marketed by each carrier. Alliances also create economies of scale  
in providing ground services such as checking, baggage handling, and  
passenger lounges. Finally, the consolidation of loyalty programs ben-  
efits consumers. Indeed, in many ways airlines alliances achieve many  
of the benefits of an outright merger without the attendant labor and  
regulatory difficulties.  
Yet airline alliances have created new challenges for RM. On an oper-  
ational level, one must find some mechanism for controlling the capacity 122 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
on shared flights. The two broad categories of mechanisms used by air-  
lines are the following\:  
**Blocked-seat allotment** In a blocked-seat allotment, the carriers  
agree to partition the capacity of shared flights, with each carrier  
having individual control over its allotment of seats. The allotments  
may be updated periodically in various ways, but fundamentally the  
seat inventory is managed as if it were two “virtual” flights, each one  
controlled independently by its respective alliance partner.  
**Free sale** Under free sale, capacity is not partitioned. Rather, the  
carrier that is operating a flight provides some form of dynamic avail-  
ability information to its alliance partners. For example, it may pro-  
vide information about which booking classes are available and how  
much capacity is available in each class. The nonoperating alliance  
partners can then book seats subject to the capacity controls set by  
the operating carrier. Alternatively, it may provide bid-price infor-  
mation, in essence providing a spot price for the capacity at a given  
point in time. The alliance partner may then sell the seat under some  
revenue and cost-sharing terms that depend on the bid price.  
While blocked-seat allotment is simpler operationally, it is not hard  
to see, just as with partitioned controls in a centralized network, that  
it can be quite suboptimal to divide capacity this way\: one firm may  
have excess capacity in its allotment and no demand, while another may  
be sold out and be turning away requests. At the same time, parti-  
tioned allocations can usually be accommodated within the current RM  
practices of alliance partners. Free sale, while offering more flexibility  
and the potential to provide enhanced revenues, is considerably more  
complex to manage.  
But beyond the simple mechanics of sharing capacity, firms in an al-  
liance must find coordinated policies for managing their shared resources.  
Moreover, they must do this in a way that provides proper incentives for  
each party involved. For example, Boyd \[86\] argues that using bid prices  
as a transfer price for charging alliance partners for seat capacity can co-  
ordinate alliance revenues. His analysis is based on linear programming  
theory.  
**3.8 Notes and Sources**  
The earliest reports and articles on network problems in the airline  
industry are D’Sylva \[163\], Glover et al. \[215\], and Wang \[550\]. Dror et  
al. \[162\] also analyze a network flow model that allows for deterministic *Network Capacity Control* 123  
cancellations on the arcs. See also network models by Phillips et al. \[418\],  
Wong \[578\], Wong et al. \[577\], and Wysong \[584\].  
Bid-price controls were first introduced by Smith and Penn \[478\] and  
Simpson \[476\]. Williamson’s thesis \[565, 566\] provides variations of bid-  
price controls and provides detailed simulation comparisons with other  
control methods. See also Phillips \[419\] for an analysis of using and  
computing marginal values.  
The basic theoretical properties and asymptotic analysis of bid-  
price controls in Section 3.2 and Section 3.6 are from Talluri and van  
Ryzin \[498\] as is the bid-price counterexamples. The nonoptimality of  
bid prices was first raised by Curry \[140\], who used an analogy to the  
Taylor series expansion of the value function to argue that second-order  
“interaction” terms may be significant in determining optimal revenue  
thresholds. The asymptotic analysis of partitioned controls is due to  
Cooper \[131\]. For path-wise theoretical bounds, see Cooper \[130\].  
As for the approximation methods in Section 3.3, the determinis-  
tic linear program \(DLP\) was among the first models analyzed in the  
early work of D’Sylva \[163\], Glover et al. \[215\], Dror et al. \[162\], and  
Wong \[578, 577\]. Wollmer \[575\] proposed the first linear programming  
version of the PNLP model. A specialized nonlinear programming al-  
gorithm for the PNLP model is provided by Ciancimino et al. \[118\].  
Chen et al. \[111, 112\] investigate a bid-price approximation that com-  
bines both the DLP and PNLP value function approximations using  
multivariate adaptive regression splines \(MARS\). The randomized lin-  
ear programming method was first discussed in Smith and Penn \[478\]  
but was investigated in detail in Talluri and van Ryzin \[499\]. A cutting  
plane method for joint pricing and allocation in network RM is provided  
in Garcia-Diaz and Kuyumcu \[201\].  
Descriptions of virtual nesting can be found in Belobaba’s thesis \[39\],  
Smith and Penn \[478\], Williamson \[565, 566\], and Vinod \[537, 538\].  
Vinod \[537\] provided an algorithm for the indexing step of virtual nest-  
ing. Curry \[139\] analyzes a similar scheme in which classes are nested  
by origin and destination.  
The iterative methods for computing bid prices in Section 3.4.5  
can be found in several sources, including Williamson \[565, 566\] and  
Phillips \[419\]. Bratu’s master’s thesis \[87\] provides an analysis of the  
iterative EMSR method and related network approximations.  
The discrete stochastic gradient method in Section 3.5.2 for updating  
virtual nesting booking parameters was first proposed by Bertsimas and  
de Boer \[60\]; the continuous gradient model in Section 3.5.1 is due to  
van Ryzin and Vulcano \[528\]. 124 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The discussion of airline alliances in Section 3.7 is based on Boyd \[86\].  
See also Brueckner and Spiller \[89\].  
The network RM model with passenger routing control and customer-  
choice behavior was investigated by Talluri \[501\]. Gallego, Iyengar and  
Phillips \[197\] propose a more elaborate model with an airline offering  
flexible products \(at a lower price\) and customers self-selecting according  
to a discrete-choice model.  
Finally, we note that in this section we largely ignore the stochastic  
programming \(Birge and Louveauz \[68\]\) approach, as there have been,  
to our knowledge, no RM implementations that use such techniques  
directly. However, the basic ideas behind the DLP and RLP approxima-  
tions are in fact standard ones in stochastic programming, de Boer et  
al. \[154\] also apply stochastic programming ideas \(i.e., scenario aggrega-  
tion\) to network RM.  
# APPENDIX 3.A\: Computation of Sample Path Gra-  
# dients  
To compute the sample path by gradients, we start by differentiating \(3.20\) and  
\(3.21\) with respect to **y** and **x**, respectively, to obtain the set of *backward equations*  
for the derivatives with respect to  
Similarly, a set of backward equations for the derivative with respect to is\:  
with boundary conditions  
\(The reason for the use of the right and left derivatives above is somewhat subtle and  
is explained in detail in \[528\].\) *APPENDIX 3.A*\: *Computation of Sample Path Gradients* Finally, from \(3.17\) we have that for all and  
125  
In words, the quantity of demand accepted from a request for product in state  
**x** is reduced \(one for one\) by a slight increase in the protection level if and only  
if all of the following hold\: \(1\) resource is used by \(2\) the capacity available on  
resource is a binding constraint, \(3\) the amount accepted is positive but constrained  
by the protection levels, \(4\) class is higher in the nesting order than the virtual class  
of product and \(5\) the protection level for class is binding. In all other cases, a  
small change in does not affect the amount of product we accept.  
These conditions are further illustrated in Figures 3.A.1 and 3.A.2, which show a  
request at time for units of product that uses resources 1, 2, and 3. The height  
of the bars represents the capacity remaining at time and the quantities  
represent the protection levels for product on each resource The unshaded areas  
therefore represent the capacity available for product on each of the three resources.  
Note in Figures 3.A.1 that there is sufficient capacity available on all three resources  
to fully satisfy the request for product so Thus, a small increase in  
will not affect the quantity of product accepted in this time period, and therefore  
for all However, as shown in Figure 3.A.2, the requested  
quantity exceeds the available capacity on resources 1 and 3, and the quantity accepted  
is constrained by the protection-level constraint on resource 3, so  
In this case, a small increase in will reduce the amount of product that  
we accept in this period, so An increase in any of the  
other protection levels on resources 1 and 2, however, will not affect the quantity  
accepted because these protection levels are not binding. This example illustrates the  
conditions leading to \(3.A.3\).  
A similar reasoning provides the left derivatives with respect to  
The recursions \(3.20\)–\(3.21\) and \(3.A.1\)–\(3.A.2\) together with \(3.A.3\) and \(3.A.4\)  
provide the basis for an efficient method for computing the sample path gradient.  
First, generate a sample sequence of demand and use \(3.20\)-\(3.21\) to compute  
the sequence of acceptance decisions and remaining capacities by  
simulating the system forward in time. With these data in hand, starting from *N*  
and working backward in time down to use \(3.A.1\)-\(3.A.2\) to compute the  
derivatives backward in time. The resulting set of derivative values for give the  
gradient estimate of with respect to both **y** and **x**. The complexity of the 126 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
backward pass for computing the gradient is the same as simulating the allocation  
decisions in the forward pass. *APPENDIX 3.A\: Computation of Sample Path Gradients* 127This page intentionally left blankChapter 4  
# OVERBOOKING  
Overbooking is somewhat distinct from the core pricing and capacity-  
control problems of revenue management. RM is mainly concerned with  
how best to price or allocate capacity—how to achieve the best *mix*  
of demand, in essence. In contrast, overbooking is concerned with in-  
creasing capacity utilization in a reservation-based system when there  
are significant cancellations.1 Its focus is increasing the total *volume* of  
sales in the presence of cancellations rather than optimizing customer  
mix. The problems of optimizing demand mix and volume are quite  
related, however, and both are considered integral parts of RM.  
Indeed, from a historical standpoint, overbooking is the oldest—and,  
in financial terms, among the most successful—of RM practices. In the  
airline industry it is estimated that approximately 50% of reservations  
result in cancellations or no-shows2 and about 15% of all seats would go  
unsold without some form of overbooking. \[477\] This is to be compared  
to fare-class allocation, which by most estimates leads to incremental  
revenues to the order of 5%. Despite its economic importance, many  
researchers consider overbooking a somewhat mature area, and it has  
1We note, however, that reservations are not used in all quantity-based RM industries. In  
certain advertising markets, for example, one advertiser is allowed to preempt another if it’is  
willing to pay more for the same ad slot. This effectively produces an auction in which the  
current highest bidder has claim to the capacity.  
2A *cancellation* is defined as a reservation that is terminated by a customer strictly *prior*  
to the time of service. A no-show, in contrast, occurs when a customer does not cancel his  
reservation but rather just fails to show up at the time of service. The distinction is important  
because the firm has some opportunity to compensate for a cancellation by accepting more  
reservations after the fact, while no such opportunities exist when a customer no-shows. 130 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
received less attention in the recent research literature than fare-class  
allocation or pricing.  
As a business practice, the biggest challenges in overbooking are man-  
aging the negative effects of denying service on customer relations and  
dealing with the resulting legal and regulatory issues. On a planning  
level, overbooking involves controlling the level of reservations to bal-  
ance the potential risks of denied service against the rewards of increased  
sales. Theoretically, this involves controlling parameters of a probabil-  
ity distribution, which introduces somewhat unique methodology that is  
not encountered in other areas of RM.  
**4.1 Business Context and Overview**  
A reservation is essentially a forward contract between a customer  
and the firm. Reservations give customers the right to use a service in  
the future at a fixed price and often also the option to opt out \(perhaps  
with a penalty\) before the time of service.  
Customers value reservations whenever the costs of unavailability at  
the desired time of consumption are higher than the costs of unavailabil-  
ity prior to the time of consumption. For instance, because customers  
travel to attend business meetings, visit family members, or take vaca-  
tions, they must coordinate their travel with hotel arrangements, busi-  
ness appointments, scheduling of vacation days, and so on. Since it is  
generally more costly to change or renege on these contingent arrange-  
ments at the time of service than it is to change or renege on them in  
advance, customers value reservations for travel services.  
Yet committing to purchasing in advance has its own risks. Uncertain  
future events \(such as clients rescheduling meetings, illness, or more at-  
tractive vacation opportunities\) may make it impossible or undesirable  
to use the service. Therefore, customers also value the option to cancel  
reservations. Indeed, a reservation with a cancellation option gives cus-  
tomers the best of both worlds—the benefit of locking-in availability in  
advance and the flexibility to renege should their plans or preferences  
change.  
While advance reservations with a cancellation option are highly val-  
ued by customers, they require a firm to take a two-sided risk—to honor  
the reservation when customers show up \(or provide suitable compen-  
sation if it cannot honor the reservation\), and in cases where customers  
cancel or do not show up, to bear the opportunity cost of wasted capac-  
ity. Firms try to manage this risk through a combination of cancellation  
penalties and overbooking.  
Cancellation and no-show penalties effectively allow customers and  
the firm to share the risks of cancellations. In practice, penalties for *Overbooking* 131  
cancellations and no-shows range from zero to full price and are most  
often implemented as a sale condition of the product. In fact, the po-  
tential for abuse without such penalties is substantial; customers may  
make multiple reservations to preserve various options and then cancel  
all of them except the one they want, not an uncommon practice in cer-  
tain wholesale international air travel markets. Some minimal penalty  
is necessary to curb such abuses. \(Though firms in a surprising num-  
ber of industries—the restaurant industry for one—do not penalize for  
cancellations.\) On the other hand, if the penalties are too large, the  
cancellation option has little value or effectively becomes a nonoption  
for customers.  
To further reduce the costs of cancellations, a firm may also adopt a  
strategy of accepting more reservations than it has capacity to serve, tak-  
ing the chance that the number of surviving reservations will be within  
capacity. This is the essence of planned overbooking.  
A firm that chooses a strategy of planned overbooking is immediately  
faced with several important problems. One is confronting the legal and  
regulatory implications of failing to honor the reservation contract. Even  
if the firm is on safe legal ground, it must have operational policies and  
procedures in place to deal with the situation in which service must be  
denied. Once these basic structural and policy elements are determined,  
it must develop methodology to control the level of overbooking on an  
operational basis. We look at each of these issues in turn.  
**4.1.1 A History of Legal Issues in Airline**  
# Overbooking  
Legally, overbooking involves the risk of failing to deliver on a contract  
to provide service. While there are somewhat different legal requirements  
in each industry in this regard, it is instructive to look at the evolution  
of airline overbooking regulations in the United States as an example of  
the legal issues involved.  
Prior to 1961, intentional overbooking was practiced somewhat clan-  
destinely by U.S. airlines and was not acknowledged publicly. Despite  
this fact, Rothstein \[449\] reports that as director of Operations Research  
at American Airlines he, “found much publicly available evidence that  
all the major airlines were deliberately overbooking.” In 1961, the Civil  
Aeronautics Board \(CAB\) reported a no-show rate of 1 out of every  
10 passengers booked among the 12 leading carriers at that time. The  
CAB acknowledged that this situation created real economic problems  
for the airlines. As a result, the CAB implemented a no-show penalty  
of 50% of the ticket price. At the same time, they explicitly required  
airlines to pay a penalty of 50% of the ticket price to passengers who 132 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
were denied boarding. However, the CAB still did not officially sanc-  
tion overbooking practices. The no-show penalty was abandoned in 1963  
largely because airline management felt that the penalties created ill will  
among passengers and might be discouraging air travel in general.  
The CAB conducted another study of overbooking during 1965-66.  
They found that the denied-boarding rate at that time was approxi-  
mately 7.69 per 10,000 passengers boarded \[119\]. Their conclusion was  
issued in a 1967 docket \[119\]\:  
There is a substantial reservation turnover before flight time from cancel-  
lations and no-shows. The airlines are engaging in deliberate or controlled  
overbooking to compensate for it. Through carefully controlled overbooking,  
the airlines can reduce the number of empty seats and at the same time serve  
the public interest by accommodating more passengers.  
The present reservation systems of the carriers greatly benefit the traveling  
public. The Board is not prepared, therefore, to require changes in these  
systems.  
Thus, as of 1965, overbooking was an officially sanctioned practice, pro-  
vided it was “carefully controlled,” a criterion that was never precisely  
defined by the CAB.  
In parallel, the CAB also increased the denied-boarding penalty to  
100% of the coupon. Airlines controlled the percentage of denied board-  
ings, and the CAB carefully monitored the denied-boarding performance  
of each airline. The involuntary denied-boarding rate is still carefully  
monitored in the United States by the Department of Transportation  
\(DOT\) and currently hovers around 0.5 to 1.5 involuntary and 15 to 20  
voluntary denied boardings per 10,000 passengers \(see Table 4.1\).  
Despite this progress in formalizing the practice of planned overbook-  
ing, the traveling public was still largely unaware of its existence. This  
was to change in 1972 when Ralph Nader, the well-known U.S. consumer  
advocate, was denied boarding on an Allegheny Airlines flight. Rather  
than accept the standard compensation, he sued Allegheny, won, and  
was awarded \$25,000 in punitive damages. The judge’s ruling was based  
on the fact that Allegheny did not advise passengers of its practice of  
deliberate overbooking. The case was appealed all the way to the U.S.  
Supreme Court, but the ruling was upheld. As Rothstein \[448\] noted at  
the time\:  
... public policy may very well force the airlines into the position that a reser-  
vation *involves a definite, legal claim on a seat.* And if this happens, most of  
the operations research carried out on this problem will have to be discarded  
and eventually redone. *Overbooking* 133 134 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Rothstein proposed that airlines charge for reservations as a possible  
solution\:  
In other words, the *reservation* itself, as opposed to the physical seat on the  
plane, is to be considered of value ... the reservation itself is a commodity to  
be purchased for an amount of money and possibly to be relinquished for a  
different amount of money.  
In the wake of Mr. Nader’s suit—and after much debate—the CAB  
revised its rules concerning overbooking as follows\:  
Denied-boarding compensation was doubled again to 200% of the  
coupon.  
Airlines were required to seek volunteers first before denying boarding  
to any passenger involuntarily.  
The traveling public was to be notified of the deliberate overbooking  
practices of the airlines.  
A statement warning passengers that their flight may be overbooked  
and informing them of their rights was to be printed on every ticket.  
As a result of this ruling, the DOT requires an overbooking notification  
statement on all U.S. airline tickets \(see Figure 4.1\).  
These basic regulations are still in existence today in the U.S. Since  
deregulation in 1974, airlines have increasingly relied on vouchers and  
payments to attract volunteers to give up their seats on oversold flights.  
As a result, involuntary denied boardings are much less frequent today  
than they were in the days when overbooking was a clandestine practice. *Overbooking* 135  
**4.1.2 Managing Denied-Service Occurrences**  
Managing the compensation and selection of customers in the event  
of oversales can have a significant impact on denied-service costs and  
customer perceptions of overbooking. We next briefly look at the main  
issues involved in managing oversales.  
**4.1.2.1 Compensation for Denied Service**  
While legally mandated compensation often specifies payment of mon-  
etary damage, this is often viewed as inadequate in the eyes of customers.  
A car rental customer who is planning to take a tour of the California  
coast would most likely find the prospect of getting a full refund plus  
50% of the contracted rental rate as poor compensation for a ruined va-  
cation. It is often more effective to offer customers a substitute service  
\(such as an upgrade\) plus ancillary services that may make the short-run  
disruption in their schedule more palatable.  
To illustrate, the same car-rental customer may be much more satis-  
fied with an offer to provide a ride to a competing rental company, a free  
upgrade to a luxury car, plus a voucher for future rentals. Compensation  
that is targeted to substitute for the denied service and perhaps enhance  
it somewhat is frequently less expensive for a firm and more effective in  
the eyes of the customer than pure monetary compensation.  
**4.1.2.2 Selection Criteria**  
Selecting which customers are to be denied service also can have a  
significant impact on both the firm’s direct costs and customer goodwill.  
Prom a legal standpoint, such selection must not be discriminatory. For  
example, for airlines, current DOT regulations state that \[523\]  
Every carrier shall establish priority rules and criteria for determining which  
passengers holding confirmed reserved space shall be denied boarding on an  
oversold flight in the event that an insufficient number of volunteers come  
forward.  
Such rules and criteria shall not make, give, or cause any advantage to any par-  
ticular person or subject any particular person to any unjust or unreasonable  
prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.  
The default option for allocating service to customers is usually to do  
it on a first-come, first-serve \(FCFS\) basis. While a FCFS allocation is  
perceived as fair and encourages customers to arrive on time, there are  
many business situations where this allocation is quite undesirable.  
A good example is hotel overbooking. Using a FCFS allocation for  
a hotel means that the customers who are denied service are those who  
arrive very late in the evening. This creates two difficulties. First, it 136 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
is usually much more disruptive to relocate a customer who arrives late  
at night. These customers are often tired and irritable and simply want  
to go to bed as soon as possible. A customer who arrives in the late  
afternoon, in contrast, may be willing to sightsee around the town for  
several hours or go out for a meal while alternative accommodations are  
secured and their baggage is transported. Second, late-arriving hotel  
customers are typically business travelers who pay the highest rates,  
travel often, and therefore represent the most profitable segment for  
most hotels. In terms of the lifetime value, these customers are the most  
costly to lose.  
Hotels therefore do not always allocate rooms on a FCFS basis.  
Rather, they monitor arrival rates and occupancy throughout the day  
to anticipate a potential oversold condition. If at some point managers  
expect an oversale, they may find alternative arrangements for early-  
arriving customers to avoid denying service to customers due to check  
in very late.  
In other service situations, it is sometimes possible to select among  
a pool of customers when allocating service. For example, in airline  
boarding, customers usually gather to the gate before departure. This  
gives gate agents a chance to see which passengers have arrived for the  
flight and to selectively target specific passengers for denied-boarding  
offers. Indeed, we are aware of one Australian airline that trains its gate  
agents to solicit young, student travelers \(“backpackers”\) as volunteers.  
The airline found that customers in this segment are eager to receive  
a nice hotel room and a good meal in exchange for taking a flight the  
following day.  
**4.1.2.3 Oversale Auctions**  
An alternative method of managing oversales is to conduct an auc-  
tion to attract volunteers to give up their reservations in exchange for  
monetary or other compensation. While this practice is now widespread  
in airlines and familiar to most travelers, the idea was not well received  
initially.  
In 1968, economist Julian Simon proposed what he called “an almost  
practical solution to airline overbooking, ” in which airlines would con-  
duct a sealed-bid “reverse auction” to find passengers willing to accept  
monetary compensation for being bumped. Simon predicted \(rightly so,  
as initial responses to his letters to airline executives later indicated\)  
that the airlines would object to the scheme  
because such an auction does not seem decorous; it smacks of the pushcart  
rather than the one-price store; it is “embarrassing” and “crass,” i.e., frankly  
commercial, like ‘being in trade’ in Victorian England \(\[472\]\). *Overbooking* 137  
Simon cites this tongue-in-cheek reaction from airline executive Blaine  
Cooke\:  
I greatly fear that your Overbooking Auction Plan suffers from a flawed  
premise and a fatal defect. The flawed premise is that you assume that air-  
line management and regulation is a rational exercise. It is not. It is more  
accurately described as an exercise in applied insanity. The effect is your plan  
offers a market-sensitive and sensible solution to a real problem but a solution  
not conceived by an airline. Accordingly, the idea must be disallowed since it  
is well established in airline marketing that only ideas which originate within  
the airline industry are permissible.  
Simon wrote many letters to executives, regulators, policy makers,  
and customer groups arguing for his “oversale-auction” idea. Despite  
these efforts, he failed to get even one airline to experiment with it  
on even a single flight. Even prominent fellow economists questioned  
the practicality of the idea. Simon \[474\] quotes a letter from Milton  
Friedman\:  
If the plan is as good as you and I think it is, I am utterly baffled by the  
unwillingness of one or more of the airlines to experiment with it. I conclude  
that we must be overlooking something. I realize that you have tested this  
quite exhaustively, and I have no reason to question your results; yet I find  
it even harder to believe that opportunities for large increments of profit are  
being rejected for wholly irrational reasons.  
The scheme continued to flounder until 1977 when Alfred Kahn, an  
economist, was appointed to head the CAB. Simon wrote to Kahn about  
his proposal and Kahn liked and largely adopted it under the heading of  
a “volunteer” denied-boarding plan, as mentioned above. At the same  
time, Kahn increased penalties for involuntary denied boardings.  
Simon \[474\] quotes an American Airlines internal newsletter from  
April 27, 1979\:  
The happiest result of the volunteer plan is that airlines now have a fair and  
efficient way to avoid denying seats to people who for business or personal  
reasons have a pressing need to make their flights as planned. VP, Passenger  
Services, Robert H. Phillips points out that the voluntary program has twin  
virtues\: “It enables us to reduce costs while maintaining customer goodwill  
and thereby protecting future revenue”.  
Given the success of this volunteer denied-boarding plan, it appears that  
airline management has indeed inched closer to the notion of a “rational  
exercise.”  
**4.1.3 Lessons Beyond the Airline Industry**  
There are several broader lessons to be learned from this history of  
airline overbooking. One is that it takes time for customers to get 138 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
used to and accept overbooking practices, and providers in turn have  
to learn how to develop strategies and operational practices that make  
overbooking as painless as possible for customers. In the airline indus-  
try, this process took decades to develop. A second lesson is that some  
seemingly fanciful techniques—in particular the oversale auction—can  
in fact prove to be surprisingly popular and effective in practice, which  
serves as a caution for those who are quick to criticize such innovations.  
Finally, while there is no denying that overbooking is a well-developed  
and refined practice in the airline and hotel industries, it nevertheless re-  
mains a primary source of dissatisfaction for customers. Overbooking is  
frequently cited in customer complaints, both to individual firms and to  
government regulators. So even at its best, overbooking is a somewhat  
awkward compromise between economic efficiency and service quality.  
**4.2 Static Overbooking Models**  
We next look at the methodology for making overbooking decisions.  
The simplest and most widely used methodology is based on *static over-*  
*booking models.* In static models, the dynamics of customer cancellations  
and new reservation requests over time are ignored. Rather, the models  
simply determine the maximum number of reservations to hold at the  
current time given estimates of cancellation rates from the current time  
until the day of service. This maximum number of reservations, or *over-*  
*booking limit,* is then recomputed periodically prior to service to reflect  
changing state and cancellation probabilities over time. While more so-  
phisticated dynamic overbooking models have been developed and are  
discussed in Section 4.3, the simplicity, flexibility, and robustness of the  
simpler static models have made them more popular in practice.  
Two types of events impact the overbooking decision—*cancellations*  
and *no-shows*—with the difference simply related to the timing of the  
events. \(Again, a cancellation is a reservation that is withdrawn by a  
customer strictly prior to the time of service; a no-show is someone who  
does not cancel and does not show up at the time of service.\) While  
both result in a situation where a reservation does not “survive” to the  
time of service, with a cancellation, the firm has an opportunity to possi-  
bly replace the cancelled reservation; in contrast, there is little recourse  
available to compensate for a no-show. Under a static model, the dis-  
tinction between the two is unnecessary, since a static model assumes a  
static overbooking limit is set without recourse to adjust it. Thus, all  
that matters is the probability that a reservation survives to the time  
of service \(the *show demand,* as it is called\). In dynamic overbooking  
models, however, the distinction between no-shows and cancellations is  
important. *Overbooking* 139  
In airline and hotel practice, static models are used to compute over-  
booking limits—also called *virtual capacities* or *overbooking authoriza-*  
*tion levels* in the airline industry—which are, in turn, used as inputs to  
capacity-allocation models. These static overbooking models are typi-  
cally re-solved periodically to account for changes in the cancellation and  
no-show probabilities over time, resulting in overbooking limits that vary  
\(typically decline\) over time. The current overbooking limit gives the  
maximum number of reservations one will accept at any time.  
The situation is illustrated in Figure 4.2. The top, wide line is the  
overbooking limit over time. Solving a static model gives one point on  
this curve. Overbooking limits are set high initially because the proba-  
bility of a reservation cancelling prior to the time of service or no-showing  
is usually higher the longer the time till service. As the time of service  
\(*T*\) approaches, the overbooking limits fall. At the same time, reserva-  
tions are being accumulated in the system over time. The dark line in  
Figure 4.2 shows that with overbooking in place, the reservations in the  
system can exceed the capacity *C,* and we don’t stop accepting reserva-  
tions until the overbooking limit is reached. At that point reservations  
are rejected. The resulting show demand \(demand that shows up finally\)  
at time *T* is ideally close to the capacity *C.* The lower line shows the  
same trajectory of reservations without overbooking. In this case, the  
reservations in the system are truncated at the capacity *C* early on in  
the booking process. As a result, once reservations start to cancel and  
no-show, the show demand is significantly less than capacity.  
**4.2.1 The Binomial Model**  
The simplest static model is based on a *binomial model* of cancellations  
in which no-shows are lumped together with cancellations \(that is, a no-  
show is treated simply as a cancellation that occurs at the day of service\).  
The following assumptions are made\:  
Customers cancel independently of one another.  
Each customer has the same probability of cancelling.  
The cancellation probability is Markovian; it depends only on the  
time remaining to service and is independent of the age of the reser-  
vation.  
Let denote the time remaining until service, *C* denote the physi-  
cal capacity, denote the number of reservations on hand, and the  
probability that a reservation currently on hand shows up at the time of  
service is the probability that customers cancel prior to the time 140 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
of service\). Note that is really a function of the time remaining, since  
in general the more time remaining the more likely it is that customers  
cancel before the time of service. However, to keep the notation simple  
we suppress the dependence of on Also, in practice estimates of  
may be based on the ratio of show demand to reservations on hand \(the  
net bookings\) rather than on individual customer cancellation rates; this  
approach is discussed further in Section 4.3.2.  
Under the assumptions stated above, the number of customers who  
show up at the time of service given there are reservations on hand,  
denoted \(the *show demand*\)*,* is binomially distributed with p.m.f.\:  
and with c.d.f.\:  
with mean and variance It is  
convenient to work with the complement of the distribution denoted *Overbooking* 141  
by which is defined by  
Several airline industry studies have validated this binomial model of  
cancellations. For example, in one of the earliest investigations of over-  
booking, Thompson \[508\] considers data from 59 flights from Auckland  
to Sydney operated by Tasman Empire Airways. He eliminated groups  
of six or more since they exhibited much lower cancellation rates and al-  
though rare \(11 total booking on the 59 flights\), can significantly distort  
the cancellation rate on the flights involved. Parties of six or fewer con-  
stituted 99.6% of all bookings; 81% of the remaining were singles; 15%  
were paired and 4% were parties of three to six. \(See Table 4.4.\) While  
the results showed that group-cancellation behavior does invalidate the  
binomial model for certain cabins on certain flights, overall he concluded  
that the binomial model adequately fits the data. \(Group-cancellation  
effects are discussed further in Section 4.2.4.\)  
**4.2.1.1 Overbooking Based on Service-Level Criteria**  
One measure of service is the probability of oversale at the time of  
service, which we call the *Type 1 service level.* We assume the firm uses  
an *overbooking-limit policy* to control the number of reservations that  
are accepted. The overbooking limit is denoted In other words, we  
assume the firm continues to accept reservations as long as the number  
of reservations on hand is less than *x* and stops accepting reservations  
once 3  
The Type 1 service level is denoted and is given by  
That is, if we assume that the number of reservations on hand reaches  
our overbooking limit then will be the probability that we have  
to deny service to one or more customers. Hence, setting an overbooking  
limit of guarantees that the probability of oversale will not exceed  
An arguably more natural measure of service is the long-run fraction  
of customers who are denied service, which we call the *Type 2 service*  
3Whether such a threshold policy is in any sense optimal for the dynamic decision-making  
problem is addressed in Section 4.3. Here we simply assume such an overbooking policy is  
used. 142 *level* denoted by *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
This fraction is given by4  
Setting an overbooking limit of ensures that, at most, a fraction  
of customer will be denied service. Through some algebraic simplifica-  
tion, one can show that  
which is a more convenient formula for computations.  
Table 4.2 shows the Type 1 and Type 2 service levels for an example  
with *C =* 150, and varying overbooking limit In practice,  
we first specify a service level and then numerically search for the largest  
booking level satisfying the specified service level. The resulting  
is the overbooking limit. The quantity \(the excess over capacity\)  
is referred to as the *overbooking pad.*  
**Example 4.1** Suppose we want no more than 0.1% of customers to be denied service  
and our capacity is *C* = 150 and From Table 4.2, we should accept at most  
168 reservations since this is the largest value for which less than  
.001, \(though 169 has a service level only slightly over the standard and might be a  
candidate as well\). Reservations would then be accepted as long as the number of  
bookings on hand is less than 168. The overbooking pad would be 168 – 150 = 18.  
Note that if we do not receive at least requests for reservations,  
the service levels will in fact be higher than and In other  
words, these measures predict the service level for instances in which  
demand exceeds but the service level will be higher if demand is  
strictly less than So effectively, we are considering a worst-case  
service level \(demand exceeding the overbooking limit\) rather than an  
average-case service level.  
4As a technical aside, note that one may be tempted to define the Type 2 service level as  
the average fraction denied service, rather than by \(4.3\). This is wrong, however, because it  
does not account for the varying number of customers served. For example, if *C =* 100, then  
it would count a day in which and a day in which equally as two days  
with denied service fractions of zero, when in reality the second day represents 100 times as  
many customers. The renewal-reward theorem leading to \(4.3\) provides the correct measure  
of the long-run fraction of customers who are denied service. *Overbooking* 143  
The average service level is, however, easy to calculate for a given dis-  
tribution of demand. To illustrate, consider the Type 2 service level. Let  
the random variable *D* denote the demand \(unrestricted by capacity\).  
Then by the renewal-reward theorem, the average Type 2 service for an  
overbooking level denoted is given by  
One then searches for the largest value of service level that is within a given limit.  
that provides an average 144 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The problem with using average service levels is that customers who  
make reservations only on congested days will experience service levels  
closer to than to This is a form of the *inspection paradox*  
of probability theory, in which customers who book only on busy days  
experience worse-than-average service. Thus, a service standard based  
on is often justified since it guarantees that all customers, regard-  
less of their patterns of usage, will experience at least the target service  
standard.  
**4.2.1.2 Overbooking Based on Economic Criteria**  
An alternative to setting overbooking limits based on service levels is  
to use an economic criterion. This approach requires an estimate of the  
revenue loss from not accepting additional reservations and an estimate  
of the cost of denied service. We first develop the details of the economic  
model and then discuss some of the issues involved in estimating the  
revenue loss and cost inputs.  
**Model and Basic Results** Suppose customers show up on the day of  
service \(the show demand\), and let denote the denied-service cost.  
We shall assume is an increasing convex function of For example,  
a common assumption in practice is that each denied-service costs the  
firm a constant marginal amount in which case  
An arguably more realistic assumption is to assume strictly increasing  
marginal costs, reflecting the need to offer higher levels of compensation  
\(or incur higher goodwill costs\) as each additional customer is denied  
service.  
Let denote the marginal revenue generated by accepting an addi-  
tional reservation. One could also allow this marginal revenue to vary,  
but it is a common simplification in practice to consider it fixed. \(We  
discuss this issue further below.\) Then the total expected profit from  
having reservations on hand is given by  
where, as before, the random variable denotes the number of cus-  
tomers who show up on the day of service out of reservations. One can  
show for the binomial model that if is convex, then V\(·\) is concave, 5  
in which case, since is concave, it follows that it is optimal to accept  
the reservation as long as the marginal profit  
5This follows from stochastic convexity arguments; see Appendix B for a discussion. *Overbooking* 145  
is positive and to continue accepting reservations until this marginal  
profit turns negative. Thus, the optimal booking limit is the largest  
value of satisfying  
For the binomial model with constant marginal costs and parameter  
this condition reduces to  
This expression can be argued intuitively by noting that when we accept  
the reservation, we incur a marginal denied-boarding penalty of if  
and only if \(1\) the current reservations on hand consume all the capacity  
and \(2\) the customer shows up. The left-hand side  
of \(4.6\) is simply the marginal penalty multiplied by the probability of  
this event or equivalently the expected marginal cost. Then is the  
largest value of for which the expected marginal cost is less than the  
marginal revenue.  
We can express \(4.6\) as  
Note that this is equivalent to setting a fixed Type 1 service level for  
a capacity of *C –* 1. For large capacities *C,* so  
using economic criteria with constant marginal costs corresponds ap-  
proximately to specifying a particular Type 1 service level. This fact  
provides one justification for using Type 1 service levels.  
To illustrate \(4.7\), consider the following example\:  
**Example 4.2** Suppose *C =* 150, the overbooking cost is and  
the marginal revenue is Then From Table 4.2 and \(4.7\), we  
see that the optimal overbooking limit is then since this is the largest value  
of for which The overbooking pad is then 172 – 150 = 22.  
**Cost and Revenue Parameters** While overbooking based on eco-  
nomic criteria is conceptually appealing, it requires good estimates of  
the marginal revenues and costs. The marginal revenue is usually the  
easier of the two to determine. If there is only one class, the marginal  
revenue is simply the common price but with multiple classes determin-  
ing the marginal revenue is more complex. A heuristic approach is to  
use the weighted-average revenue. However, as shown in Chapter 2, the  
marginal revenue produced by an additional unit of capacity is not, in  
general, equal to the weighted-average revenue. Moreover, the marginal 146 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
revenue is typically decreasing in the available capacity, so the linear  
marginal revenue assumption is violated. Both these factors complicate  
the estimation of marginal revenue in practice.  
Estimating the denied-boarding cost involves other complications.  
Some elements of this cost are clear\: in particular, any refund of the  
purchase price or monetary compensation or both is easy to quantify in  
most cases. But if auctions are used to determine compensation, then  
this compensation must be estimated. Vouchers for free service in the  
future require a more careful accounting of the actual cost of providing  
the service, as this is often less than the face value of the voucher.  
Most difficult of all to quantify is the goodwill loss of upsetting a  
customer. In principle, this can be taken to be equal to the discounted  
potential revenue stream of future purchases from the customer \(the so-  
called lifetime value of the customer\). This is rather difficult quantify,  
but it is usually worth an attempt to make this calculation to at least  
get the correct order of magnitude of goodwill losses.  
One useful idea to get around these estimation problems is to com-  
pute imputed costs based on subjective service-level criteria rather than  
specifying a denied-service cost a priori. To obtain an imputed cost  
from a given overbooking limit set according to Type 2 service levels,  
one simply rearranges \(4.7\) to obtain  
The following example illustrates the use of this formula\:  
**Example 4.3** We saw above that if the service standard is 0.1% we  
should accept at most reservations. Since if the  
marginal revenue is this implies an imputed cost of denied service of  
The figure looks rather large relative to the \$100 revenue, so one might question if a  
0.1% Type 2 service level is economically justified.  
Often, these imputed cost numbers provide useful feedback, since they  
translate service levels, which are tangible and somewhat easier to spec-  
ify, into economic penalties, which most people find harder to quantify.  
The economic costs, in turn, serve as a useful “sanity check” on the  
reasonableness of a given service level by giving the magnitude of the  
implied costs. *Overbooking* 147  
**4.2.2 Static-Model Approximations**  
While the binomial model is quite simple, it is often desirable to have  
simpler, closed-form expressions for the overbooking limits. We next  
look briefly at such approximations.  
# 4.2.2.1 Deterministic Approximation  
The *deterministic approximation* simply sets the overbooking limit so  
that the average show demand is exactly equal to the capacity; namely,  
As simplistic as this approximation is, we have seen several RM imple-  
mentations that use it. The approximation is not completely unjustified,  
however, as illustrated by the following example\:  
**Example 4.4** Consider our continuing example where *C =* 150 and The  
deterministic approximation yields an overbooking limit of From  
Table 4.2, one can see that both service measures and begin to change  
rapidly in the range of to which is approximately centered around  
the deterministic level 176. So lacking detailed service standards or cost information,  
a value around the deterministic level is not an unreasonable heuristic to use.  
**4.2.2.2 Normal Approximation**  
In practical implementations, it is common to use a continuous ap-  
proximation to the binomial model to simplify computations. One pop-  
ular choice is the *normal approximation,* in which the distribution  
is replaced by the normal distribution with mean and variance  
chosen to match the binomial, viz.,  
The Type 1 service level is then approximated by  
where  
and is the c.d.f. of the standard normal distribution. 148 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The Type 2 service level is then approximated by6  
Table 4.2 shows the estimates produced by the normal approximation  
for our example with *C =* 150 and As can be seen, they are  
reasonably close to the values of the binomial model.  
The economic overbooking limit \(4.7\) for the constant marginal-cost  
function \(4.4\) is approximated by choosing to satisfy  
**4.2.2.3 Gram-Charlier Series Approximation**  
The *Gram-Charlier series* improves on the normal approximation of  
the binomial distribution by allowing for skewness of the distribution.  
The standardized density function for this distribution is  
where  
is the squared coefficient of skewness. If this reduces to the  
standard normal distribution. For the binomial model, the coefficient of  
skewness is given by  
Letting denote the standardized booking level as before,  
the fraction of overbooked passengers is approximated by  
where, as above, distribution, respectively.  
and are the standard normal density and  
6This follows from the fact that if *Z is* a normal random variable with mean  
then  
and variance  
where *Overbooking* 149  
Table 4.3 shows some numerical comparisons of the normal and Gram-  
Charlier approximations of the binomial model. In general, the normal  
approximation tends to overestimate the fraction of denied boardings.  
The Gram-Charlier approximation also overestimates, but less so.  
**4.2.3 Customer Class Mix**  
One important practical issue that arises in overbooking is that differ-  
ent classes may have quite different cancellation rates. For example, in  
the airline case, full-coach customers often have no cancellation penalty,  
while discount-class customers typically incur a significant fee for can-  
celling a reservation. As a result, the two classes exhibit very different  
rates of cancellation. Thus, the cancellation rate observed in a collection  
of reservations may be highly dependent on the mix of classes.  
Exact methods to handle this class-mix problem involve keeping track  
of the inventory of each class as a separate state variable and then mak-  
ing overbooking decisions based on this complete vector of state vari-  
ables. Such an approach is described in detail for a multiclass model in  
Section 4.5 below.  
The difficulty with such exact approaches, however, is that they result  
in significantly more complicated overbooking models and methodology.  
As a result, most often in practice, one of several heuristic approaches  
is used to account for customer class mix.  
The most common practice is to use a cancellation probability that  
is empirically estimated for each resource separately. In this way, one 150 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
can capture at least the historical mix of customer segments booked on  
each resource. Another approach is to estimate the cancellation proba-  
bility for each class and then use estimates of the class mix on each re-  
source to construct a weighted average cancellation probability for each  
resource. Compared with straight estimation of the resource-level can-  
cellation rate, this method has the advantage of reducing the variance  
in the estimates and allows for a more rapid adjustment of cancellation  
rates as the class mix changes over time.  
**4.2.4 Group Cancellations**  
The presence of groups also has an important effect on cancellation  
models in practice. If a group decides to cancel, then all reservations are  
cancelled simultaneously. The resulting positive correlation in cancel-  
lations increases the variance of the show demand. When dealing with  
large numbers of reservations, it is often possible to ignore the effect of  
groups, but with small numbers of reservations, group effects can result  
in significant deviations from the binomial model.  
To gain some sense of the presence of groups in RM bookings, Ta-  
ble 4.4 provides an empirical distribution of group sizes over approxi-  
mately half a million airline reservations. About half of the reservations  
are individual reservations, while the other half are from groups of two  
or more.  
One simple technique used in practice to adjust for group size is to  
simply inflate the variance of the show demand by a factor that accounts *Overbooking* 151  
for group size. For example‚ if we are using the normal approximation  
to the binomial model as described in Section 4.2.2.2‚ then the estimate  
of the mean show demand‚ is unchanged but the variance estimate‚  
is modified as follows\:  
where is a factor to account for group cancellations—for example‚ the  
average group size.7  
A more refined technique for adjusting for groups is based on moment-  
generating functions. Recall that the moment-generating function of a  
random variable *Z* is We can then find the moments of  
*Z* using the fact that  
Let of size denote the overbooking limit and We will assume that  
denote the number of groups  
where is the historical fraction of reservations that are from groups  
of size As an approximation‚ we allow to be nonintegral. Let  
denote the probability that a group of size survives to the time of  
service \(called the *utilization ratio* in the airline industry\). Then the  
moment-generating function for the number of survivals from  
total reservations‚ is  
from which one can find the first three central moments of show demand‚  
7 Setting equal to the average group size is obtained by assuming that all reservations are  
in groups of exactly size in which case with reservations on hand‚ there are groups  
of size so the variance of the show demand is 152 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
These three moments can then be used in the Gram-Charlier series  
approximation \(4.10\); alternatively‚ the first two moments can be used  
in the normal approximation \(4.8\).  
**4.3 Dynamic Overbooking Models**  
The static models do not explicitly account for the dynamics of ar-  
rivals‚ cancellations‚ and decision making over time. Here we look at  
models of overbooking that account for such intertemporal effects. We  
first look at an exact *dynamic overbooking model* and then discuss heuris-  
tic approaches.  
**4.3.1 Exact Approaches**  
The model presented here is a simplification of one due to  
Chatwin \[109\]. The state variables are time‚ and the  
number of reservations on hand‚ Let the value function be denoted  
The terminal costs are  
where *C* is the fixed capacity and is a convex cost function penalizing  
denied service. The revenue received from accepting a new reservation  
in period is denoted If a reservation is cancelled in period  
the firm pays a refund of \(Note that in this model the  
refund depends only on the time the reservation is cancelled and not  
on the time-period in which the reservation was made; this \(somewhat  
unrealistic\) assumption is necessary to simplify the state space.\)  
Let denote the number of surviving reservations at the end of  
period so that given reservations are on hand at the end of period  
is the random number surviving to the start of period We  
assume that has a binomial distribution with survival probability  
Let denote the random number of new reservation requests in  
period \(the demand in period is assumed independent across  
time and independent of  
The order of events in a period is as follows\: \(1\) there are reser-  
vations on hand, and new reservation requests arrive; \(2\) booking  
decisions are made for the new reservation requests, raising the booking  
level to where then \(3\) cancellations are observed at  
the end of the period. The dynamic programming recursion is then *Overbooking* 153  
We then have the following result\:  
PROPOSITION 4.1 *If the denied-service cost is convex, then an*  
*overbooking-limit policy is optimal. That is, in each period there exists*  
*a critical value such that it is optimal to continue accepting new*  
*reservations until the total number of reservations on hand reaches*  
This result provides some theoretical support for the use of booking limit  
policies. The following proposition in turn provides sufficient conditions  
for optimal booking limits to be monotone in time\:  
PROPOSITION 4.2 *Suppose the denied-service cost is convex and the*  
*survival probabilities the revenues and the refunds satisfy*  
*Then the optimal overbooking limit \(or greatest optimal booking*  
*limits if more than one optimal limit exists\) decline with time. That is,*  
This declining-booking-limit situation corresponds to the overbooking  
curve shown in Figure 4.2. Note that this condition is satisfied whenever  
the revenues are decreasing over time and refunds paid  
in period do not exceed the price in period 8  
Another important monotonicity result concerns how overbooking  
limits are affected by the magnitude of future demand. In particular,  
let be a parameter of the distribution of arrivals so that  
Then we have the following  
PROPOSITION 4.3 *Suppose the denied-service cost is convex and*  
*is stochastically increasing in Then the optimal booking lim-*  
*its \(or greatest optimal booking limits if more than one optimal*  
*limit exists\) are nonincreasing in*  
8To gain some intuition for this condition‚ note it can be written as  
Roughly‚ this can be interpreted as follows. Suppose we are willing to accept a booking in  
period in state Then must exceed the opportunity cost of an additional  
reservation in state in period Now consider state in period If we accept an  
additional booking‚ we collect revenue If this reservation cancels at the end of period  
we pay a refund this occurs with probability and the state \(after the cancellation\)  
returns to If the reservation survives to period it creates an opportunity cost analogous  
to accepting a request in period which by the argument above is at most \(since  
we accept a request in state in period this occurs with probability So if the  
revenue exceeds the “average cost” of these outcomes‚ then we should be willing accept  
an arrival in period in state as well. Hence‚ the booking limit in period is at least as  
large as that in period 154 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
This result says that as demand to come increases \(stochastically\)‚  
it is better to be less aggressive in overbooking at any given point in  
time. The intuition is that if we have more opportunities to book seats  
in the future‚ we do not need to take as great an overbooking risk in  
the current period. The result also highlights the fact that the optimal  
overbooking limits in general do depend on future demand‚ which is  
something that the static overbooking models ignore. In particular‚ note  
that the calculation of costs in the static overbooking model effectively  
assumes there are no opportunities to replace cancelled reservations with  
new reservations.9 Since the degenerate case of no future demand is  
always stochastically smaller than any nontrivial distribution of future  
demand‚ Proposition 4.3 implies that static overbooking models will  
produce overbooking limits that are higher than optimal.  
**4.3.2 Heuristic Approaches Based on Net**  
# Bookings  
While dynamic overbooking models provide some nice insights‚ they  
are not used very often in practice. This is due partly to their added  
complexity and partly because to their similarity to the more general  
combined capacity control and overbooking models that we look at in  
Section 4.4 below.  
In RM practice‚ the dynamics of cancellations and new reservations  
and arrivals are more commonly accounted for by using relative changes  
in bookings on hand \(so-called *net bookings*\) rather than customer-level  
cancellation probabilities as a basis for estimating cancellation rates in  
a static overbooking model. The idea of net bookings can be best illus-  
trated by going back to Figure 4.2‚ which shows a sample of the level of  
booking on hand over time. The change in bookings on hand from one  
time-period to the next depends on both the number of cancellations and  
the number of new reservations that are accepted. Looking at changes  
in the bookings on hand gives us a measure of the net bookings. Quite  
often in practice‚ net-bookings data is in fact the only data available for  
use in estimating overbooking parameters.  
Since net bookings reflect both cancellations and new reservations‚  
they can be used to provide an alternative estimate of the cancellation  
9More precisely‚ the assumption in the static model is that the show demand when the  
booking limit is reached is a binomial random variable representing the number of  
surviving reservations out of total reservations. Hence‚ show demand consists *only* of those  
reservations that survive from the current time until the time of service. If new reservations  
are accepted to replace cancelled reservations‚ then the show demand will be larger than  
which is what the dynamic model accounts for. *Overbooking* 155  
rate‚ which one can interpret as an approximation to an exact dynamic  
model. More precisely‚ one can estimate the survival “rate” as the  
average ratio of show demand to the number of bookings on hand in time  
\(or to the number of peak bookings on hand if is before the peak;  
see Figure 4.2.\). This net-bookings approach to estimating cancellation  
rates is again quite prevalent in RM practice and seems to lead to better  
approximations of real world service levels and costs.  
**4.4 Combined Capacity-Control and Overbooking**  
# Models  
Thus far‚ we have analyzed the overbooking problem in isolation with-  
out considering the interaction of overbooking decisions with capacity  
controls. We next look at both exact and approximate methods to  
model cancellations and no-shows together with the class allocations  
of quantity-based RM.  
Incorporating no-shows or cancellations in either the static or dy-  
namic single-resource model is not too difficult theoretically‚ provided  
one makes the following \(not entirely satisfying‚ but analytically useful\)  
set of assumptions\:  
ASSUMPTION 4.1  
*\(i\) The cancellation and no-show probabilities are the same for all cus-*  
*tomers.*  
*\(ii\) Cancellations and no-shows are mutually independent across cus-*  
*tomers.*  
*\(iii\) Cancellations and no-shows in any period are independent of the*  
*time the reservations on hand were accepted.*  
*\(iv\) The refunds and denied-service costs are the same for all customers.*  
The assumptions imply that the number of no-shows and the costs in-  
curred are only a function of the total number of reservations on hand.  
As a result‚ we need only to retain a single state variable‚ and the re-  
sulting dynamic programs are only slightly more complex than those  
presented in Chapter 2.  
The most restrictive of these assumptions in practice are \(i\) and \(iv\)\:  
cancellation options and penalties are often linked directly to a class‚ so  
cancellation and no-show rates and costs can vary significantly from one  
class to the next. Ideally‚ these differences should be accounted for when  
making allocation decisions. However‚ this significantly complicates the  
problem‚ as we show below. As already mentioned‚ Assumption 4.1\(ii\) 156 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
is often unrealistic because reservations from people in groups typically  
cancel at the same time. Assumption 4.1\(iii\) is less of a problem in  
practice and has some empirical support \[508\].  
In most implementations‚ the overbooking problem is separated from  
the capacity-allocation problem. Often‚ an approximate static overbook-  
ing model can be solved that is able to relax \(at least heuristically\) some  
or all parts of Assumption 4.1. However‚ given Assumption 4.1‚ the over-  
booking and capacity-allocation problems can be combined exactly‚ as  
we show next.  
**4.4.1 Exact Methods for No-Shows Under**  
# Assumption 4.1  
We first consider only no-shows and assume that there are no cancel-  
lations prior to the time of service. Let denote the probability that a  
customer with a reservation shows up for service is the no-show  
probability\). Assumption 4.1\(i\) says this probability is assumed to be  
the same for all customers‚ and Assumption 4.1 \(iii\) that it is independent  
of when the reservation was made.  
Let if customer shows up for service and otherwise.  
Given there are reservations on hand just prior to the time of service‚  
the number of customers who show up at time zero \(the show demand\)‚  
denoted is then  
and by Assumption 4.1\(iii\) is a binomial random variable‚  
with  
By Assumption 4.1\(iv\), the total cost of denied service is only a func-  
tion of the show demand Let denote the overbooking cost given  
We will require that be increasing and convex with Con-  
vexity in cost is quite natural since the marginal cost of denying service  
to customers tends to increase with the number denied. For example,  
we could have a simple linear cost per denied customer in which case  
where, as before, *C* is the capacity.  
Given this no-show model, the expected cost of service given  
that there are reservations on hand at the time of service, is given by  
Stochastic convexity arguments \(see Appendix B\) show that is  
concave in if is convex. The above expression then replaces the *Overbooking* 157  
boundary conditions of the dynamic program for the static and dynamic  
models.  
**4.4.1.1 Static Model**  
Consider the static model of Section 2.2‚ where the classes are ordered  
by prices and we assumed classes arrive in the order  
of lowest to highest revenue. Classes and stages are indexed by The  
state variable is now defined to be the number of reservations on hand  
rather than the remaining capacity as in Section 2.2.  
The Bellman equation \(2.3\) for the static model is then modified to  
account for no-shows as follows  
with boundary conditions \(4.12\) and for all where  
is now interpreted as the expected *net benefit* \(expected revenue minus  
the expected terminal cost\) of operating the system from stage onward  
given that there are reservations on hand.10  
Given the concavity of the same argument as in Proposition 2.1  
from Chapter 2 shows that the value function in \(4.13\) is concave  
in for all and Since there is no hard capacity constraint in this  
case‚ it is more meaningful to express the optimal policy in terms of  
booking limits. The optimal nested booking limits are given by  
where now has the interpretation as  
the marginal cost of holding another reservation in stage and is  
increasing in It is then optimal to accept class if and only if the  
number of reservations on hand is strictly less than  
**4.4.1.2 Dynamic Model**  
Similarly‚ the optimality equations \(2.17\) for the dynamic model of  
Section 2.5 are modified to account for no-shows as follows\:  
10Note that in this case is a decreasing function of since the more reservations we  
have on hand now‚ the fewer the future opportunities to collect revenue or the higher the  
expected future terminal costs. 158 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where‚ recall‚ is the random revenue in period equal to with  
probability The boundary conditions are  
and only if  
for all It is optimal to accept an arrival of class if and  
where again is interpreted as the  
marginal cost of accepting another reservation.  
Note that under this model‚ one can always justify accepting a suf-  
ficiently high revenue provided the marginal cost is finite.  
This makes perfect economic sense since we should in principle be will-  
ing to accept an almost certain denied-service cost if some customer is  
willing to pay enough to compensate us for this cost. For example‚ if  
the overbooking cost is linear of the form then the  
marginal cost is never more than so any request with revenue greater  
than will always be accepted.  
This property of not having an explicit limit on the number of reserva-  
tions \(rather‚ just an economic limit\) has been called *infinite overbooking*  
by some in the airline industry‚ since it is in sharp contrast to the usual  
practice of setting a hard overbooking limit. Also‚ it highlights the po-  
tential suboptimality of using fixed overbooking limits.  
**4.4.2 Class-Dependent No-Show Refunds**  
If one relaxes one or more parts of Assumption 4.1‚ then the problem  
becomes considerably more difficult. The difficulty stems from the fact  
that if no-show rates or costs depend on customer class or the time of  
purchase or both‚ then one must retain a state variable for each class  
or each time-period or both. The resulting increase in dimensionality of  
the dynamic program makes it essentially intractable. However‚ it turns  
out that class-dependent refunds can be readily incorporated through  
an appropriate change of variable.  
Suppose customers of class who no-show in period zero are given a  
refund that is strictly less than the revenue we receive from them‚  
However‚ all other assumptions in Assumption 4.1 hold. A  
naive formulation of this class-dependent refund feature would require  
keeping track of each class separately so that refunds can be properly  
awarded at the time of service. However‚ whether a given customer no-  
shows is completely independent of all other decisions and events in the  
system. Thus‚ one can in fact charge for the expected refund at the time  
the reservation is accepted rather than at the time of service‚ with no *Overbooking* 159  
resulting difference in total expected revenues and costs. \(This is merely  
a bookkeeping change.\)  
More precisely‚ if we accept a reservation from a customer of class  
it will yield a reduced revenue of  
independent of everything else in the system. Therefore‚ we simply  
use in place of in either \(4.13\) or \(4.14\) to modify the problem  
formulation. Note‚ however‚ that depending on the refund‚ the ordering  
of may be different from the ordering of For example‚ customers  
in the high revenue class who receive a full refund if they no-show may  
yield a lower net revenue than customers of a lower class who get  
no refund if they no-show. Since the nested protection levels are now  
based on the net revenue rather than the gross revenue the optimal  
policy may reject the high gross-revenue customer in favor of the high  
net-revenue one.  
**4.4.3 Exact Methods for Cancellations Under**  
# Assumption 4.1  
Cancellations complicate the dynamic program a little more than no-  
shows‚ but they are still quite manageable under Assumption 4.1. Again‚  
we look at the static and dynamic models in turn.  
**4.4.3.1 Static Model**  
Let denote the probability that a reservation in the system at the  
start of stage survives to stage \(recall that in the single-resource  
static model of Section 2.2 stages go from *N* to 0\). So is the  
probability that a reservation cancels in stage By Assumption 4.1 \(i\)‚  
\(ii\)‚ and \(iii\)‚ these probabilities are the same and independent for all  
customers as well as the age of their reservations. Let denote the  
number of reservations that survive stage given that there are reser-  
vations on hand in stage are the number of cancellations  
in stage  
The Bellman equation \(2.3\) for the static model is then modified to  
account for cancellations as follows  
with boundary conditions \(4.12\)‚ where 160 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
is the expected value function after cancellations in stage Again‚  
stochastic convexity arguments show that if is concave in  
then is concave in and hence a modification of the argument  
in Proposition 2.1 shows that the value function defined by \(4.16\)  
is concave in  
Nested booking limits are optimal with the optimal booking limits  
given by  
where we accept class is strictly less than  
if and only if the number of reservations on hand  
**4.4.3.2 Dynamic Model**  
Let denote the probability that a reservation in the system at the  
start of period survives to period so by Assumption 4.1 \(i\)‚ \(ii\)‚  
and \(iii\) the number of surviving reservations is again binomial.  
The optimality equations for the dynamic model with cancellations be-  
come  
where  
is the expected value function after cancellations in period ary conditions are given by \(4.15\).  
As a result‚ it is optimal to accept an arrival of class The bound-  
if and only if  
**4.4.4 Class-Dependent Cancellation Refunds**  
Again‚ relaxing the fact that cancellation rates or costs depend on  
the class or the time of purchase \(or both\) requires expanding the state  
space and is not practical if one has more than two classes. However‚  
as with no-shows‚ a change of accounting can be used to allow for class-  
dependent refunds. We illustrate the idea for the dynamic model only‚  
but a similar idea applies for the static model.  
Suppose a customer of class who cancels in period is given a refund  
which is strictly less than the revenue we receive‚ All other  
assumptions in Assumption 4.1 hold. As in the no-show case‚ one can  
charge for the expected refund at the time the reservation is accepted *Overbooking* 161  
rather than at the time of service‚ with no resulting difference in total  
expected revenues and costs.  
This is accomplished as follows. Let given to a class reservation from period denote the expected refund  
through to the time of service.  
We can solve for recursively using  
with boundary condition  
We then form the reduced revenue  
and simply use in place of in \(4.17\) to modify the problem formu-  
lation. Note‚ as in the case of no-show refunds‚ that the ordering of  
may be different from the ordering of  
Again‚ the key practical insight here is that the reduced-revenue  
should be used in evaluating the economic benefit of accepting a class  
customer—not the gross-revenue This is because even if a class  
gives a higher current revenue‚ much of that revenue may be forfeited  
on average‚ so the net benefit of accepting it can be quite different from  
the gross revenue.  
**4.5 Substitutable Capacity**  
We next look at an overbooking problem with multiple classes and  
multiple resources \(types of capacity\). Here‚ we assume classes corre-  
spond to different products a customer can purchase‚ while resources  
are physically different‚ albeit related‚ types of capacity. The multiple  
capacity types may be used to satisfy the demand of a given class—or  
multiple classes may use a single capacity type. A prominent example is  
overbooking jointly in multiple cabins of an aircraft \(coach and business  
class\)‚ where the first-class cabin serves as a substitute capacity if the  
coach cabin is oversold. Another example is overbooking on back-to-  
back scheduled flights between a pair of cities‚ where customers booked  
on an early flight can be served \(perhaps at a cost\) on a later flight.  
Hotels with multiple room types and car rental fleets with multiple car  
types are further examples. The case of a single resource with multiple  
classes can be applied to a traditional single-resource problem to control  
overbooking when cancellation rates differ across classes \(for example‚ to  
determine separate overbooking limits for each class based on the joint  
vector of reservations on hand for each class\). All these problems share 162 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
the feature that capacity of a different resource \(such as a later flight‚  
an alternative room type‚ or a vehicle type\) can serve as a substitute in  
the case of oversales.  
In the presence of such substitution effects‚ the overbooking decisions  
for the resources are related. For example‚ we might tolerate a higher  
level of overbooking in the coach cabin of an aircraft if we know that  
the number of bookings in the first-class cabin is low‚ and conversely we  
would be more conservative about overbooking the coach cabin if the  
first-class cabin was fully booked. Therefore‚ the key question in such  
situations is how to jointly determine optimal overbooking levels.  
**4.5.1 Model and Formulation**  
One approach to joint overbooking across resources is to approximate  
this problem as a two-period optimization problem. In the first pe-  
riod \(the *reservation period*\)*‚* we assume reservations are accepted given  
only probabilistic knowledge of cancellations. In the second period \(the  
*service period*\)*‚* cancellations are realized‚ and surviving customers are  
assigned to the various resources to maximize the net benefit of as-  
signments \(for example‚ minimize downgrading penalties\). This gives  
us essentially a multiclass version of the traditional static overbooking  
model.  
Let denoted the number of classes and denote the number of  
resources. In the reservation period‚ assume that for each class we  
currently have reservations on hand. \(This is the current “state.”\) The  
decision variables are the maximum number of reservations we are willing  
to hold after the reservation period is over‚ denoted by  
These decision variables have to satisfy for all since  
the maximum number of reservations after the reservation period must  
be at least as large as the number at the start of the reservation period.  
\(There are no cancellations *during* the reservation period.\)  
In the service period‚ cancellations and no-shows are realized‚ and  
all remaining customers are either assigned to one of resources‚ in-  
dexed by or they are denied service. This assignment of customers  
to resources is modeled as a deterministic network-flow problem. The  
following notation is used\:  
The net benefit of assigning a customer of class during service period \(objective function coefficients\).  
to resource  
The capacity of resource  
The number of customers of class period \(number of survivals\).  
that show up at the service *Overbooking* 163  
The number of customers among the who showed up assigned  
to resource during the service period \(decision variables\).  
One can add a virtual resource, type to account for denied  
service. This resource has finite but very high capacity, and assigning a  
customer to it means that the customer is denied service. The assign-  
ment variables corresponding to the virtual resource are and the  
objective function coefficients take into account the loss-of-goodwill  
cost incurred by denying service to customers of reservation class as  
well as any other direct compensation costs.  
Let **z** denote the of show demand and **C** denote the  
of resource capacities \(including the denied-service, virtual-  
resource capacity, The maximum value obtained during the service  
period is denoted by *V*\(**z**, **C**\). The allocation problem can be represented  
as  
\(TP\) is a transportation problem in which the supplies are customers  
requesting service and demands are the available capacities. Let the  
dual variables associated with constraints \(4.18\) and \(4.19\) in *\(TP\)* be  
respectively.  
To formulate the reservation-period problem‚ let be the show de-  
mand for customers from class This show demand is‚ of course‚ a  
function of the number of accepted reservations‚ so We  
let denote the probability that a class reservation shows up in the  
service period. Several models can be used for this show demand‚ most  
naturally the binomial model discussed in Section 4.2.1. But it is use-  
ful theoretically and computationally to approximate the binomial with  
a Poisson distribution‚ in which case‚ booking limits can be treated as  
continuous variables.  
Let and  
Let the price and refund \(on cancellation\) vectors for the classes be de-  
noted by **p** and **s**‚ where we assume Finally‚ let *G*\(**x**\) be the  
expected value of future revenues and costs \(*net revenue*\) as a function  
of the final overbooking level‚ **x**. 164 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The reservation period problem is‚ then‚  
where  
and the expectation above is with respect to the random vector of sur-  
vivals *Z*\(**x**\).  
**4.5.2 Joint Optimal Overbooking Levels**  
The following proposition shows how the overbooking levels for the  
classes are related if show demand is modeled as a Poisson random vari-  
able\:  
PROPOSITION 4.4 *If for each uted random variable with mean \(4.21\) is component-wise concave in each is a Poisson distrib-*  
*then the function G*\(**x**\) *defined by*  
*and submod-*  
*ular in* **x**. *That is‚ letting denote the unit vector‚ for all the*  
*first differences*  
*are decreasing in*  
The component-wise concavity of the expected net revenue function  
implies that there are critical booking levels for each class beyondwhich  
the expected value does not increase‚ provided booking levels of other  
classes are kept constant. The submodularity property implies that the  
optimal booking limit for class is nonincreasing in the booking limit  
for any other class These are natural and intuitive properties.  
They simply reflect the fact that low reservation levels in one class mean  
that capacity will be less constrained in the service period‚ and this in  
turn reduces the potential costs of overbooking in other classes because  
more \(or at least less costly\) substitution options will be available.  
In Appendix 4.A we give a stochastic gradient method for computing  
the optimal joint overbooking limits. It solves \(4.20\) in the case of the  
Poisson cancellation model using a simulation-based‚ stochastic gradient  
algorithm. The following example illustrates how this method compares  
with the independent binomial model\:  
**Example 4.5** There are four consecutive flights between the same city pair. For  
simplicity‚ assume that all four flights serve one class each and each flight has the  
same capacity of 100. Flights are ordered in time \(the earliest flight is flight 1\).  
Overbooking leads to substitution forward in time‚ so customers denied boarding on *Overbooking* 165  
an oversold flight can take later flights with some loss of goodwill. Denying service  
completely to a customer results in a higher cost compared with the cost of goodwill  
due to delays. Delaying a customer by one flight costs \$300; delaying by two flights  
costs \$400; delaying by three flights is \$500. The cost of denying service to a customer  
on any flight is \$1‚000. The unit revenue for reservations is \$500‚ which is fully  
refundable on cancellation. There are 10 reservation periods in the planning horizon‚  
and the survival probabilities are 0.81‚ 0.82‚ . . . ‚ 0.90 from the first period to the last.  
Flights 1 and 4 receive 30% of reservation demand‚ while flights 2 and 3 receive only  
20% each.  
Figure 4.3 shows the overbooking limits and final average show demand for the  
multiclass‚ stochastic gradient method \(SOPT\) and binomial model \(BIN\) for this  
example. Note that the SOPT procedure is much more aggressive in overbooking  
flight 1 than flight 4 even though they have the same demand. This is natural‚ since  
overselling flight 1 is less costly because passengers can be put onto later flights;  
oversold passengers on flight 4 must be denied service. Indeed‚ SOPT in a sense  
deliberately “plans” oversales on flight 1‚ since delayed customers on these flights  
generate more revenue than penalties. This results in nearly 5% of passengers being  
delayed for one or more flights‚ while with the BIN procedure only 0.5% of passengers  
are delayed. Nevertheless‚ the multiclass model produces a 1.4% increase in revenues  
\(net of penalty costs\) over the independent binomial model‚ as the increased revenues  
more than compensate for the increase in delay penalties.  
While the parameters of this example are not the most realistic‚ the  
example illustrates how coordinated overbooking policies for related re-  
sources may differ from those computed using independent models. 166 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**4.6 Network Overbooking**  
We next consider how to set overbooking levels on a network. The  
capacities of network resources are key inputs to capacity-control prob-  
lems. Using overbooking‚ these capacities may be inflated—defining  
virtual capacities for each resource that exceed the physical capacity.  
This increase in capacity‚ in turn‚ affects the accept or reject decisions  
of the capacity-control method. On the other hand‚ capacity-control  
decisions clearly influence the opportunity cost of capacity‚ which is a  
key input to economic overbooking models. Hence‚ the total revenue for  
a network \(net of penalties\) is affected both by overbooking and seat  
inventory-control practices. Despite the strong interdependence of these  
decisions‚ the two problems are typically separated in practice.  
In this section‚ we look at one model for coordinating network-capacity  
controls and overbooking decisions. The method combines the deter-  
ministic linear programming model of Section 3.3.1 with a single-period  
overbooking model‚ though it can be adapted to other network approx-  
imations as well \(such as PNLP and RLP\).  
As in Chapter 3‚ consider a network with products and resources.  
We divide the time horizon into two periods\: a reservation period‚ and  
a service period. The reservation period spans \(0‚ *T*\] and is the period  
the reservations can be made for any of the products. The reservation  
period is followed by the service period‚ during which the customers with  
reservations show up or become no-shows. During the service period‚ the  
firm may deny service to customers who show up in case of insufficient  
capacity‚ in which case it pays a penalty.  
The demand or reservation requests arrive according to a stochas-  
tic process during \(0‚*T*\] . As before‚ let denote the  
vector of prices and the vector of resource capaci-  
ties. There is a denied-service cost on each resource given by the vector  
The denied-service cost may differ from one resource  
to another‚ but it does not vary with time or product type. The matrix  
is the usual network incidence matrix with if resource  
is used by product and otherwise. Recall denotes the  
row and the column of matrix **A**. For simplicity‚ we ignore  
refund for cancellations or no-shows‚ but this can be included easily in  
this model.  
One way to formulate this overbooking problem is as a two-stage‚ sta-  
tic model that combines the DLP model and the cost-based overbooking  
models. The same formulation applies to a variety of network bid-price  
methods‚ though we focus on the DLP method for simplicity. *Overbooking* 167  
The decision variables are **x**‚ the vector of overbooking levels \(virtual  
capacities\)‚ and **y**‚ the vector of primal allocations. \(Note here we are  
changing our running definition of **y** to conform with Chapter 3; that is‚  
**y** is now a vector of capacity allocations not a vector of reservations on  
hand.\) The formulation is as follows\:  
The problem parameters are *E*\[**D**\], the vector of expected demand to  
come for the classes. The objective function is the total revenue-to-  
come, net of denied-service costs.  
Note that the show demand for resource in this formulation is ap-  
proximated by the random variable The actual show demand,  
however, will be less, since the show demand for is *only* if  
the overbooking limit is reached. \(Recall the discussion after Sec-  
tion 4.2.1.1.\) Otherwise, the number of reservation on resource will be  
less than and so the show demand will be less than However,  
this approximation greatly simplifies the model and is a good approxi-  
mation in the important case where demand is high.  
We let denote the overbooking-cost func-  
tion and denote the revenue function in \(4.22\). The  
overbooking-cost function *H* is a nondecreasing and convex function  
of the overbooking limit **x** if the random variable associated with the  
number of survivors for leg is assumed to follow the binomial or  
Poisson model with survival probability Thus, the objective function  
of problem \(4.22\) is jointly concave in **y** and **x** under these two models  
of cancellation. One can use a general-purpose nonlinear programming  
method to solve \(4.22\), but Appendix 4.B provides an algorithm spe-  
cialized to this problem’s structure. The following numerical example  
from \[292\] shows the performance of this method\:  
**Example 4.6** The example here is based on the same network of Williamson \[566\]  
as shown in Figure 3.3 of Chapter 3. The itinerary revenue values and base-case mean  
demand values are show in Table 3.5 of Chapter 3 as well. The cancellation rate is  
assumed to be 15%‚ and the denied service penalty is assumed to be \$1‚000 on all legs.  
Different load factors‚ proportions of local versus through traffic‚ and arrival order  
were simulated to create 4 variations of the problem from the base case. A version  
of the network overbooking model using binomial‚ rather than Poisson‚ assumptions  
of cancellations \(denoted BIN\) was computed to find joint overbooking levels and  
corresponding DLP solutions. The resulting overbooking limits and dual prices were  
then tested by simulation. 168 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
This BIN policy is compared with several versions of ad-hoc overbooking rules.  
Four of these are cost-based overbooking models‚ denoted OBC-1 to OBC-4. They  
differ only in terms of the revenue values used to compute the overbooking limits. Fi-  
nally‚ a deterministic overbooking limit \(DET\) based on the approximation described  
in Section 4.2.2.1 was also tested. Thus overall five methods are compared with BIN.  
Once overbooking levels were determined‚ a DLP model was solved‚ and the resulting  
bid prices were used to allocate capacity.  
Since no exact methods are known for this problem‚ the deviation from the best of  
the six methods was used as the performance metric. That is‚ the maximum expected  
revenue \(net of penalties\) from all the policies is computed and for each individual  
policy‚ and the percentage deviation from this maximum is recorded.  
Figure 4.4 from \[292\] shows the average percentage deviation of the six methods.  
Note that BIN is not always the best method \(its average percentage deviation is  
slightly positive\)‚ but it is better than all the other methods.  
Similar behavior is observed in other examples in \[292\]‚ where BIN  
is not uniformly better than the ad-hoc overbooking mechanisms but is  
never very far from the best policy and moreover is significantly more  
robust than any of the ad-hoc methods. These and other tests of the  
method show the importance of network overbooking; the deviations  
between the best and worst policy can be quite large—several percentage  
points of difference in net revenues.  
**4.7 Notes and Sources**  
Much of the material in Section 4.1.1 comes from the carefully docu-  
mented work of Rothstein \[447–449\] on the development of overbooking *APPENDIX 4.A\: Computations for the Substitutable Capacity Model* 169  
in the airline industry. For papers on overbooking from a policy per-  
spective‚ see Falkson \[180\] and Ruppenthal \[450\]. Overview articles on  
overbooking include Bodily and Pfeifer \[80\]‚ Dunleavy \[165\] and Roth-  
stein \[447‚ 449\].  
There was also much lively debate surrounding the oversale-auction  
idea‚ captured in a series of articles by Simon \[472–475\]. Vickery \[534\]  
proposed using his second-price auction mechanism for the problem as  
well.  
The static overbooking problem of Section 4.2 first appeared in  
a pair of papers by Beckmann \[31‚ 32\]. Other early treatments of  
the static problem are Taylor \[504\]‚ Thompson \[508\]‚ and Rothstein  
and Stone \[446\]. See also Bierman and Thomas \[66\] and Shlifer and  
Vardi \[465\]. Martinez and Sanchez \[362\] test the memoryless property  
of the binomial model empirically.  
The Gram-Charlier approximation in Section 4.2.2.3 is due to Tay-  
lor \[504\] as is the moment-generating-function method presented in Sec-  
tion 4.2.4.  
The material in Section 4.3 on dynamic overbooking is from Chatwin’s  
thesis \(\[107\]\) and subsequent published articles \[108‚ 109\].  
The material on combined allocation and overbooking problem of Sec-  
tion 4.4 is from Subramanian et al. \[494\]‚ who also developed the cost  
transformation technique of Sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.4.  
The multiclass overbooking model with substitution \(and associated  
optimization algorithm\) in Section 4.5 are from Karaesmen and van  
Ryzin \[290\]. The network overbooking model and algorithm presented in  
Section 4.6 is from Karaesmen and van Ryzin \[291\]; see also Karaesmen’s  
thesis \[292\]. Ladany \[320\] analyzes a two-class version of this problem  
for hotels using dynamic programming.  
Some papers on practical considerations in hotel overbooking include  
Lambert et al. \[326\] and Lefever \[337\]. The latter discusses handling  
oversales situations in hotels. For models of hotel overbooking‚ see  
Ladany \[320‚ 321\] and Liberman and Yechiali \[343‚ 344\]. Bitran and  
Gilbert \[71\] analyze the problem of sequentially determining when to  
deny service to arriving customers based on the relative costs of denying  
service early and late in the evening.

# DYNAMIC PRICING  
**5.1 Introduction and Overview**  
In this chapter, we look at settings in which prices rather than quan-  
tity controls are the primary variables used to manage demand. While  
the distinction between quantity and price controls is not always sharp  
\(for instance, closing the availability of a discount class can be consid-  
ered equivalent to raising the product’s price to that of the next highest  
class\), the techniques we look at here are distinguished by their explicit  
use of price as the control variable and their explicit modeling of demand  
as a price-dependent process.  
In terms of business practice, varying prices is often the most nat-  
ural mechanism for revenue management. In most retail and industrial  
trades, firms use various forms of dynamic pricing—including personal-  
ized pricing, markdowns, display and trade promotions, coupons, dis-  
counts, clearance sales, and auctions and price negotiations \(request for  
proposals and request for quotes—RFP/RFQ processes\)—to respond to  
market fluctuations and uncertainty in demand. Exactly how to make  
such price adjustments in a way that maximizes revenues \(or profits, in  
the case where variable costs are involved\) is the subject of this chapter.  
Dynamic pricing is as old as commerce itself. Firms and individu-  
als have always resorted to price adjustments \(such as haggling at the  
bazaar\) in an effort to sell their goods at a price that is as high as possi-  
ble yet acceptable to customers. However, the last decade has witnessed  
an increased application of scientific methods and software systems for  
dynamic pricing, both in the estimation of demand functions and the  
optimization of pricing decisions. 176  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**5.1.1 Price versus Quantity-Based RM**  
Some industries use price-based RM \(retailing\), whereas others use  
quantity-based RM \(airlines\). Even in the same industry, firms may use  
a mixture of price- and quantity-based RM. For instance, many of the  
RM practices of the new low-cost airlines more closely resemble dynamic  
pricing than the quantity-based RM of the traditional carriers. What  
explains these differences?  
It is hard to give a definitive answer, and indeed Chapter 8 is devoted  
to different theoretical explanations of RM practice. But in essence,  
it boils down to a question of the extent to which a firm is able to  
vary quantity or price in response to changes in market conditions. This  
ability, in turn, is determined by the commitments a firm makes \(to price  
or quantity\), its level of flexibility in supplying products or services, and  
the costs of making quantity or price changes.  
Consider airlines, for example. While arguably less true today than  
in the past, airlines normally commit to prices for their various fare  
products in advance of taking bookings. This is due to advertising con-  
straints \(such as the desire to publish fares in print media and fare  
tariff books\), distribution constraints, and a desire to simplify the task  
of managing prices. For these marketing and administrative reasons,  
most airlines advertise and price fare products on an aggregate origin-  
destination market level, for a number of flights over a given interval of  
time, and do not price on a departure-by-departure basis. This limits  
their ability to use price to manage the demand on any given departure,  
demand that varies considerably by flight and is quite uncertain at the  
time of the price posting. At the same time, the supply of the various  
classes is almost perfectly flexible between the products \(subject to the  
capacity constraint of the flight\), since all fare products sold in the same  
cabin of service share a homogeneous seat capacity. It is this combina-  
tion of price commitments together with flexibility on the supply side  
that make quantity-based RM an attractive tactic in the airline industry.  
Hotels, cruise ships, and rental cars—other common quantity-based RM  
industries—share many of these same attributes.  
In other cases, however, firms have more price flexibility than quantity  
flexibility. In apparel retailing, for example, firms commit to order quan-  
tities well in advance of a sales season—and may even commit to certain  
stocking levels in each store. Often, it is impossible \(or very costly\) to  
reorder stock or reallocate inventory from one store to another. At the  
same time, it is easier \(though not costless\) for most retailers to change  
prices, as this may require only changing signage and making data en-  
tries into a point-of-sale system. Online retailers in particular enjoy  
tremendous price flexibility because changing prices is almost costless. *Dynamic Pricing* 177  
Business-to-business sales are often conducted through a RFP/RFQ  
process, which allows firms to determine prices on a transaction-by-  
transaction basis. In all these situations, price-based RM is therefore  
a more natural practice. Of course, the context could dictate a different  
choice even in these industries. For example, if a retailer commits to  
advertised prices in different regional markets yet retains a centralized  
stock of products, it might then choose to manage demand by tactically  
allocating its supply to these different regions—a quantity-based RM  
approach.  
However, given the choice between price- and quantity-based RM, one  
can argue that price-based RM is the preferred option. The argument  
is as follows \(see Gallego and van Ryzin \[199\]\). Quantity-based RM  
operates by rationing the quantity sold to different products or to differ-  
ent segments of customers. But rationing, by its very nature, involves  
reducing sales by *limiting* supply. If one has price flexibility, however,  
rather than reducing sales by *limiting supply,* we can reduce sales by  
*increasing price.* This achieves the same quantity-reducing function as  
rationing, but does it more profitably because by increasing price we  
both reduce sales *and* increase revenue at the same time. In short,  
price-based “rationing” is simply a more profitable way to limit sales  
than quantity-based rationing.  
In practice, of course, firms rarely have the luxury of choosing price  
and quantity flexibility. Therefore, practical business constraints dictate  
which tactical response—price- or quantity-based RM \(or a mixture of  
both\)—is most appropriate in any given business context.  
**5.1.2 Industry Overview**  
To give a sense of the scope of activity in the area of dynamic pricing,  
we next review pricing innovations in a few industries.  
**5.1.2.1 Retailing**  
Retailers, especially in apparel and other seasonal-goods sectors, have  
been at the forefront in deploying science-based software for pricing,  
driven primarily by the importance of pricing decisions to retailers’ prof-  
its. For example, Kmart alone wrote off \$400 million due to markdowns  
in one quarter of 2001, resulting in a 40% decline in its net income \[194\].  
Several software firms specializing in RM in retailing have recently  
emerged. Most of this software is currently oriented toward optimizing  
markdown decisions. Demand models fit to historical point-of-sale data  
together with data on available inventory serve as inputs to optimiza- 178  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
tion models that recommend the timing and magnitude of markdown  
decisions.  
Major retailers—including Gymboree, J. C. Penney, L. L. Bean, Liz  
Claiborne, Safeway, ShopKo, and Walgreen’s—are experimenting with  
this new generation of software \[194, 214, 270, 379\]. Many have re-  
ported significant improvements in revenue from using pricing models  
and software. For example, ShopKo reported a 24% improvement in  
gross margins as a result of using its model-based pricing software \[270\]  
and other retailers report gains in gross margins of 5% to 15% \[194\].  
Academic studies based on retail data have also documented significant  
improvements in revenues using model-based markdown recommenda-  
tions \[70, 247\].  
**5.1.2.2 Manufacturing**  
Scientific approaches to pricing are gaining acceptance in the manu-  
facturing sector as well. For example, Ford Motor Co. reported a high-  
profile implementation of pricing-software technology to support pricing  
and discounts for its products \[135\]. The project, started in 1995, fo-  
cused on identifying features that customers were most willing to pay  
for and changing salesforce incentives to focus on profit margins rather  
than unit-sale volumes. Ford then applied pricing models developed by  
an outside consulting firm to optimize prices and dealer and customer  
incentives across its various product lines. In 1998, Ford reported that  
the first five U.S. sales regions using this new pricing approach collec-  
tively beat their profit targets by \$1 billion, while the 13 that used their  
old methods fell short of their targets by about \$250 million \[135\].  
**5.1.2.3 E-business**  
E-commerce has also had a strong influence on the practice of pric-  
ing \[529\]. Companies such as eBay and Priceline have demonstrated the  
viability of using innovative pricing mechanisms that leverage the ca-  
pabilities of the Internet. E-tailers can discount and markdown on the  
fly based on customer loyalty and click-stream behavior. Since a large  
e-tailer like Amazon.com has to make a large number of such pricing  
decisions based on real-time information, automating decision making  
is a natural priority. The success of these e-commerce companies—  
inconsistent and volatile as it may appear at times—is at least partly  
responsible for the increased interest among traditional retailers in using  
more innovative approaches to pricing.  
On the industrial side, e-commerce pricing has been influenced by the  
growth of business-to-business \(B2B\) exchanges and other innovations  
in using the Internet to gain trading efficiencies. While this sector too *Dynamic Pricing* 179  
has had its ebbs and flows, it has produced an astounding variety of new  
pricing and trading mechanisms, some of which are use regularly for  
the sale products such as raw materials, generic commodity items and  
excess inventory. For example, Freemarkets has had significant success  
in providing software and service for industrial-procurement auctions,  
and as of this writing claims to have facilitated over \$30 billion in trade  
since its founding in 1999. Covisint—an exchange jointly funded by  
Daimler-Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors—while  
slow to develop, looks nevertheless to become a permanent feature of  
the auto-industry procurement market. Most infrastructure software for  
B2B exchanges—sold by firms such as Ariba, i2, IBM, and Commerce  
One—also has various forms of dynamic pricing capabilities built in.  
For all these reasons, e-commerce has given price-based RM a signifi-  
cant boost in recent years.  
**5.1.3 Examples of Dynamic Pricing**  
We next examine three specific example of dynamic pricing and the  
qualitative factors driving price changes in each case.  
**5.1.3.1 Style-Goods Markdown Pricing**  
Retailers of style and seasonal goods use markdown pricing to clear ex-  
cess inventory before the end of the season. This type of price-based RM  
is most prevalent in apparel, sporting goods, high-tech, and perishable-  
foods retailing. The main incentive for price reductions in such cases is  
that goods perish or have low salvage values once the sales season is over;  
hence, firms have an incentive to sell inventory while they can, even at  
a low price, rather than salvage it.  
But apart from inventory considerations, there are other proposed  
explanations for markdown pricing. One explanation, proposed by  
Lazear \[332\] \(see Examples 8.11 and 8.12\) and investigated empirically  
in Pashigan \[415\] and Pashigan and Bowen \[414\], is that retailers are un-  
certain about which products will be popular with customers. Therefore,  
firms set high prices for all items initially. Products that are popular  
are the ones for which customers have high reservation prices, so these  
sell out at the high initial price. The firm then identifies the remaining  
items as low-reservation-price products and marks them down. In this  
explanation, markdown pricing serves as a form of demand learning.  
A second explanation for markdowns is that customers who purchase  
early have higher willingness to pay, either because they can use the  
product for a full season \(a bathing suit at the start of summer\) or be-  
cause there is some cache to being the first to own it \(a new dress style  
or electronic gadget\). Markdown pricing then serves as a segmenta- 180  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
tion mechanism to separate price-insensitive customers from those price-  
sensitive customers willing to defer consumption to get a lower price.  
Warner and Birsky \[554\] give yet another explanation, with empirical  
evidence, for markdown pricing. On holidays and during peak-shopping  
periods \(such as before Christmas\), customers can search for the low-  
est prices more efficiently because they are actively engaged in search,  
making many shopping trips over a concentrated period of time. Even  
those customers who normally do not spend much time searching for the  
best price change their behavior during these peak shopping periods and  
become more vigilant. The result is that demand during peak periods  
is more price-sensitive and retailers respond by running “sales” during  
these periods.  
**5.1.3.2 Discount Airline Pricing**  
Not all dynamic pricing involves price reductions, however. As we  
mentioned earlier, discount airlines use primarily price-based RM, but  
with prices often going up over time. These airlines \(some examples are  
easyJet and Ryanair in Europe and JetBlue in the U.S.\) typically offer  
only one type of ticket on each flight, a non-refundable, one-way fare  
without advance-purchase restrictions. However, they offer these tickets  
at different prices for different flights, and moreover, during the booking  
period for each flight, vary prices dynamically based on capacity and  
demand for that specific departure. To quote from one practitioner of  
this type of dynamic pricing \(Easyjet website, 2003\)\:  
The way we structure our fares is based on supply and demand and prices  
usually increase as seats are sold on every flight. So, generally speaking, the  
earlier you book, the cheaper the fare will be. Sometimes, however, due to  
market forces our fares may be reduced further. Our booking system contin-  
ually reviews bookings for all future flights and tries to predict how popular  
each flight is likely to be.  
Figure 5.1 shows the evolution of prices for a particular European  
discount airline flight as a function of the number of weeks prior to  
departure. Note that prices are highest in the last few weeks prior to  
departure.  
There are some fundamental differences between air travel and style-  
and seasonal-goods products that explain this increasing price pattern.  
For one, the value of air travel to customers does not necessarily go down  
as the deadline approaches. Conversely, the value of a ticket earlier on  
is lower for customers as customers multiply the value by the probabil-  
ity that they will indeed use the ticket \(especially for a non-refundable  
ticket\). Somewhat related to these points, additionally, although cus-  
tomers purchase tickets at different points of time, all customers consume *Dynamic Pricing* 181  
the product \(fly the flight\) at the same time. So two factors come into  
play. Customers who purchased early may get upset to see prices drop  
while they are still holding a reservation; indeed, many airlines give a  
price guarantee to refund the difference if there is a price drop \(to en-  
courage passengers to book early\), making it costly for the firms to lower  
prices. And in the travel business, high-valuation high-uncertainty cus-  
tomers tend to purchase closer to the time of service. Hence, demand is  
less price-sensitive close to the time of service.  
**5.1.3.3 Consumer-Packaged Goods Promotions**  
In contrast to markdown and discount airline pricing, promotions are  
short-run, temporary price reductions. Promotions are the most com-  
mon form of price-based RM in the consumer packaged-goods \(CPG\)  
industry \(soap, diapers, coffee, yogurt, and so on\).  
The fact that customers purchase CPG products repeatedly has im-  
portant implications for pricing and promotions. Specifically, customers  
are aware of past prices and past promotions, so running promotions too  
frequently may condition customers to view the brand as a frequently  
discounted product, cutting into brand equity in the long run. Because  
customers are aware of past prices, promotions impact their subjective  
“reference price”—or sense of the “fair” price—for products. And cus-  
tomers may *stockpile* products, so short-run increases in demand due to  
promotions may come at the expense of reduced future demand. 182  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The institutional structure of promotions is also more complicated.  
There are three parties involved—manufacturers, retailers, and end cus-  
tomers. Promotions are run either by a manufacturer as discounts to  
retailers \(trade promotions\), which may or may not be passed on to  
the customers by the retailers \(retailer pass-thru\), or by retailers \(re-  
tail promotions or consumer promotions\). In some forms of promotion  
\(e.g., mail-in coupons\) manufacturers gives a discount directly to the  
end customer.  
The motivations of the manufacturer and the retailer are different as  
well. While a manufacturer is interested in increasing sales or profits  
for its brand, retailers are interested in overall sales or profits for a cat-  
egory constituting multiple brands from multiple manufacturers. For  
a retailer, discounting a particular brand may increase sales for that  
brand but dilute overall category profits as customers switch from high-  
margin brands to the discounted brand. So in designing optimal pro-  
motions structures, one has to consider complex incentive compatibility  
constraints.  
**5.1.4 Modeling Dynamic Price-Sensitive Demand**  
Any dynamic-pricing model requires a model of how demand—either  
individual or aggregate—responds to changes in price. The basic theory  
of consumer choice and the resulting market-response models are covered  
in Chapter 7. We draw on these models in this chapter.  
However, in dynamic-pricing problems some additional factors must  
be considered. The first concerns how individual customers behave over  
time—what factors influence their purchase decisions and how sophisti-  
cated their decision-making process is, and so on. The second concerns  
the state of market conditions—specifically the level of competition and  
the size of the customer population. We next look at each of these  
assumptions qualitatively.  
**5.1.4.1 Myopic- Versus Strategic-Customer Models**  
One important demand-modeling assumption concerns the level of  
sophistication of customers. Most of the models we consider in this  
chapter assume *myopic customers*—those who buy as soon as the offered  
price is less than their willingness to pay. Myopic customers do not  
adopt complex buying strategies, such as refusing to buy in the hope  
of lower prices in the future. They simply buy the first time the price  
drops below their willingness to pay. Models that incorporate *strategic*  
*customers,* in contrast, allow for the fact that customers will optimize  
their own purchase behavior in response to the pricing strategies of the  
firms. *Dynamic Pricing* 183  
Of course, the strategic-customer model is more realistic. However,  
such a demand model makes the pricing problem essentially a strate-  
gic game between the customers and the firm, and this significantly  
complicates the estimation and analysis of optimal pricing strategies—  
often making the problem intractable. In contrast, the myopic-customer  
model is much more tractable and hence is more widely used. The issue  
in practice is really a matter of how “bad” the myopic assumption is in  
any given context. In many situations, customers are sufficiently spon-  
taneous in making decisions that one can ignore their strategic behavior.  
Moreover, customers often do not have the sufficient time or information  
to behave very strategically. However, the more expensive and durable  
the purchase, the more important it becomes to model strategic cus-  
tomer behavior \(for example, automobile buyers waiting to purchase at  
the end of a model year\).  
One common defense of the myopic assumption is the following. The  
forecasting models that use observations of past customer behavior in  
a sense reflects the effects of our customers’ strategic behavior. For  
example, if the customers who are most price-sensitive tend to adopt  
a strategy of postponing their purchases until end-of-season clearance  
sales, then the estimated price sensitivity in these later periods will tend  
to appear much higher than in earlier periods. Therefore, even though  
we do not model the strategic behavior directly, our forecasting models  
indirectly capture the correct price response.  
This view is plausible if the pricing strategies obtained from a model  
are roughly similar to past policies, so that they can be viewed as “per-  
turbations” or “fine tuning” of a historical pricing strategy—a strategy  
that customers have already factored into their behavior. On the other  
hand, if optimized pricing recommendations are radically different in  
structure from past pricing strategies, then it is reasonable to expect  
that customers will adjust their buying strategies in response. If this  
happens, the predictions of myopic models that are fit to historical data  
may be very bad indeed.  
Yet even when the myopic approach works \(in the sense of correctly  
predicting price responses\), it runs the risk of reinforcing “bad equilib-  
rium” pricing strategies. For example, a myopic model fit to past data  
may reconfirm the “optimality” of lowering prices significantly at the  
end of a sales season or running periodic holiday sales because it esti-  
mates, based on historical data, that demand is especially price-sensitive  
in these periods. But this price sensitivity may be due to the fact that  
customers have learned not to buy at other times, because they know  
prices will be cut at the end of the season or during holidays. If the firm  
was to adopt a constant price strategy—and customers were convinced 184  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
that the firm was sticking to this strategy—then the observed price sen-  
sitivity might shift. The resulting equilibrium might be more profitable,  
but it is one that the firm would not discover using a myopic-customer  
model.  
Despite these limitations and potential pitfalls of the myopic model,  
it is practical, is widely used, and provides useful insight into dynamic  
pricing. We therefore focus on the myopic case for the most part in  
this chapter. However, we consider strategic customers in Section 5.5.2  
below and in considerably more depth in Chapter 6, where we look at  
auctions, the analysis of which is entirely based on strategic-customer  
models.  
**5.1.4.2 Infinite- Versus Finite-Population Models**  
Another important assumption in demand modeling is whether the  
population of potential customers is finite or infinite. Of course, in  
reality, every population of customers is finite; the question is really a  
matter of whether the number and type of customers that have already  
bought changes one’s estimate of the number or type of future customers.  
In an infinite-population model, we assume that we are sampling *with*  
*replacement* when observing customers. As a result, the distribution of  
the number of customers and the distribution of their willingness to pay  
is not affected by the past history of observed demand. This is often  
termed the *nondurable-goods assumption* in economics because we can  
view this as a case where customers immediately consume their purchase  
and then reenter the population of potential customers \(say, for a can of  
Coke\). This assumption is convenient analytically because one does not  
need to retain the history of demand \(or a suitable sufficient statistic\)  
as a state variable in a pricing-optimization problem.  
The finite-population model assumes a random process *without re-*  
*placement.* That is, there are a finite \(possibly random\) number of cus-  
tomers with heterogeneous willingness to pay values. If one of the cus-  
tomers in the population purchases, the customer is removed from the  
population of potential customers, and therefore future purchases only  
occur from the remaining customers. This is termed the *durable-goods*  
*assumption* in economics because we can consider it as a case where the  
good being purchased is consumed over a long period of time \(for exam-  
ple, an automobile\) and hence once a customer purchases, he effectively  
removes himself from the population of potential customers.  
For example, suppose we assume a price is offered in period  
and all customers who value the item at more than purchase in  
period \(myopic behavior\). Then, under a finite-population model, we  
know that after period the remaining customers all have valuations *Dynamic Pricing* 185  
less than In particular, the future distribution of willingness to  
pay is conditioned on the values being less than As a result, in  
formulating a dynamic-pricing problem, we have to keep track of past  
pricing decisions and their effect on the residual population of customers.  
Which of these models is most appropriate depends on the context.  
While often the infinite-population model is used simply because it is  
easier to deal with analytically, the key factors in choosing one model  
over the other are the number of potential customers relative to the num-  
ber that actually buy and the type of good \(durable versus nondurable\).  
Specifically, the infinite-population model is a reasonable approximation  
when there is a large population of potential customers and the firm’s  
demand represents a relatively small fraction of this population because  
in such cases the impact of the firm’s past sales on the number of cus-  
tomers and the distribution of their valuations is negligible. It is also  
reasonable for consumable goods. However, if the firm’s demand repre-  
sents a large fraction of the potential pool of customers or if the product  
is a durable good, then past sales will have a more significant impact on  
the statistics of future demand, and the finite-population assumption is  
more appropriate.  
Qualitatively, the two models lead to quite different pricing policies.  
Most notably, finite-population models typically lead to *price skimming*  
as an optimal strategy, in which prices are lowered over time in such a  
way that high-valuation customers pay higher prices earlier while low-  
valuation customers pay lower prices in later periods. Effectively, this  
creates a form of second-degree price discrimination, segmenting cus-  
tomers with different values for the good and charging differential prices  
over time. In infinite-population models, there is no such price-skimming  
incentive. Provided the distribution of customer valuations does not shift  
over time, the same price that yields a high revenue in one period will  
yield a high revenue in later periods, and thus a firm has no incentive  
to deviate from this revenue-maximizing price.  
**5.1.4.3 Monopoly, Oligopoly, and Perfect-Competition**  
# Models  
Another key assumption in dynamic-pricing models concerns the level  
of competition the firm faces. Many pricing models used in RM practice  
are *monopoly models,* in which the demand a firm faces is assumed to de-  
pend only on its own price and not on the price of its competitors. Thus,  
the model does not explicitly consider the competitive reaction to a price  
change. Again, one makes this assumption primarily for tractability and  
is not always realistic. 186  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
As with the myopic-customer model, the monopoly model can be  
partly justified on empirical grounds—namely, that an observed histor-  
ical price response has embedded in it the effects of competitors’ re-  
sponses to the firm’s pricing strategy. So for instance, if a firm decides  
to lower its price, the firm’s competitors might respond by lowering their  
prices. With market prices lower, the firm and its competitors see an  
increase in demand. The observed increase in demand is then mea-  
sured empirically and treated as the “monopoly” demand response to  
the firm’s price change in a dynamic-pricing model—even though com-  
petitive effects are at work.  
Again, while such a view is pragmatic and reflects the conventional  
wisdom behind the pricing models used in practice, there are some dan-  
gers inherent in it, paralleling those of the myopic-customer model. The  
price-sensitivity estimates may prove wrong if the optimized strategy de-  
viates significantly from past strategies because then the resulting com-  
petitive response may be quite different from the historical response.  
Also, the practice runs the risk of reinforcing “bad” equilibrium re-  
sponses. Despite these risks, monopoly models have still proved to be  
valuable for decision support.  
It is worth noting that oligopoly models, in which the equilibrium-  
price response of competitors is explicitly modeled and computed, also  
have their pitfalls. Most notably, the assumption that firms behave ra-  
tionally \(or quasi-rationally, if heuristics are used in place of optimal  
strategies\) may result in a poor predictor of their actual price response.  
These potential modeling errors together with the increased complexity  
of analyzing oligopoly models—and the difficulty in collecting competi-  
tor data to estimate the models accurately—has made them less popular  
in practice. Shugan \[468\] provides a good summary of this point of view;  
he notes that “the strong approximating assumption of no competitive  
response is sometimes better than the approximating assumption of pre-  
existing optimal behavior.” However, properly designed and validated,  
oligopoly models can provide valuable insights on issues of pricing strat-  
egy.  
Finally, one can also consider perfectly competitive models—in which  
many competing firms supply an identical commodity. As described in  
Section 8.2, the output of each firm is assumed to be small relative the  
market size, and this, combined with the fact that each firm is offer-  
ing identical commodities, means that a firm cannot influence market *Dynamic Pricing* 187  
prices.1 Therefore, each firm is essentially a *price taker*—able to sell as  
much as it wants at the prevailing market price but unable to sell any-  
thing at higher prices. Despite the importance of perfect-competition  
models in economic theory, the assumption that firms have no pricing  
power means that the results are not that useful for price-based RM.  
Nevertheless, they do play a role in quantity-based RM. For example,  
one can interpret the capacity-control models of Chapters 2 and 3 as  
stemming from competitive, price-taking models; firms take the price  
for their various products as given \(set by competitive market forces\),  
and control only the quantity they supply \(the availability or allocation\)  
at these competitive prices. As our focus in the chapter is on price-  
based RM, we do not consider this model of competition further in this  
chapter.  
**5.2 Single-Product Dynamic Pricing Without**  
# Replenishment  
The first problem we look at is dynamic pricing of a single product  
over a finite sales horizon given a fixed inventory at the start of the  
sales horizon. We assume that the firm is a monopolist, customers are  
myopic, and there is no replenishment of inventory.  
The models are representative of the type used in style and seasonal  
goods retail RM. For such retailers, production and ordering cycles are  
typically much larger than the sales season, and the main challenge is  
to determine the price path of a particular style at a particular store  
location, given a fixed set of inventory at the beginning of the season.  
At one level, such models are simplistic\: they consider only a single  
product in isolation and assume customers are myopic, and therefore  
demand is a function solely of time and the current price \(although  
other factors such as inventory depletion are sometimes included\). They  
therefore ignore competition, the impact of substitution, and the pos-  
sible strategic behavior of customers over time. Despite these simpli-  
fications, the models provide good rough-cut approximations and are  
useful in practice. In addition, by decomposing the problem and treat-  
ing products independently, it is possible to solve such models efficiently  
even when there are hundreds of thousands of product-location combi-  
nations. Finally, even with the simplifying assumptions, the analysis can  
1This is in contrast to the Cournot model of quantity competition discussed in Section 8.4, in  
which there are only a small number of firms whose quantity decisions do affect the market  
price. Roughly speaking, Cournot competition approaches perfect competition as the number  
of firms in the industry tends to infinity. 188  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
still become complex if we allow stochastic demand and put constraints  
on prices.  
Since we consider only a single product, there is a single \(scalar\) price  
decision at each time denoted which induces a unique \(scalar\)  
demand rate The set of allowable prices is denoted and  
denotes the set of achievable demand rates. We assume that these func-  
tions satisfy the regularity conditions in Assumptions 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3  
unless otherwise specified. These include several regularity properties,  
which we summarize here\:  
The demand functions are continuously differentiable and strictly de-  
creasing, Hence, they have an inverse, denoted  
The demand functions are bounded above and below and tend to zero  
for sufficiently high prices—namely,  
The revenue functions \(equivalently  
are finite for all and have a finite maximizer interior to  
The marginal revenue as a function of demand, defined by  
is strictly decreasing in \(Assumption 7.2\)  
Readers who are not familiar with demand functions are encouraged  
to review Section 7.3 for more discussion of these and other related  
properties of demand functions. As discussed in Section 7.3, the demand  
function can also be expressed as where is  
the market-size parameter and is the fraction of the market with  
willingness to pay less than We let denote the inventory at time  
where *T* is the number of periods in the sale horizon. The  
initial inventory is  
**5.2.1 Deterministic Models**  
The simplest deterministic pricing model is formulated in discrete  
time as follows. Given an initial inventory select a sequence  
of prices \(inducing demand rates of that maximize total  
revenues. Formulating the problem in terms of the demand rates *Dynamic Pricing* 189  
the optimal rates must solve  
Let recall that are  
be the Lagrange multiplier on the inventory constraint, and  
denotes the marginal revenue. Then the  
first-order necessary conditions for the optimal rates and multiplier  
subject to the complementary slackness condition  
and the multiplier nonnegativity constraint Under Assump-  
tion 7.2, is decreasing in and so is concave; hence, these  
conditions are also sufficient.  
The optimality conditions are quite intuitive. The Lagrange multiplier  
has the interpretation as the marginal opportunity cost of capacity.  
The condition says that the marginal revenue should  
equal the marginal opportunity cost of capacity in each period. This  
makes sense because if marginal revenues and costs are not balanced, we  
can increase revenues by reallocating sales \(by adjusting prices\) from a  
period of low marginal revenue to a period of higher marginal revenue.  
Finally, the complementary slackness condition says that the opportu-  
nity cost cannot be positive if there is an excess of stock. If the op-  
portunity cost is zero then if we maximize revenue without  
a constraint in every period \(pricing to the point where marginal rev-  
enue is zero\), we will still not exhaust the supply. This means it can be  
optimal—even in the absence of any costs for capacity—not to sell all  
the available supply.  
Note that this problem is essentially equivalent to the problem of opti-  
mal third-degree price discrimination \(see Section 8.3.3.2\) if we consider  
customers in each period to be different segments who are offered dis-  
criminatory prices Another way of viewing the above argument is  
that the firm, faced with a capacity constraint, decides how much to sell  
in each period, and its optimal allocation of capacity occurs when the 190  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
marginal revenue in all the periods are the same. The following example  
illustrates the idea\:  
**Example 5.1** Consider a two-period selling horizon, where during the first period  
demand is given by and in period 2 demand is given by  
\(Customers in the second period are more price-sensitive than those in the  
first period.\) Purchase behavior is assumed to be myopic. Considered separately,  
the revenue-maximizing price for the first period \(maximizing \)  
is given by and and in the second period by  
\(maximizing  
Intertemporal effects come into play if the firm has only a limited number of items  
to sell \(less than 50+60\). Suppose the firm’s capacity is 40. How should it divide the  
sale between the two periods?  
Note that here, and Consider the table  
of marginal values, Table 5.1, at various allocations and the corresponding revenues.  
The total revenue is maximized at the point where the marginal values for the two  
periods are approximately the same \(when \), conforming to our  
intuition; if they were not equal, the firm would reallocate capacity to the higher  
marginal-value period.  
To see qualitatively how prices will change over time, we can write  
the optimality condition \(5.2\) as  
where is the elasticity of demand in period defined by *Dynamic Pricing* 191  
See Section 7.3.1.3 for a further discussion of price elasticity. Thus, more  
elastic demand in period implies a lower optimal price  
For example, if customers that buy toward the end of the sales horizon  
are more price-sensitive than those that buy early, then optimal prices  
will decline over time. If customers early on are price-sensitive, and those  
buying later are less price-sensitive, then optimal prices will increase over  
time. This observation offers one explanation for why in some industries  
\(such as apparel retailing\) prices tend to decline over time, while in  
others \(such as airlines\) prices increase over time. Chapter 8 provides  
additional explanations for intertemporal price patterns.  
**5.2.1.1 Computational Approaches**  
Problem \(5.1\) is a rather simple nonlinear program to solve. Each  
value implies a value by \(5.2\). If the value is too low, these  
demand rates will be too high, and the constraint will  
be violated. If is too high, total demand will not exhaust supply, and  
\(5.3\) will be violated. Of course, if results in a total demand that  
is less than *C,* then this is the optimal dual value. Using these rules, it  
is straightforward to derive a search procedure to find the optimal  
Another computational approach is to apply a greedy allocation algo-  
rithm, based on the observation that the marginal revenues in all periods  
are equal at optimality. Specifically, discretize the capacity *C* into *M*  
units of size each, so that The greedy algorithm then pro-  
ceeds by allocating demand in discrete amounts so as to equalize the  
marginal revenue\:  
**STEP 0 \(Initialize\)\:** Initialize solution ize counter  
**STEP 1 \(Evaluate marginal revenues\)\:** IF  
THEN DO\:  
Increment the demand of this highest marginal revenue period  
Initial-  
ELSE, IF STOP \(Current solution optimal\).  
**STEP 2 \(Check capacity constraint and repeat\)\:** IF  
STOP;  
ELSE and GOTO STEP 1. 192  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
This algorithm takes *O*\( *M* log *T*\) time and is quite simple to program.  
Provided the marginal revenue is decreasing in each period, this greedy  
procedure produces an optimal \(discretized\) solution. \(See Federgruen  
and Groenvelt \[182\].\) The following example illustrates the algorithm\:  
**Example 5.2** Consider a two-period problem with inverse-demand functions  
and The corresponding marginal revenue  
functions are  
There are *C =* 6 units of capacity and we let the increment The algorithm then  
proceeds as shown in Table 5.2. At the start, both periods have the same marginal  
revenue of 10. We break ties arbitrarily by assigning demand to period 1, so we assign  
the first unit to period 1. After this assignment, the marginal revenue in period 1  
drops to 8 while the marginal revenue in period 2 is still 10, so we assign the next  
unit to period 2. The process continues as shown in Table 5.2, assigning units to the  
period with highest marginal revenue until all six units are used up. The algorithm  
terminates with and all six units are allocated and the marginal  
revenues are equalized  
**5.2.1.2 Solution in the Time-Homogenous Case**  
A few additional observations can be made from this model when  
demand is time-homogenous, i.e., for all In this case, the  
optimal price given by is the same in each period. This  
shows that prices fluctuate from period to period in the deterministic  
model \(5.1\) only as a result of changes in the demand function over time.  
The optimal static price will either be the price that causes the supply  
to run out exactly at the end of the horizon \(if \) or the price  
at which the unconstrained revenue is maximized \(if is,  
the revenue-maximizing price\). Specifically, let be defined to be the  
value at which marginal revenue is zero, called the *revenue-*  
*maximizing price.* Let denote the value at which which *Dynamic Pricing* 193  
we call the *stock-clearing price.* Then  
so the optimal solution reduces to using the maximum of the revenue-  
maximizing price and the stock-clearing price. Simply, one cannot do  
better than pricing at at all times. If this price is feasible  
because demand is less than supply. If not, and demand  
at exceeds supply. We then have to raise the price, and is the  
highest price at which we can still manage to sell all *C* units.  
**5.2.1.3 Discrete Prices**  
Often, in practice, we would like to choose prices from a discrete set.  
For example, prices close to convenient whole dollar amounts \(such as  
\$24.99 or \$149.99\), or fixed percentage markdowns \(such as 25% off  
or 50% off\) are often used because they are familiar to customers and  
easy to understand. In such cases, it may be desirable as a matter of  
policy to constrain prices to a finite set of discrete price points, so that  
where Equivalently, the sales rate is  
constrained to a discrete set \(time-varying in this case if  
the demand function is time-varying\), where  
and denotes the sales rate at time when using the price  
The discreteness of the prices imposes technical complications when  
attempting to solve the dynamic pricing problem \(5.1\) because the prob-  
lem is no longer continuous or convex. However, one can overcome this  
difficulty by relaxing the problem to allow the use of convex combinations  
of the discrete prices \(or demand rates\). In most periods, the optimal  
solution will be to use only one of the discrete prices; in the remaining  
periods, the solution has the interpretation of allocating a fraction of  
time to each of several prices.  
To see this, define a vector of new variables for each  
which represent convex weights\: they are nonnegative  
and sum to one. Next, in each period replace the variable with the  
convex combination  
and replace the constraint with the constraint 194  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The optimization problem is then  
where is the revenue rate at price This is a linear  
program in the variables so it is easy to solve numerically.  
To relate the solution to the unconstrained price case, introduce a dual  
variable on the capacity constraint as before. The optimal solution  
in each period is then characterized by solving  
where and are convex weights satisfying the complementary  
slackness condition  
Since the objective function of \(5.5\) is linear in if there is a unique  
index for which is greatest, then the optimal solution  
is simply which corresponds to using the discrete price If  
there is more than one such value then there will be multiple solutions  
to \(5.5\), and determining which is optimal can be resolved by appealing  
to the complementary slackness condition \(5.6\). Of course, such a choice  
could result in a fractional solution in which for two or more  
values However, this can be interpreted as saying that we should use  
the price for a fraction of period Hence, the solution of \(5.4\)  
can be converted in practice into a discrete-price recommendation. The  
following example illustrates the calculation.  
**Example 5.3** Consider a two week selling season in which there is a linear-demand  
function in week 1 and a demand function in  
week 2. The firm is constrained to offer prices in the set \{40, 50, 70\}. The demand and  
revenues are then given in Table 5.3. Solving the linear program \(5.4\) for different  
value of the initial inventory *C,* we obtain the results in Table 5.4. For example, with  
an initial inventory of 50, the solution has and and  
This corresponds to pricing at \$70 for all of week 1 and 36% of week 2 then lowering  
the price to \$50 for the remainder of week 2. Similarly, when the initial inventory is  
70, the solution calls for pricing at \$70 for half of week 1 and then lowering the price  
to \$50 for the remainder of the selling season. At very high levels of inventory \(110  
and 120\), it is optimal to charge a price of \$50 in week 1 and a price of \$40 in week 2. *Dynamic Pricing* 195  
**5.2.1.4 Maximum Concave Envelope**  
In the discrete-price problem, certain discrete prices may never be  
optimal to use and can in fact be eliminated from the problem. Indeed,  
suppose that for a give price there exist convex weights such  
that  
Then the price is never optimal at time Intuitively, this follows since  
a convex combination of other prices produces strictly higher revenue yet  
consumes no more capacity than using This is in fact the same no-  
tion of efficiency described in Section 2.6.2 for the discrete-choice model  
of demand in the single-resource capacity-control problem. All such in-  
efficient prices can be eliminated from consideration at time The  
remaining efficient prices define the *maximum concave envelope* of the  
pairs of values as shown in Figure 5.2.  
**5.2.1.5 Inventory-Depletion Effect**  
Another practical factor affecting dynamic pricing in many retailing  
contexts is the adverse effects of low inventory levels. This is sometimes 196  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
referred to in retailing as a *broken-assortment effect.* For example, if the  
inventory-pricing model is applied at an aggregate item level, where an  
item contains several SKUs—such as color-size combinations in apparel  
retailing—then when inventories run low, certain SKUs may be out of  
stock even though there is a positive inventory for the item as a whole  
\(for example, if a color or size runs out\). The resulting reduction in  
alternatives naturally reduces the sales rate at any given price. Indeed,  
empirical studies have confirmed a positive correlation between inventory  
levels and sales rates \[65\].  
These inventory-depletion effects can be modeled by making the de-  
mand rate a function of inventory as well as of price and time, so that  
the demand rate becomes We can use a variety of func-  
tional forms to represent this inventory-depletion effect. For example,  
one proposed model is the following multiplicative form \[480\]\:  
where is a depletion-effect term. We will call the *unadjusted*  
*sales rate* \(the rate of sales if inventory were unlimited\) and  
the *adjusted sales rate* \(the rate adjusted for inventory-depletion effects\).  
One choice for is  
where is the minimum *full-fixture inventory* and is a  
sensitivity parameter. Both and can be estimated from historical  
data. Note that is concave in *Dynamic Pricing* 197  
Another possible form is  
where and have the same interpretation \(see Smith and Achabal  
\[480\]\).  
For this model with inventory depletion one must keep track of the  
inventory at each time in the optimization problem. For example,  
assuming the multiplicative inventory-depletion model of \(5.8\) and for-  
mulating the problem in terms of the unadjusted sales rate the  
inventory evolves according to the state equation  
and the revenue-maximization problem can be formulated as  
where is the unadjusted revenue-rate function.  
While somewhat more complex than the case without inventory-  
depletions effects, this is still a relatively simple nonlinear program to  
solve because the objective function is separable and the constraints  
are linear. \(The objective function, however, is not necessarily jointly  
concave even if and are both concave.\)  
One qualitative impact of this inventory-depletion phenomenon is  
that optimal prices may decline over time even though the unadjusted  
revenue-rate function is time-invariant. \(Recall that in the problem  
without inventory-depletion effects, a time-invariant revenue-rate func-  
tion implied a time-invariant optimal price.\) For example, Smith and  
Achabal \[480\] show, for the continuous-time version of this model, that  
if the unadjusted revenue-rate function is constant and the inventory-  
depletion effect is multiplicative, then optimal prices decline over time  
in such a way that the adjusted sales rate is constant; that is,  
as inventory depletion reduces demand, the optimal prices fall to exactly  
compensate for the drop in sales due to inventory depletion.  
**5.2.1.6 A Retail Markdown Application**  
Here we look at the study of Heching et al. \[247\] that applied deter-  
ministic pricing models of the sort discussed above to analyze markdown 198  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
pricing at an apparel retailer. The study provides an example of how  
such models can be applied and gives an indication of their potential  
impact.  
The firm studied by Heching et al. \[247\] was a women’s specialty  
apparel retailer with approximately 50 stores in the United States. The  
firm sold primarily its own private-label products and generally stocked  
items once at the beginning of the season. It then used markdowns to  
clear slow-selling merchandize.  
The data set included the majority of the firm’s sales over the spring  
1993 season, spanning 184 styles in 25 groups \(a collection of related  
styles\). Weekly sales were obtained for each style sold during this period.  
Of all the styles in the data set, the firm took markdowns on 60 \(the  
*markdown styles*\)*.* The remaining 124 styles had no price changes. While  
representing only one-third of all styles, markdown styles accounted for  
42% of gross sales revenue.  
There were strong seasonalities in sales due to major holidays and  
traditional shopping seasons as shown in Figure 5.3. Total weekly sales  
ranged from roughly 70% of average in slow weeks to 130% of average *Dynamic Pricing* 199  
in the strongest weeks. The data also indicated that demand was in-  
deed price-sensitive. After adjusting for seasonalities, the conditional  
probability of a sales increase, given a markdown, was 85%, while the  
unconditional probability of an increase was only 38%.  
Sales of nearly all styles also tended to decline over time. Figure 5.4\(i\)  
plots weekly sales for one style that maintained the same price over its  
entire 12-week selling season. The weekly sales figures have been ad-  
justed to eliminate any seasonality that can be attributed to traditional  
shopping seasons. Figure 5.4\(ii\) plots weekly sales for one of the mark-  
down styles. A 28.6% markdown was implemented in week 6. The graph  
indicates a decline in sales over the weeks prior to the price change, as  
well as a decline in sales after the markdown price is implemented. Ex-  
planations for this declining-sales phenomenon include saturation of the  
customer base, loss of customers to competitors, a decline in the per-  
ceived value of an item as the selling season progresses and depletion of  
inventories of individual stock-keeping units.  
The following demand model was used to model these features,  
where is a seasonality factor, is an age factor, and and are  
demand-function parameters. The seasonality factor was estimated from  
aggregate chainwide data. The age factor was estimated at the group  
level, while the demand function coefficients and were estimated  
using regression at the individual-style level. While there were signifi-  
cant errors in the prediction of individual weekly sales using this simple  
model, the average error in total revenues at the style level was only  
1.2%; the error in the total revenue of all 60 markdown styles was only  
0.53%.  
The model was then used to estimate the effects of changes in the  
firm’s markdown policy on the 60 markdown styles. The firm’s mark-  
down policy was compared with the markdowns recommended by a RM  
model that combined a simple online forecasting method with a deter-  
ministic dynamic-pricing model. Each week the demand function was  
reestimated, and an optimal price was computed based on this demand  
estimate. The new price was implemented if it was at least 20% lower  
than the initial price \(a minimum markdown of 20%\). The results are  
shown in Table 5.5. Note that model-based policy marks down only  
33 of the 60 styles and that its average markdown week is much ear-  
lier than the firm’s, though the average markdown is approximately the  
same. The estimated increase in revenue is 4.8%. This gain is due to  
\(1\) a better selection of which styles to markdown and \(2\) taking earlier  
markdowns on the styles that were marked down. 200

**5.2.2 Stochastic Models**  
Next, we look at the case where the price-sensitive demand is stochas-  
tic. We separate the case of continuous-demand models from the case of  
Bernoulli \(discrete Poisson\) demand, though qualitatively the two cases *Dynamic Pricing* 201  
are similar. We assume that the stochastic regularity Assumption 7.6  
\(namely, that the demand has bounded variance\) holds throughout.  
**5.2.2.1 Continuous Demand**  
Here we assume demand in each period is a continuous random vari-  
able of the form discussed in Section 7.3.4 with expectation  
Capacity is continuous as well. Also, we assume  
initially that prices in every period have no constraint other than being  
nonnegative.  
As in the deterministic case, we assume that the demand function  
has an inverse As a result, there is a one-to-one corre-  
spondence between prices and mean demand in each period, so we  
can express the random demand as a function of That is, is  
the demand in period where In this way, we can view  
the mean demand as our decision variable. We require the following  
convexity assumption on the random demand\:  
ASSUMPTION 5.1 *For all the random demand increasing in on the set is convex and*  
*for every value That is,*  
*for all and for all*  
This simply says the demand function is convex in for each real-  
ization of the random-noise term \(Such a random function is called  
strongly stochastically convex; see Appendix B.\) Note that both the  
additive- and the multiplicative-demand models satisfy this convexity  
assumption, as do combinations of the two models.  
We also define the following truncated expected revenue function\:  
This is interpreted as follows. Given a remaining capacity and a price  
in period then is the expected revenue received, since  
what we sell is the minimum of the demand and the capacity  
available We make the following additional assumption\:  
ASSUMPTION 5.2 For *all and for every value both the inverse-*  
*demand function and the random revenue are*  
*concave in on the set*  
While somewhat restrictive, one can show that this assumption holds  
for both the additive- and the multiplicative-demand models provided 202  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
the inverse-demand function and revenue function are con-  
cave, which is true, for example, for the linear- and log-linear-demand  
functions.  
The optimization problem can then be formulated as follows\:  
with boundary conditions are for all and for all  
where we define  
This function is like the value function, in that it gives the expected  
revenue to go in stage as a function of certain state variables—in  
this case, the current inventory and the demand rate decision The  
difference is that it replaces the future inventory state in the value  
function by the two variables that determine  
and  
The following proposition characterizes the properties of the functions  
and  
PROPOSITION 5.1 *If Assumptions 5.1 and 5.2 hold, then for all*  
*\(i\) is jointly concave in and*  
*\(ii\) is concave in and*  
*\(iii\) is increasing in and decreasing in*  
This proposition is proved in Appendix 5.A and has important con-  
sequences for the optimal pricing policy. First, under Assumption 5.2  
is concave in \(it is the minimum of two concave functions\),  
and from Proposition 5.1\(i\) we know that is concave in as well.  
Therefore, a necessary and sufficient condition for an optimal is ob-  
tained by differentiating the term inside the maximization in the dy-  
namic program \(5.11\) and setting the result to zero, which yields  
By Proposition 5.1\(iii\), the right-hand side above is decreasing in and  
since is decreasing in this means that higher inventory  
levels imply a higher optimal sales rate —and  
consequently a lower  
optimal price —inany period That higher inventories lead to lower  
optimal prices is certainly intuitive. *Dynamic Pricing* 203  
**5.2.2.2 Bernoulli Demand**  
If the random demand is Bernoulli \(discrete Poisson\), then a different  
analysis is required. Here we assume there is only one customer per  
period and the customer in period has a willingness to pay that  
is, a random variable with distribution Therefore,  
if the firm offers a price of in period it will sell exactly one unit if  
\(with probability \). Letting denote  
the \(average\) demand rate, we can define an inverse-demand function,  
and revenue-rate function, as  
before. The inventory and demand in this case are both assumed to be  
discrete.  
Letting denote the optimal expected revenue to go, the problem  
can be formulated in terms of demand rates using the Bellman  
equation\:  
with boundary conditions for all and for all  
where is the expected marginal value  
of capacity. Under the monotonicity Assumption 7.2 and assuming an  
interior solution, necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal rate  
are  
which again, as in the deterministic case of equation \(5.2\), has the in-  
terpretation that we set the marginal revenue equal to the marginal  
opportunity cost in every period One can show  
PROPOSITION 5.2 *If Assumption 7.2 holds, then the expected marginal*  
*value of capacity, of the dynamic program \(5.12\) is decreasing*  
*in and is,*  
*\(i\) and \(ii\)*  
Again, this monotonicity has intuitive implications for the optimal  
price. Consider, for simplicity, the case where the marginal revenue is  
not time dependent, so Note that \(5.13\) and  
Assumption 7.2 \(that is decreasing\) together imply that higher  
marginal values correspond to lower optimal-demand rates—and hence  
higher optimal prices. Thus, Proposition 5.2\(i\) above says that with  
more time remaining, the marginal value of capacity increases and there- 204  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
fore the optimal price increases as well.2 Conversely, if time elapses with-  
out any sales taking place, the optimal price will fall. Proposition 5.2\(ii\)  
says the opposite is true of capacity; the more capacity remaining at any  
given point in time, the lower the optimal price. A numerical example  
illustrates this behavior\:  
**Example 5.4** Consider a problem with *T* = 333 time-periods, an initial inventory of  
*C =* 25 units, and a time-homogeneous, exponential-demand function  
in each period with parameters and A sample of the optimal-price  
path is shown in Figure 5.5. The time axis is normalized to one and represents the  
fraction of total time remaining. The points at which the price jumps correspond to  
sales; each sale results in a step increase in price. As time elapses without any sales  
taking place, prices decline. This is exactly the behavior implied by Proposition 5.2.  
**5.2.2.3 Comparing the Deterministic and Stochastic**  
# Models  
One fact that is useful theoretically and computationally is that the  
deterministic model \(5.1\) provides an upper bound on the expected rev-  
enue from the stochastic model \(5.11\). This can be shown in a variety of  
ways. For example, by relaxing the capacity constraint in the stochastic  
2Note this behavior does not necessarily hold if the marginal revenue varies with time, since  
in such cases whether the condition results in rising or falling over  
time for a fixed depends on how both and vary with time. *Dynamic Pricing* 205  
problem with a multiplier we can form the relaxed problem  
where the random variable if there is an arrival in period  
using the control and otherwise. Note an opti-  
mal policy for the original stochastic problem \(5.11\) satisfies  
\(a.s.\); therefore, since if we evaluate the objective  
function of \(5.14\) for such an optimal policy, it will give an upper bound  
on the optimal expected revenue for the original problem \(5.11\). Hence,  
maximizing \(5.14\) over all certainly provides an upper bound as  
well. However, this function is separable in time so we can choose the  
control in each period to maximize at each  
time Since \(5.14\) is equivalent to maximizing  
This is solved as in the deterministic case by setting the marginal rev-  
enue in each period Since this upper bound is valid for  
any we can take the optimal dual price in the deter-  
ministic problem. This results in the optimal solution of  
the deterministic problem. Moreover, by the complementary slackness  
condition \(5.3\), the optimal dual price satisfies  
so the bound \(5.14\) becomes  
which is exactly the optimal deterministic revenue. Hence, the opti-  
mal deterministic revenue is an upper bound on the optimal expected  
stochastic revenue.  
It’s also possible to show that the solution produced by the deter-  
ministic dynamic-pricing problem is a reasonably good heuristic for the  
stochastic-pricing problem. Numerically, it performs well, and theoret-  
ically it can be shown to be asymptotically optimal for problems with  
large demand volumes \(such as a large number of time-periods\) and  
large initial inventories \(see Gallego and van Ryzin \[198\]\). Such proper-  
ties provide support for using deterministic models as an approximation.  
The following example illustrates the deterministic approximation\:  
**Example 5.5** Consider a variation of Example 5.4, where we have *T* = 333 periods  
and a time-homogenous exponential demand function with parameters 206  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and Since the demand function is not time varying, the optimal  
deterministic price is constant. We denote this The unconstrained revenue-  
maximizing price is Starting inventories *C* range from 1 to 20. Table 5.6  
shows the prices and resulting revenues for this problem. As Table 5.6 shows, the  
relative performance of the deterministic heuristic is poorest at *C = 1* \(13% below  
the optimal revenue\) and *C =* 10 \(7.5% below the optimal revenue\) but otherwise  
performs reasonably well, especially in the very unconstrained case of initial inventory  
approaching 20. Note that so *C =* 10 is the boundary between the  
constrained and unconstrained regions of the deterministic problem \(the constrained  
region is where the multiplier and the stock-clearing price is used; the  
unconstrained region is where and the revenue-maximizing price is used\).  
Intuitively, the deterministic prices perform well because they cap-  
ture the correct “first-order” effect. That is, they maximize revenue  
subject to the constraint that the mean demand is within the capacity  
constraint. The stochastic policy does this as well but also adjusts prices  
dynamically to respond to fluctuations about the mean demand. In ad-  
dition, the stochastic policy has a tendency to price higher earlier in  
the sales process \(Figure 5.5\), which reflects the *option value* of keeping  
initial prices high in the event realized demand is stronger than aver-  
age. These two “second-order” adjustments result in the improvement  
in revenue exhibited in Table 5.6. *Dynamic Pricing* 207  
Hence, there are really two separate benefits to dynamic pricing. The  
first is simply to exploit the time-varying price sensitivity of customers;  
if the demand function varies with then even the optimal de-  
terministic price will vary with due to the optimality condition \(5.2\).  
But in addition if demand is stochastic, dynamic pricing helps compen-  
sate for random fluctuations in demand and the option value of holding  
rather than selling units. This is seen in Figure 5.5, where the optimal  
stochastic prices vary despite the fact that the optimal deterministic  
prices for this example are constant. In general, both factors will be  
present in practical problems, but it is useful to distinguish the different  
forces at work in each case.  
**5.2.2.4 Prices Constrained to a Discrete Set**  
Just as in the deterministic case, it may be desirable in practice to  
constrain the prices to a finite set, where  
Equivalently, the sales rate are constrained to a discrete set,  
where as before, de-  
notes the sales rate at time when using the price and  
denotes the corresponding revenue rate. For simplicity, we consider only  
the Bernoulli demand case here \(see Section 7.3.4.3\).  
Computationally, using discrete prices is not a difficult change and in  
fact reduces the complexity of the dynamic program \(5.12\) because the  
search at each stage is now reduced to a finite set of prices. As in the  
deterministic case, the finite set of prices can be further reduced to only  
those prices defining the maximum concave envelope \(the efficient prices\)  
by using the efficiency criteria \(5.7\). The reasoning is identical to the  
deterministic case; inefficient prices produce less expected revenue and  
have a higher probability of consuming capacity than done by efficient  
prices \(or mixtures of efficient prices\) and therefore are never an optimal  
choice.  
Theoretically, the analysis of the discrete problem can again be re-  
laxed to put it in a form similar to the unconstrained price case by  
allowing the firm to randomize over the discrete set of prices. As in  
the deterministic case, define new variables that represent convex  
weights, and in each period replace the variable in \(5.12\) with the  
convex combination 208  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and replace the constraint with the constraint  
The dynamic program then becomes  
with the usual boundary conditions and for  
all In the stochastic case, a fractional solution can be directly  
interpreted as a randomization of the prices in Also,  
one can eliminate inefficient prices using the maximum concave envelope  
as in the deterministic case.  
We can put this in a form similar to \(5.12\) by noting there is a corre-  
spondence between the optimal choice of and the optimal value of  
since for any fixed sales rate the optimal  
that achieves this sales rate must maximize the expected revenue—that  
is, it solves the linear program  
The resulting mulated as  
in fact will define the maximum concave envelope  
of the fixed set of prices. Hence, the optimization problem can be for-  
which has exactly the same form as \(5.12\) except that the maximum  
concave envelope function though continuous and concave, is no  
longer differentiable. \(Like all objective functions of a maximization lin-  
ear program, is a concave and piecewise linear function of the  
right-hand side \) Thus, the optimality condition \(5.13\) must be re-  
placed by *Dynamic Pricing* 209  
where denotes the set of subgradients \(the subdifferential\)  
of at the value \(See Appendix C for a definition and  
discussion of subgradients and nondifferentiable optimization.\)  
Practically speaking, the above condition implies that the optimal  
will most often be at a corner point of the function \(or there will  
be multiple optimal solutions along an interval containing two adjacent  
corner points\) and we can always find one of the fixed prices that is op-  
timal without randomizing. However, by formulating the problem this  
way, we preserve the concavity of Therefore, the structure of the  
optimal solution to \(5.15\) is the same as that of \(5.12\), and Proposi-  
tion 5.1 continues to hold for this case.  
**5.3 Single-Product Dynamic Pricing with**  
# Replenishment  
We next consider situations in which inventory can be replenished  
at a cost in each period, as in many production and supply-chain-  
management contexts. In such cases, both pricing and inventory de-  
cisions need to be made; pricing decisions are used to control demand,  
while replenishment decisions are used to control supply. The central  
problem is to optimally coordinate these demand and supply decisions.  
As in the finite-supply case, we first look at deterministic models of  
this problem and then examine stochastic models.  
**5.3.1 Deterministic Models**  
We assume a single good with an end-of-period inventory, denoted  
that can be replenished over time. There is a per-unit holding cost  
for inventory in period and a unit cost for replenishment We let  
denote the amount ordered in period As in the finite-supply case,  
we can formulate the problem in terms of the sales rate in which  
case we let and denote, respectively, the revenue rate  
and marginal revenue as before. Again, we assume that these functions  
satisfy the regularity conditions in Assumptions 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 unless  
otherwise specified.  
**5.3.1.1 Unconstrained Capacity**  
We first consider the case where is no capacity constraint on the  
amount ordered in each period. The problem can be formulated as  
finding a set of rates and reorder quantities that solve 210  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where we assume the initial inventory for simplicity.  
The problem as stated above is not difficult to solve. Indeed, for  
define the coefficients  
and note that from period Let  
is the cost of satisfying demand in period with supply  
denote the lowest cost for supplying period and let denote an  
index that achieves the minimum on the right-hand side above.  
The optimal sales rate in any period is then determined by  
equating the marginal revenue to this lowest marginal cost,  
And the optimal quantity to order in period adding up the sales rates from later periods is from period  
is simply determined by  
whose lowest-cost supply  
An interesting observation for this problem is that even if the demand  
functions are time-invariant for all \), the optimal price  
can still vary over time due to changes in the cost of supply. In other  
words, because the optimality conditions equate marginal revenue to  
marginal cost, changes in the costs over time will  
lead to time-varying prices, even though the marginal revenue function  
is time-invariant.  
**5.3.1.2 Capacity Constraints on Ordering**  
The problem becomes somewhat more complex when there are capac-  
ity constraints on the order quantities of the form  
Such constraints, for example, could be due to limited production, trans-  
portation, or handling capacity. While \(5.17\) can be solved as a non-  
linear program with these added capacity constraints, there is a simpler  
approach. If one discretizes the sales quantities, we can solve the prob-  
lem using a greedy algorithm under the assumption that the marginal *Dynamic Pricing* 211  
revenue in each period is decreasing. \(See Chann, Simchi-Levi, and  
Swann \[105\] for a proof.\)  
The greedy algorithm proceeds as follows. For a fixed vector of rates  
define  
where is the minimum cost for meeting the sales rates **d**, defined by  
fixing **d** and solving the following optimization problem in the variables  
Thus, is the optimal profit given the demand rates **d**. Computing  
is efficient because the minimization problem to determine  
\(5.19\), is simply a minimum-cost network-flow problem.  
For notational convenience, let denote the unit vector \(the vector  
with a 1 in the component and a zero in all other components\), and  
let denote the discretization increment \(all components of the vector  
are assumed to be integral multiples of  
The greedy algorithm is as follows.  
**STEP 0 \(Initialize\)\:** Initialize solution  
Calculate using \(5.18\).  
**STEP 1 \(Compute marginal values\)\:** FOR DO\:  
Compute from \(5.18\).  
**STEP 2 \(Find largest marginal increase\)\:** Chose the index which the marginal gain is largest.  
IF STOP \(optimal solution found\);  
ELSE, update **d\:**  
and GOTO STEP 1.  
for 212  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
In words, at each stage the algorithm simply adds an increment of  
demand to the period that yields the largest net gain  
and stops when no period produces a positive net gain. Biller et al. \[67\]  
report a test of this model and algorithm on data from the automobile  
industry.  
**5.3.2 Stochastic Models**  
A stochastic version of the dynamic-pricing problem with replenish-  
ment can also be formulated as follows\: As in Section 5.2.2, let  
denote the inventory at the end of period and *T* be the number of  
periods in the horizon. \(We consider an infinite-horizon, stationary ver-  
sion of the problem in Section 5.3.2.2.\) Because demand is random, it is  
possible that demand in a period can exceed the available inventory. In  
such cases, we assume that the firm can back-order demand, and this is  
represented by a negative inventory  
As before, we represent demand in each period as a random vari-  
able of the form discussed in Section 7.3.4, with expectation  
with a unique inverse We assume that the  
quantities and demand are continuous. Also, we assume that prices in  
every period are unconstrained \(with the only requirement\). Fi-  
nally, we assume that the demand satisfies the regularity con-  
dition in Assumption 7.6 and the convexity condition in Assumption 5.1.  
The random revenue in each period is  
The inventory after ordering is denoted and hence the quantity  
ordered is For notational convenience, we use as the  
quantity-decision variable. We assume that we cannot dispose of items,  
so  
There is a per-unit ordering cost in period and a convex cost  
on the ending inventory in period This cost typically will  
penalize both positive inventories \(due to capital costs, storage costs,  
and so on\), and negative inventories \(due to lost goodwill or penalties  
for late delivery\). For example, a function of the form  
is commonly used, where cost of holding a unit, and is the  
is the penalty cost for back-ordering a unit.  
**5.3.2.1 Finite-Horizon Problem**  
In the multi-period case, the optimization problem can then be for-  
mulated as follows\: *Dynamic Pricing* 213  
where we define  
Using arguments that are essentially the same as those in Proposi-  
tion 5.1, one can show the following\:  
PROPOSITION 5.3 *\(i\) is jointly concave in and*  
*\(ii\) is concave in*  
*\(iii\) is increasing in*  
*\(iv\) is increasing in*  
Proposition \(5.3\) \(iii\) and \(iv\) imply that is a *supermodular func-*  
*tion.* \(See Appendix C for a definition of the supermodularity property.\)  
These properties allow us to characterize the optimal pricing and order-  
ing policy.  
Specifically, let and denote the values that maximize \(5.20\)  
without the constraint that is, they solve  
Further, for simplicity assume an interior optimal solution for and  
so that, by joint concavity of the necessary and sufficient conditions  
for and are then  
\(If there are two or more sets of values satisfying these conditions, take  
the pair that is lexicographically the largest.\)  
It follows, then, that if the optimal policy in period is to  
order up to and set the demand rate at \(that is,  
and since the unconstrained optimal solution  
is feasible. However, if then one can show that it is optimal to  
order nothing \(for example, set and choose a demand rate that  
is higher than Equivalently, set the price lower than  
Moreover, the higher the inventory the higher the optimal rate  
\(equivalently, the lower the optimal price 3 The resulting policy  
3To see this, we can argue informally as follows. Suppose that the optimal and satisfy  
and Then since the constraint is not binding, these values 214 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
is called a *base-stock, posted-price policy.* If inventory is less than the  
*base-stock* level then order up to this level, and price at the *posted*  
*price* If inventory exceeds the optimal base-stock level  
then order nothing, and discount the price below the posted price, with  
the discount being larger the more the inventory exceeds the optimal  
base-stock level.  
**5.3.2.2 Infinite-Horizon, Stationary Problem**  
One can also extend this same analysis to an infinite-horizon setting.  
We assume that all the parameters of the problem are time-invariant  
and profits are discounted by a factor in each period.4  
The value function in this case is also time-homogenous. The formu-  
lation is  
where  
In this infinite-horizon case, one can show that a time-invariant, base-  
stock, posted-price policy is optimal. That is, there exist values  
and such that if it is optimal to order up to and price at  
If we order nothing, and the optimal demand rate  
is greater than and increasing in Note that in this infinite-horizon  
case, once we reach a point where then in all remaining periods  
we simply price at the posted price and order up to In other words,  
we use dynamic pricing only to clear inventory that is higher than the  
optimal base stock However, since such high inventory levels are only  
transient, in the long run, the policy ends up using a constant price.  
must satisfy the first-order condition,  
But this contradicts the fact the are the lexicographically largest pair of values  
satisfying the first-order conditions. Therefore, we must have and  
Since the fact that is increasing in now follows from the fact that  
that is decreasing in and that is decreasing in  
See Federgruen and Heching \[183\] for a complete proof of these properties.  
4Similar results hold for the case of the average profit criteria by considering the discounted  
problem with See Federgruen and Heching \[183\]. *Dynamic Pricing* 215  
**5.3.2.3 Fixed Costs**  
Another variation of the problem is to include a fixed cost for ordering.  
The finite-horizon version of this problem was studied by Chen and  
Simchi-Levi \[113\]. In this case, the cost function becomes  
This results in a significantly more complex value function. However,  
one can show, in certain cases, that properties of the optimal policy are  
similar to those of classical inventory theory. For example, when the  
demand function has additive uncertainty, then the optimal ordering  
policy is of the form, wherein we order only in period if the  
inventory drops below and in this case we order enough to restore  
the inventory to the target level \(order an amount However,  
this property does not hold for other stochastic-demand functions.5  
Moreover, the optimal state-dependent price is quite a bit more com-  
plex. For example, Chen and Simchi-Levi \[113\] show that, as a function  
of the current inventory, the optimal price may not be decreasing in the  
inventory level between ordering epochs. This is because while there is  
an incentive to decrease price to reduce inventory, there is also an in-  
centive to increase price to delay reordering and postpone incurring the  
fixed-ordering cost.  
**5.4 Multiproduct, Multiresource Pricing**  
Multiproduct, multiresource—or network—versions of dynamic pric-  
ing problems arise in many applications. Two fundamental factors typi-  
cally link the pricing decisions for multiple products. First, demand for  
products may be correlated. For example, when products are substitutes  
or complements, the price charged for one product effects the demand for  
other related products. Then, a firm jointly managing the pricing of a  
family of such products must consider these cross-elasticity effects when  
determining its optimal pricing policy. Second, products may be linked  
by joint capacity constraints. For example, two products may require  
the same resource, which is available in limited supply. Even if there are  
no cross-elasticity effects between the two products, the pricing decision  
for one product will need to account for the joint effect on demand for  
the other product that uses the limited resource.  
As in the case of capacity controls, most problems in real life are mul-  
tiproduct problems, either because of cross-elasticity effects or because  
policy does hold more generally, however;  
5A somewhat more complex variant of this see Chen and Simchi-Levi \[113\]. 216 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
of joint capacity constraints, or both. For example, a grocery store that  
is pricing brands in a food category—say, salty snacks—needs to con-  
sider the cross-elasticity effects of its pricing decision for all products in  
the category. An increase in the price of a packet of potato chips will not  
just cause a drop in demand for potato chips but will likely also increase  
the demand for corn chips. At the same time, these products may oc-  
cupy the same limited shelf space, so stocking more of one product may  
require stocking less \(or none\) of other products.  
We can model such situations using multiproduct-demand functions  
and joint capacity constraints on resources. However, like the network  
problems of capacity control, such formulations quickly become difficult  
to analyze and solve, which is the reason that many commercial appli-  
cations of dynamic-pricing models make the simplifying assumption of  
unrelated products and independent demands and solve a collection of  
single-product models as an approximation.  
Yet in cases where cross-elasticity or resource-constraint effects are  
strong—for example, when products are only slightly differentiated, cus-  
tomers are very price-sensitive, or joint capacity constraints are tight—  
then ignoring multiproduct effects can be severely suboptimal. In such  
cases, we must solve a pricing problem incorporating these effects—or  
at least approximating them in some fashion. In this section, we look as  
such multiproduct, multiresource models and methods.  
**5.4.1 Deterministic Models Without**  
# Replenishment  
Under a deterministic-demand assumption, it is relatively straight-  
forward to formulate a multiproduct, multiresource version of dynamic  
pricing similar to those described in Section 5.2. There are prod-  
ucts, indexed by and resources, indexed by There is a horizon  
of *T* periods, with each period indexed by As in Section 7.3.2, let  
denote the demand rate for the products and  
denote the inverse-demand function in period We further assume  
that the revenue-rate function satisfies the regularity conditions  
of Assumption 7.4.  
Product uses a quantity of resource The matrix  
therefore describes the *bill of materials* for all products. We assume  
there are limited capacities of the resources.  
The dynamic-pricing problem can then be formulated as finding a  
sequence of demand vectors that maximizes the firm’s total revenue *Dynamic Pricing* 217  
subject to the capacity constraints *C*\:  
By Assumption 7.4, is concave in **d**, and therefore, the following  
Kuhn-Tucker conditions are necessary and sufficient for characterizing  
an optimal solution to \(5.21\)\:  
where is the marginal-value vector and is the op-  
timal dual price on the joint-capacity constraints, having the usual inter-  
pretation as the vector of marginal opportunity costs \(marginal values\)  
for the resources. Condition \(5.22a\) says that at the optimal sales  
rate, the marginal revenue for each product should equal the marginal  
opportunity cost of the resources used by product or Con-  
dition \(5.22b\) says that the marginal opportunity cost of resource can  
be positive only if the corresponding capacity constraint for resource  
is binding. Finally, \(5.22c\) requires that the marginal opportunity costs  
be nonnegative.  
The nonlinear program \(5.21\) is relatively easy to solve numerically,  
since the objective function is concave and the constraints are linear.  
\(See Bertsekas \[58, 59\] for specific techniques.\)  
**Example 5.6** Consider the six-node airline network shown in Figure 5.6. Nodes 2  
and 3 are “hub” nodes. \(Leg seat capacities are as indicated in the figure.\) For a  
given path on the network, the revenue function is time homogeneous and log-linear  
where is interpreted as a reference price for itinerary is the demand rate at the  
reference price, and is the magnitude of the elasticity of demand at the reference  
price. Demand-function parameters for all O-D pairs are shown in Table 5.7 along  
with the path \(itinerary\) used by each O-D pair.  
Because the demand functions are time-homogeneous, optimal prices are constant  
over time. The optimal O-D prices and demand are shown in the last two columns in  
Table 5.7. The solution gives a total revenue of \$661, 200 across all O-D pairs. 218 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**5.4.2 Deterministic Models with Replenishment**  
We can formulate deterministic multiproduct models with replenish-  
ment, analogous to those in Section 5.3 as follows\:  
where is an of inventory levels at the end of period  
is an of order quantities in period is a vector of holding  
costs, is a vector of ordering costs, and is a vector of capacity  
constraints on the order quantities.  
The introduction of an inventory-state variable makes this a more dif-  
ficult problem to solve. However, in certain specialized cases the greedy  
allocation algorithm of the type described in Section 5.3.1.2 can be used  
to solve it exactly. \(See Swann \[497\] for details.\) This greedy algorithm  
can also be used as a heuristic in more general cases. *Dynamic Pricing* 219  
**5.4.3 Stochastic Models**  
Stochastic multiproduct pricing problems, like stochastic multiprod-  
uct capacity-allocation problems, are quite difficult to solve exactly.  
While in principle they can be formulated as dynamic programs, the  
size of the state space is often prohibitively large. Therefore, approxi-  
mations offer the only practical hope to solve such problems.  
One natural approach for a stochastic multiproduct problem is to  
approximate it by its deterministic equivalent problem, which as we’ve  
seen in Section 5.2.2.3 are reasonably easy to solve. As in the case  
of the single-product problem discussed in Section 5.2.2.3, one can in-  
deed show that deterministic solutions are asymptotically optimal \(in  
the same fluid scaling of the problem\) in certain cases. That is, sup-  
pose the revenue in period is random and we consider a  
deterministic problem that replaces this random demand by its mean,  
Then the optimal deterministic price trajectory  
from the resulting deterministic problem, when applied as an open-loop  
control for the stochastic problem, produces an expected revenue that is  
provably close to the optimal stochastic expected revenue.  
For example, Gallego and van Ryzin \[199\] show that for a continu-  
ous time version of the multiproduct pricing problem of Section 5.4.1 220 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
with Poisson uncertainty, the solution to the equivalent deterministic  
problem is asymptotically optimal for the stochastic problem as the ca-  
pacities and time horizon are scaled up proportionally. The arguments  
and formal definition of the scaling are similar to the asymptotic analysis  
of network capacity control problems presented in Section 3.6.2 and 3.6  
and are omitted. However, the result does provide some intuition into  
the connection between these two problems.  
**5.4.4 Action-Space Reductions**  
One simplification that is useful for multiproduct dynamic pricing  
problems is to express the problem in terms of resource-consumption  
rates rather than the demand rates **d**. This yields an equivalent for-  
mulation with often a greatly reduced dimensionality that can be much  
easier to solve. The approach is due to Maglaras and Meissner \[354\].  
To illustrate the main idea, consider the case of the deterministic  
model \(5.21\) where there is only resource but products.  
For example, this could be a situation similar to the traditional single-  
resource problem of Chapter 2 but one in which we control the demand  
for each product by adjusting its price The deterministic  
problem \(5.21\) in this case is then  
To reduce the dimensionality of this problem, we express the problem in  
terms of the aggregate-demand rate rather than the individual demand  
rates **d**. To this end, define the aggregate-demand rate  
and for a given define the maximized revenue-rate function by *Dynamic Pricing* 221  
That is, is the instantaneous maximum revenue rate given that  
the total demand rate \(equivalently, the resource *consumption rate*\) is  
constrained to be It is easy to show that if is jointly concave  
in **d**, then will be concave in  
Using these new variables, we can then formulate \(5.24\) as  
Note that this is now a problem that is equivalent to a single-product  
pricing problem of the same form as \(5.1\) with a scalar demand rate  
and revenue-rate functions Once we solve for the optimal demand  
rates we can then convert these into optimal vectors of demand  
rates by inserting into the optimization problem \(5.25\). Thus,  
the solution proceeds in two steps\: first solve \(5.26\) to determine the  
optimal aggregate sales rate, and then solve \(5.25\) at each time to  
disaggregate this optimal aggregate rate into a optimal vector of sales  
rates \(equivalently prices\) for each product.  
This same action-space-reduction approach also works for stochastic  
versions of this problem, of the types examined in Section 5.2.2. To illus-  
trate, consider the dynamic program \(5.11\) for the continuous, additive-  
uncertainty-demand model, but now suppose there are products. The  
version of \(5.11\) yields the dynamic program  
where rate is the random demand for product  
To reduce the action space, we again define the aggregate-demand  
and a maximized expected revenue rate using \(5.25\),  
where now Also, let  
denote the aggregate noise term and 222 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
denote the aggregate \(random\) demand. When these transformed vari-  
ables are substituted into the dynamic program \(5.27\), it reduces to the  
following equivalent single-product formulation  
where  
This has the same form as the single-product DP \(5.11\). Thus, the  
single-resource, dynamic-pricing problem is really no more  
difficult to solve than the single-product problem.  
This action-space reduction idea also extends to the general multi-  
product multiresource problem \(5.21\) *as* well. In this case,  
one can show that the problem can be reduced to one with only de-  
mand rates \(one for each resource\) rather than the original rates \(one  
for each product\). Namely, let define the maximized  
revenue rate at each time  
This maximized revenue-rate function and the new demand-rate vari-  
ables are then used to reformulate the general problem \(5.21\) as  
What these reductions show, in essence, is that the complexity of the  
multiproduct, multiresource dynamic-pricing problem is caused not by  
the number of products but by the number of resources since  
ultimately determines the dimensionality of both the state and action  
spaces. *Dynamic Pricing* 223  
**5.5 Finite-Population Models and Price**  
# Skimming  
We next consider what effect a finite-population assumption has on an  
optimal dynamic-pricing policy.6 Recall that a finite-population model  
assumes that we sample customers without replacement from a finite  
number of potential customers. Thus, the history of demand \(how many  
customers have purchased, how much they paid, and so on\) affects the  
distribution of both the number and valuations of the remaining cus-  
tomers.  
Because the finite-population assumption is more complex, we focus  
on deterministic models of this situation. However, we consider both a  
myopic and strategic customer version of the problem.  
**5.5.1 Myopic Customers**  
Recall that a myopic customer is assumed to purchase the first time  
the current price drops below his valuation Combined with the  
finite-population assumption, this behavior can be exploited by the firm  
to achieve *price skimming*—a version of classical second-degree price  
discrimination.  
Assume for simplicity that there is a finite population size *N* and  
that customers in this population have valuations *v* that are uniformly  
distributed on the interval As an approximation, we assume that  
sales can occur in fractions, so the population can be regarded as con-  
tinuous. The important point to note is that the fraction of customers  
who purchased until time leave the population of customers for the  
remaining sale period.  
As a result of the myopic-customer assumption, if the firm offers a  
price customers will buy. And by the finite-population  
assumption, there will then be remaining customers, with valua-  
tions uniformly distributed on the interval  
Now, consider a firm that sells a fixed capacity *C* of a product to this  
population over *T* time-periods. The firm is free to set different prices  
in each period. What is the optimal pricing strategy?  
First, it is not hard to see that the optimal prices are decreasing over  
time, since \(by the myopic-customer assumption\) the only customers  
left at time are those with values less than the minimum price offered  
in periods \(See Section 8.3 for further motivations for a  
6Section 8.3.4 covers the economic aspects of a durable-goods monopolist under a finite-  
population, strategic-customer assumption. Here we concentrate on more operational results  
of dynamic pricing. 224 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
firm setting a decreasing schedule of prices.\) Hence, the firm will sell  
nothing if it posts a price in period that is higher than the minimum  
price offered in the past. This observation, applied inductively, shows  
that the optimal prices must decline over time. Moreover, note that if  
for all the revenue generated in period is given by  
where we define This is because is the  
number of customers with valuations greater than but less than the  
lowest previous price  
To see the effect the decreasing price schedule has on the optimal pric-  
ing policy, assume for simplicity that *C \> N*, so the capacity constraint  
is never binding. In this case, the firm must solve  
Note that the objective function is jointly concave in  
It is not hard to see that the constraints \(5.28b\) are redundant, since the  
objective function \(5.28a\) will penalize the use of a price  
Therefore, ignoring constraints \(5.28b\) and defining  
the first-order conditions imply the optimal unconstrained solution must  
satisfy  
One can easily verify that the solution  
satisfies these first-order conditions. Since the optimization problem  
\(5.28a–d\) is strictly concave and \(5.29\) satisfies the inequality constraints  
for all it is in fact the unique optimal solution for  
\(5.28a–d\). This solution is illustrated in Figure 5.7\(i\).  
The optimal pricing strategy effectively exploits the myopic behavior  
of customers to segment them into *T+*1 groups based on their valuations,  
and then price discriminates based on this segmentation. Specifically,  
as shown in Figure 5.7, segment consists of those customer whose *Dynamic Pricing* 225  
valuations are in the range and these segments pay a  
declining price given by \(5.29\). Segment *T* + 1 has values in the  
range and is not served at all.  
There are several interesting observations about this solution. First,  
note we can write the optimal price in period as  
The first term on the right, is simply the single-period  
revenue-maximizing price, which follows from the fact that the remaining  
customers in period have values uniformly distributed on  
Therefore, the optimal price in period is higher than the single-period  
revenue-maximizing price for period \(except in the last period  
where they are equal\). Intuitively, this occurs because there is an addi-  
tional benefit to the firm of raising its price in period in the multiperiod  
setting; namely, it will have more customers to sell to in the future.  
Second, note the price changes over time not because the distribution  
of valuations changes over time—as in the infinite-population model of  
demand—but because the firm seeks to price discriminate among the  
finite population of customers. For example, in an equivalent infinite-  
population model \(essentially, the model of Section 5.2.1 with a linear-  
demand function\), the distribution of values of customers is unaffected  
by past demand, and hence the distribution would still be uniform over  
in each period. In this case, the optimal price to charge in each  
period would be a constant rather than the declining price \(5.29\).  
Therefore, a finite population of customers creates an incentive to offer  
dynamically decreasing prices to achieve price discrimination, an incen-  
tive that is not present in infinite-population models. 226 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Finally, note that if the number of periods *T* increases, the firm’s  
revenues increase because one can show \(after some algebra\) that the  
optimal total revenue for T periods is  
Indeed, as *T* tends to infinity, the firm achieves perfect price discrimina-  
tion and captures the entire consumer surplus each  
customer ends up paying a price arbitrarily close to his valuation. In  
particular, a continuous-time model of this problem can achieve perfect  
price discrimination because the firm can continuously lower prices from  
down to zero over the interval \[0, *T*\]*.* A number of customers  
with values will buy when the price is so the firm achieves  
a revenue of which is the entire consumer surplus.  
The introduction of a binding capacity constraint does little to change  
this basic story. Indeed, the solution \(5.29\) will not be feasible if *C \<*  
*NT / \(T +*1\)*.* However, in this case, one can show that the optimal price  
is simply modified so that only those customers above a lower limit  
are segmented, where  
The optimal price in this case becomes  
and customers with valuations less than served. This solution is illustrated in Figure 5.7\(ii\).  
are not  
**5.5.2 Strategic Customers**  
One might question why customers would behave myopically when  
faced with a price-skimming strategy. Indeed, knowing that prices will  
decline over time, rational customers could do better \(increase their net  
utility\) by deviating from myopic behavior and delaying purchase until  
the price is much lower than their valuation. Such behavior is quite  
plausible and is a valid criticism of the myopic-customer model, but it  
complicates the analysis of the firm’s optimal-pricing policy considerably.  
Most significantly, it turns the pricing problem into a game between the  
firm and its customers, in which we must analyze the equilibrium using  
game-theoretic tools.  
Strategic customer behavior is, in fact, a central feature of the the-  
ory of optimal mechanism design discussed in Chapter 6 on auctions. *Dynamic Pricing* 227  
Both auction and list-price mechanisms are analyzed in Chapter 6, and  
we provide much of the analysis and insight about pricing with strate-  
gic customer behavior there \(see also Section 8.3.4\). Here we focus on  
the more limited topic of the effect of strategic customers on the price-  
skimming strategy alone. Further, to keep things simple, throughout  
this section we consider only the case where the firm has no capacity  
constraint \(*C \> N*\).  
To proceed, one first has to make assumptions about whether the firm  
can credibly commit to a schedule of prices over time or whether the firm  
must follow a subgame-perfect equilibrium-pricing strategy. \(See Appen-  
dix F for a discussion of subgame perfection.\) In our case, requiring a  
subgame-perfect equilibrium means that the strategy for the firm at each  
time has to be an equilibrium for the residual revenue-maximization  
game over the horizon given whatever state the firm and  
customers were in period  
For example, if the firm can commit to a price schedule, then a rational  
customer will simply look at the schedule of prices and \(assuming no dis-  
counting of utility\) decide to purchase in the period with the lowest price,  
and only customers with valuations above this lowest price will decide to  
purchase. So effectively, it is only the lowest price among the *T* periods  
that matters to customers. Given this fact \(and ignoring capacity con-  
straints\), the firm will then set this minimum price as the single-period  
revenue-maximizing price, which, in the case where customer valuations  
are uniformly distributed on is just The firm will then set  
arbitrary but higher prices in the other periods. Which period the firm  
chooses for the minimum price doesn’t matter unless revenues are dis-  
counted, in which case the firm would prefer collecting revenues sooner  
rather than later and would choose period 1. The total revenue the firm  
receives is then which is just the product of the price and the  
number of customers willing to pay that price, One can formalize  
this reasoning and show that this is indeed the equilibrium strategy in  
the case where the firm has to commit to a price schedule.  
Note that the fact that customers are rational has eliminated the  
ability of the firm to price discriminate; the firm is forced to offer a  
single uniform price to all customers. Moreover, the firm’s revenue is  
strictly worse under this model. This is to be expected, the firm ought  
to do worse when customers are “smarter.”  
However, the single-period strategy outlined above is not always  
subgame-perfect. To see why, suppose this lowest price occurs in  
period 1. Then in period 2, there will be a population of customers  
with values less than who have not purchased. If the firm has any  
remaining supply after period it would rather sell the remaining stock 228 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
at some positive price than let it go unsold. Thus, it has an incentive to  
lower the price in period 2 to capture some of the remaining customers.  
However, rational customers realize the firm faces this temptation after  
period 1 and, anticipating the price drop, do not purchase in period  
1, so offering the lowest price in period 1 cannot be a subgame-perfect  
equilibrium.  
Besanko and Winston \[47\] analyze the subgame-perfect pricing strat-  
egy. The equilibrium is for the firm to lower prices over time, similar to  
the price-skimming strategy of Section 5.5.1. In the case where revenues  
are not discounted, this equilibrium results in the firm setting a declin-  
ing sequence of prices, where the price in the last period *T* is simply  
the single-period optimal price all customers buy only in the last  
period. This case is essentially equivalent to the case where the firm can  
commit to a schedule of prices, with the exception that the firm is forced  
to offer the lowest price only in the last period.  
The situation is somewhat more interesting if revenues and customer  
utility are discounted at the same rate. In this case, the subgame-perfect  
equilibrium has customers with high values buying in the early periods  
and those with lower values buying in later periods, again, as in the price  
skimming case of Section 5.5.1. However, unlike the price-skimming  
case, the equilibrium price in each period is *lower* than the single-period  
revenue-maximizing price for the customers remaining in that period.  
In particular, in period 1 the equilibrium price is less than and  
the equilibrium price declines in subsequent periods. Thus, the firm is  
strictly worse off than when it can commit to a price schedule. This is  
because when the firm can commit to its price schedule, it can force all  
customers to purchase in period 1 by simply offering very high prices  
in periods while setting a price of exactly in period 1. All  
customers will then buy in period 1 at a price of  
Besanko and Winston \[47\] show that with strategic customers, the  
firm is always better off with fewer periods; that is, the firm’s equilib-  
rium revenue is decreasing in the number of periods. This is because the  
inability of the firm to commit to prices in later periods hurts it, and  
the more periods, the more often the firm falls victim to the temptation  
to lower prices. That is, it discounts early and often. This is to be con-  
trasted with the case of myopic customers, where the firm’s revenues are  
increasing in the number of periods. Thus, although the strategy looks  
like price skimming, rational customers create a qualitatively different  
situation for the firm than do myopic customers. *Dynamic Pricing* 229  
**5.6 Promotions Optimization**  
In this section we look at normative models for retail and trade pro-  
motions. We first discuss promotions in general and how they differ from  
the sorts of dynamic-pricing problems considered thus far. We then look  
at two specific models of promotion optimization.  
**5.6.1 An Overview of Promotions**  
As mentioned in this chapter’s introduction, promotions are short-run,  
temporary price changes that are frequently applied to replenishable  
and consumable goods \(such as CPG products\). Promotions are run  
either by the manufacturer \(trade promotions\) or by retailers \(retail  
promotions or consumer promotions\). Manufacturer may also give a  
discount directly to the end customer in the form of coupons and rebates.  
While manufacturers are interested in increasing sales or profits for their  
brand, retailers are interested in overall sales or profits for an entire  
product category.  
A promotion generally increases sales to both the retailer and manu-  
facturer, but there are a variety of factors at work behind the increase.  
Customers may increase their consumption of the product due to two  
fundamental effects\: higher household inventories lead to fewer stock-  
outs and therefore an increase in consumption; and higher inventories  
give customers greater flexibility in consuming the product because they  
don’t have to worry about replacing the inventory at higher prices. For  
instance, Wansink and Deshpande \[553\] and Chandon and Wansink \[104\]  
show that larger household inventory causes faster usage rates if product-  
usage occasions are flexible \(snack foods\), products need refrigeration,  
or products occupy a prominent place in the pantry \(for empirical evi-  
dence of this based on scanner data, see Ailawadi and Neslin \[5\]\). Some  
other reasons promotions cause an increase in demand include customers  
switching from nondiscounted brands to the discounted brands and cus-  
tomers \(or retailers for trade deals\) stockpiling to take advantage of the  
low price \(forward buying\).  
Not surprisingly a dominating factor behind the demand increase is  
the type of product. For example, products such as yogurt and potato  
chips tend to see an increase because of increased consumption, while  
for products such as tomato ketchup, diapers, and toilet paper, the sales  
increase is primarily because of brand switching or stockpiling.  
Promotions, in the framework of RM, can be thought of as either  
\(1\) a manufacturer using price to dispose excess inventory, \(2\) a man-  
ufacturer trying to gain market share to induce customers to try out  
its products, \(3\) retailers experimenting with price to find optimal price 230 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
points, \(4\) separating price-sensitive customers, who are willing to use  
coupons or who wait for deals, \(5\) retailers trying to increase store traffic,  
as customers once inside the store are likely to purchase other, nonpro-  
motional items, or \(6\) a tactic for store brands or small firms to compete  
against the large advertising budgets of the established brands.  
**5.6.1.1 Types of Promotions**  
As mentioned, the main dichotomy in promotions is between retail  
promotions and trade promotions. Many promotional events are in fact  
closely coordinated between the manufacturer and the retailer. For in-  
stance, if the retailer runs an advertised promotion, the manufacturer  
may agree to bear a share of the advertising cost, or the trade deal may  
involve running an in-store display supplied by the manufacturer.  
Retail promotions can be advertised or unadvertised \(in-store promo-  
tions\), often coordinated with temporary in-store displays. The price  
promotion part may take the form of a simple percentage off, coupons,  
or a “multibuy” \(discount for multiple items packaged together\), or an  
extra free \(such as three for the price of two; or 15% more free\). The  
latter two types are usually manufacturer-driven, as packaging may have  
to be changed.  
Trade promotions traditionally are in the form of *off-invoice* as a per-  
centage off the amount ordered during the promotion period. Surpris-  
ingly, many off-invoice promotions do not require the retailers pass the  
discount on to the customer, so they may just purchase more during the  
promotion period and sell it at regular price. The manufacturer would  
simply see a drop in orders once the promotion period is over.  
More effective for the manufacturer is the use of mail-in coupons \(di-  
rect discount to the final customer\), or *scan-back deals,* in which the  
manufacturer reimburses retailers a certain amount for each unit sold,  
so the discount is on units sold to end customers rather than on units  
purchased by the retailer. Scan-back deals eliminate forward buying by  
the retailer and aligns the retailer’s objectives with the manufacturer’s.  
**5.6.1.2 Empirical Findings**  
The promotions literature is rich in empirical work—based mostly on  
scanner POS data—that analyzes the effects of promotions on sales and  
profits in different categories. The common trends that emerge from this  
research, summarized by Blattberg, Briesch, and Fox \[74\] as *empirical* *Dynamic Pricing* 231  
*generalizations,*7 are valuable both for the practitioner as well as the  
academic researcher. Table 5.8 gives the main findings. In addition to  
the findings in Table 5.8, Blattberg, Briesch, and Fox \[74\] report some  
conflicting findings with respect to the following four questions\:  
7Blattberg, Briesch and Fox \[74\] define an empirical generalization as follows\: \(1\) the topic  
being studied is well-defined; \(2\) there are at least three articles by at least three different  
authors in which empirical research has been conducted in the specific area, and \(3\) the  
empirical evidence is consistent. 232 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Does the majority of promotional volume come from switchers rather  
than from customers increasing their consumption or category volume  
growth? The most likely explanation for the variation in the findings  
here may be the differences in the nature of the products; one can well  
imagine promotions causing consumption increase for yogurt, but not  
say, for toilet paper or ketchup.  
Do promotional elasticities exceed long-run price elasticities? That  
is, because of the temporary nature of a promotion, does it cause  
a greater increase in demand than if the firm were to permanently  
lower its price?  
Is the trough after the deal due to customers’ accelerating their pur-  
chases and stockpiling, creating a drop in the normal sales after a  
promotion? Somewhat surprisingly, there is no consensus whether  
this happens.  
Is there is a negative long-term effect to promotions? Are promo-  
tions detrimental to long-term brand equity? The findings have been  
mixed, with some studies discovering a long-term negative effect, and  
some finding both a positive and negative impact due to promotions.  
**5.6.2 Retailer Promotions**  
We next examine two normative models of promotion optimization. In  
the first model, due to Greenleaf \[221\], a monopolist retailer is assumed  
to maximize profits from promoting a particular brand. \(A “brand” is  
a particular-size of a given product.\) Customers are assume to have  
a reference price \(see Appendix E\), assumed to be an exponentially  
smoothed average of past prices, as follows\:  
where is the smoothing parameter,8 and is a 0-centered  
random variable representing the error term.  
Demand is assumed to be composed of two separable factors, a base  
demand and a reference price factor as follows\:  
where  
8Based on scanner data, Greenleaf \[221\] finds Johnson, and Fader \[237\] find models to assume *a priori* for peanut butter, and Hardie,  
for orange juice. It is also common in promotions  
—that is, the reference price is the previous period’s price. *Dynamic Pricing* 233  
The parameters model customers’ asymmetric price sensitiv-  
ity to loss or gain perception\: if customers  
value gains more than losses, and if they are loss averse,  
\(Again, see Appendix E for a discussion of consumer-choice theory based  
on valuations of losses and gains.\)  
The reference-price dynamics given by \(5.30\) capture the effect of  
current promotions on future profits; frequent and deep promotions will  
reduce customers’ reference price for the brand, and as a result  
they will start perceiving the normal price as a loss. So even though  
promotions generate short-run profits, it is in the retailer’s long-run  
interest not to run promotions too frequently.  
The retailer is assumed to maximize its discounted profits over an  
infinite planning horizon. The retailer’s discount factor is  
and the marginal cost of production is *c.* This results in the following  
dynamic program\:  
with a state evolution equation given by \(5.30\).  
Greenleaf \[221\], using simulations, shows that the optimal policy for  
the retailer obtained by solving \(5.33\) can be cyclical, oscillating be-  
tween periods of high prices and periods of low prices. Kopalle, Rao,  
and Assunção \[310\], using analytical and numerical techniques, derive a  
number of interesting structural properties of \(5.33\). Specifically, they  
show that if the entire customer population is loss averse a  
constant-price policy is optimal. On the other hand, if customers value  
gains more than losses then a cyclical policy of hi-lo pricing  
is optimal for the retailer. In other words, the asymmetry in customer  
valuations for gains and losses can be sufficient motivation to run promo-  
tions. Moreover, they numerically show for this case that the difference  
between the high and low price increases as the gain coefficient in-  
creases for a fixed level of loss coefficient and the high price increases  
as the memory parameter in \(5.30\) decreases.  
As we mentioned, retailers are more interested in category profits than  
in profits from promoting a particular brand. For a retailer managing  
brands in a category, the objective therefore is to manage the prices  
over time, This requires solving the following  
optimization problem\: 234 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where is an aggregate profit function, dependent on the prices of  
all the brands but excluding reference price effects, which are captured  
by the second term, and is of the same form as \(5.32\).  
The state as before is the reference price, and the state equation is  
Kopalle, Rao, and Assunção \[310\] analyze \(5.34\) and show once again  
that when for all brands, a cyclical pricing policy of hi-lo pricing  
is optimal, and moreover, the cycles are *in phase*—that is, all the brands  
are priced high, or all the brands are discounted together. The reason  
is that hi-lo prices in phase minimize the cross-price effect, at the same  
time allowing the retailer to take advantage of the reference-price effect.  
**5.6.3 Trade-Promotion Models**  
As we discussed, a manufacturer offers rebates to retailers to promote  
its own brand. The cooperation might take many forms \(such as joint  
advertising and store displays\), and the contracts are varied \(such as  
scan-backs and sale guarantees\).  
On the one hand, models for optimizing the manufacturer’s promo-  
tions tend to be simpler than the retailer’s problem, as the manufacturer  
is concerned with only one brand. But on the other hand, one has to  
model retailer pass-thru behavior. \(Recall that pass-thru is the per-  
centage of the discount the retailer passes on to the end consumer.\)  
This requires modeling the vertical competition between manufacturer  
and retailer. In contrast to the previous section, however, one typically  
ignores reference-price effects because the discount is offered to the re-  
tailer rather than to the end customers.  
The most widely used model for representing demand as a function  
of deal price and displays is the SCAN\*PRO model of Section 9.6.4.  
Kopalle, Mela, and Marsh \[309\] analyze a Stackelberg game between a  
manufacturer and retailer, where the demand is given by the SCAN\*PRO  
functional form. Silva-Russo, Bucklin, and Morrison \[470\] give a sim-  
pler mixed integer programming formulation \(see also Tellis and Zufry-  
den \[507\]\), where the manufacturer assumes that retailers are passive,  
but they model retailers’ pass-thru percentages. They report an imple-  
mentation of the model at a large CPG manufacturer. The formulation  
does not by itself give insight into the optimal structure or policies for  
the manufacturer, but it is reasonably practical and captures the main  
concerns of the manufacturer in the formulation of its constraints. *Dynamic Pricing* 235  
**5.7 Notes and Sources**  
The book by Nagle \[400\] provides a good general-management  
overview of pricing decisions. Elmaghraby and Keskinocak \[177\] pro-  
vide a nice current survey on research in the area of dynamic pricing.  
As for the connection between pricing- and capacity-allocation decisions,  
see Walczak and Brumelle \[543\].  
Smith and Achabal \[480\] study a continuous-time version of the prob-  
lem with inventory-depletion effect as in Section 5.2.1.5. They also study  
the problem of selecting the optimal initial inventory and report sum-  
mary results of tests of the model at several major retailers. Heching,  
Gallego, and van Ryzin \[247\] provide revenue estimates based on a re-  
gression test of this same type of deterministic model on data from an  
apparel retailer.  
Gallego and van Ryzin \[198\] analyzed a continuous-time, time-  
homogeneous version of the stochastic model of Section 5.2.2, providing  
monotonicity properties of the optimal price, an exact solution in the  
exponential demand case, and proving the asymptotic optimality of the  
deterministic policy as in Section 5.2.2.3. Bitran and Mondschein \[73\]  
analyze a discrete-time model of the problem essentially the same as  
that presented in Section 5.2.2 and test in on apparel retail data. Zhao  
and Zheng \[589\] analyze the continuous-time model with a time-varying  
demand function and provide an alternative proof of monotonicity of  
the marginal values they also provide results on the monotonic-  
ity of optimal prices over time. See also Kincaid and Darling \[304\] and  
Stadje \[484\]. Das Varmand and Vettas \[145\] analyze the problem of  
selling a finite supply over an infinite horizon with discounted revenues,  
where the discounting provides an incentive to sell items sooner rather  
than later and there is no hard deadline on the sales season.  
Stochastic models with discrete price changes are analyzed in the  
continuous-time case in a series of papers by Feng and Gallego \[185, 186\]  
and Feng and Xiao \[188, 189\]. The problems differ in terms of whether  
there are two prices or more than two prices, whether the price changes  
are reversible or one-way changes. Feng and Gallego \[186\] extend the  
analysis also to the interesting case where demand is Markovian and may  
depend on the current inventory level—for example, as in the classical  
Bass model of new-product diffusion. The notion of the *maximum con-*  
*cave envelope* of prices is due to Feng and Xiao \[188\]. See also You \[586\]  
for a discrete-time analysis of the problem.  
There is an extensive literature on production-pricing problems.  
Eliashberg and Steinberg \[175\] provide of review of joint pricing and  
production models. Single-period, convex-cost problems under demand  
uncertainty are analyzed by Karlin and Carr \[293\], Mills \[386\], and the 236 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
early paper of Whitin \[564\]. The literature on single-period pricing un-  
der demand uncertainty \(the price-dependent newsvendor problem\) is  
surveyed by Petruzzi and Dada \[417\]. Multiperiod, convex cost models  
are analyzed by Hempenius \[249\], Thowsen \[509\], and Zabel \[509\].  
Rajan, Rakesh, and Steinberg \[433\] analyze a deterministic model  
of dynamic pricing within an inventory replenishment cycle, where the  
motivation for dynamic pricing is the deterioration in the product as well  
as its declining market value with age \(for example, pricing perishable  
foods\).  
The optimality of the greedy allocation algorithm for the determinis-  
tic production-pricing problem with capacity constraints was shown by  
Chann, Simchi-Levi, and Swann \[105\]. The optimality of the base-stock,  
posted-price policy discussed in Section 5.3.2 was proved by Federgruen  
and Heching \[183\]. The fixed-cost version of this problem was recently  
analyzed by Chen and Simchi-Levi \[113\].  
Multiproduct, multiresource dynamic-pricing problems were analyzed  
in Gallego and van Ryzin \[199\], including bounds on the relationship  
between the stochastic and deterministic versions of the problem. The  
action-space-reduction approach is a recent result due to Maglaras and  
Meissner \[354\]. A related network pricing we have omitted is congestion  
pricing for communications service; see for example Pashalidis \[413\].  
Stokey \[490\] analyzes a model of intertemporal price discrimina-  
tion similar to that presented in Section 5.5.1. See also Kalish \[279\].  
Stokey \[491\] analyzes a price-skimming model with rational customers  
under the assumption that the firm can commit to a price schedule. The  
material in Section 5.5.2 on the subgame-perfect pricing equilibrium for  
a firm faced with strategic customers is from Besanko and Winston \[47\].  
The artificial-intelligence community also has recently become inter-  
ested in dynamic pricing, using autonomous software agents. The ap-  
proach is simulation based, with experiments using various strategies  
for the players. Although relevant, the approach is beyond the scope of  
this book, though the interested reader can refer to Morris, Ree, and  
Maes \[393\] and Morris and Maes \[392\].  
The literature on promotions is rich in empirical work, which we  
have summarized, somewhat tersely, in Table 5.8. The material in  
Section 5.6.1.2 is entirely from Blattberg, Briesch, and Fox \[74\]. For  
more empirical generalization articles, see Bell, Chiang, and Padmanab-  
han \[34\] and Sethuraman and Srinivasan \[458\].  
The standard reference on promotions is the book by Blattberg and  
Neslin \[76\]. There is a large body of work that tries to understand  
the interactions between the retailer and the manufacturer using game  
theory, which we do not have the opportunity to cover here—see Lal and *APPENDIX 5. A\: Proof of Monotonicity Results* 237  
Villas-Boas \[322, 323\], Lal \[325, 324\], Rao, Arjuni, and Murthi \[436\],  
Gerstner and Hess \[211\] and Bell, Iyer, and Padmanabhan \[35\].  
# APPENDIX 5.A\: Proof of Monotonicity Results  
# Proof of Proposition 5.1  
Since there are multiple parts, we restate the proposition\:  
*If Assumptions 5.1 and 5.2 hold, then for all*  
*\(i\) is jointly concave in and*  
*\(ii\) is concave in*  
*\(iii\) is increasing in and decreasing in*  
We first need a preliminary result\:  
LEMMA 5-5.A.1 *If Assumption 5.2 holds, then the truncated revenue function*  
*is jointly concave in and on the for and*  
Proof  
By definition,  
By Assumption 5.2, the term is concave in and is concave  
as well. Also note if then will also be jointly concave in and This  
follows because the Hessian  
is negative definite, since both Therefore, and the determinant  
is jointly concave because it is the minimum  
of two concave functions. Finally, taking expectations preserves concavity, hence  
is jointly concave. *QED*  
We are now ready to prove Proposition 5.1. Parts \(i\) and \(ii\) are related by  
induction. Indeed, we first show that if is jointly concave in and  
Assumptions 5.2 holds \(so by Lemma 5-5.A.1 is jointly concave in and  
then is concave in To do so, consider any two values nonnegative values  
and and any real satisfying For notational convenience define the  
convex combination and let denote the value that maximizes

where the last inequality follows from the joint concavity of and So  
is concave in provided is concave \(Assumption 7.2\), and is jointly concave.  
Likewise, we show that is jointly concave if is concave and Assump-  
tion 5.1 holds. To see this, consider any four nonnegative and any real 238 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
satisfying Define and Then  
where the first inequality follows from Assumption 5.1, is increasing in and  
the second inequality follows from the fact that in concave.  
Parts \(i\) and \(ii\) of Proposition 5.1 now follow from these two results using an  
induction argument and the fact that for all which is concave.  
Finally, to show part \(iii\), note that the fact that is decreasing in  
follows from the concavity of in \(part \(i\)\). To show it is increasing in take a  
nonnegative and note that the difference  
is oppositive since increasing in by the concavity of then have that the difference  
by Assumption 5.1 and therefore is  
Therefore, taking expectations above we  
is increasing in as well. Since  
it therefore follows that is increasing in *QED*  
# Proof of Proposition 5.2  
The proof here is essentially identical to Proposition 2-2.A.4 result for the discrete-  
choice single-resource model in Appendix 2.A.  
We first show that is decreasing in The proof is by induction on First,  
this is trivially true for by the boundary conditions for all  
Assume it is true for period and consider period Let denote the optimal  
solution to \(5.12\) for inventory level that is, it is an optimal solution in the

Substituting into \(5.A.0\) we obtain  
Rearranging and canceling terms yields

and since values are at most one \(expected demand in a period is at most one in the  
discrete Poisson case\), and Therefore,  
\(Note the concavity of is not required for this part of the proof.\)  
To show monotonicity in using the same notation note that

# AUCTIONS  
**6.1 Introduction and Industry Overview**  
Auctions provide an alternative means of dynamically adjusting prices  
to match market conditions. An auction is simply a set of rules \(called a  
*mechanism*\) for specifying how information is revealed among customers  
and the firm, how goods are awarded to customers, and what payments  
are made from customers to the firm based on the revealed information.  
They differ from a dynamic posted-price mechanism in that typically  
customers are the ones who offer a price they are willing to pay—their  
*bid*—and the firm then decides which bids to accept. However, there are  
some auction formats that rather resemble posted pricing, in that the  
firm names a price, and customers simply indicate their willingness to  
buy at the offered price. As we show below, the prices in an auction  
depend both on the number of customers bidding and their valuations  
for items—and, not surprisingly, the more customers there are, or the  
more each customer values the items, the higher the prices generated  
by an auction. In this way, auction prices effectively “adapt” to market  
conditions, and hence they are often viewed as *price-discovery mecha-*  
*nisms.*  
Auctions are important both practically and theoretically. On a prac-  
tical level, auctions are encountered in many markets, including those for  
treasury bonds, livestock, used cars, electricity, foreign exchange, real es-  
tate, art and rare collectibles, fish, fresh flowers, industrial procurement,  
public-works contracts, and the sale of natural-resource rights \(such as  
offshore oil and gas leases, logging rights, radio spectrum licenses, and  
so on\). More recently, auctions have gained popularity with the success  
of e-commerce auction sites such as eBay. 242 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
From a revenue management perspective, in particular, auctions have  
some appealing features. First, they hold out the potential of achieving  
near-perfect, first-degree price discrimination, and although customers  
still retain some “information rent” that prevents a firm from capturing  
the entire consumer surplus, the revenue benefits over using a single  
price—or even second- and third-degree price discrimination—can be  
significant. Second, auctions have the potential to directly uncover these  
near-optimal prices without the need to estimate customers’ demand  
functions or willingness to pay, though this statement again must be  
qualified somewhat as we explain shortly. Nevertheless, it is fair to say  
that most auction mechanisms generally require less information about  
customers than do alternative price-discrimination mechanisms.  
On a theoretical level, auctions are important because they provide a  
rich framework for studying pricing mechanisms in settings where cus-  
tomers act strategically. Indeed, as we show in this chapter, auction  
theory can often be used to design *optimal mechanisms*—that is, mech-  
anisms that maximize revenues among essentially all possible pricing  
mechanisms, under certain assumptions of course. In other cases, the  
theory provides convenient ways to compare the revenues produced by  
different pricing mechanisms. Also, the theory is based on a strategic  
\(rational\) consumer model, which adds to the realism of auction models  
relative to the \(mainly\) myopic models studied in Chapter 5.  
We first look at some common examples of auctions in practice. Then,  
in Section 6.2, we describe the classical auction models and theory. Next,  
we look at dynamic auctions, both in the setting of selling a fixed capac-  
ity as in Chapter 2 and in a replenishment setting, where the firm orders  
and auctions over an infinite horizon as in the inventory-pricing problem  
of Section 5.3.2. Finally, we consider network auctions and discuss their  
relationship to the network RM problems of Chapter 3.  
**6.1.1 An Overview of Auctions in Practice**  
Auctions are used in a wide range of markets, including industrial,  
financial, and consumer markets. We briefly survey next each of these  
markets in turn.  
**6.1.1.1 Traditional Auction Houses**  
Traditional auction houses—the two largest being Christie’s and  
Sotheby’s—provide auctions for selling art, antiques, jewelry, wine, and  
other rare, high-value collectibles. Both have been doing so for a very  
long time indeed; Sotheby’s was founded in 1744 and Christie’s in 1766.  
Christie’s is the market leader with sales of \$2.3 billion in 2000. Both  
use a variation of an ascending, open-price \(English\) auction. \(See Sec- *Auctions* 243  
tion 6.1.2 below for definitions of these auction types.\) As of January  
2000, Sotheby’s started offering online auctions. These traditional auc-  
tion houses generally limit themselves to high-value items, and their  
clientele are largely wealthy individuals and institutional collectors.  
# 6.1.1.2  
# Financial-Market Auctions  
Auctions have been used for many years in financial markets. Most  
government bonds and bills are sold at auctions, which are conducted at  
regular intervals to finance national debts. Investors \(both institutional  
and individual\) bid for the minimum interest rate they are willing to  
receive. The selling agency then sorts the bids and the bonds or bills  
are awarded to the lowest bidders until the desired amount of the issue  
is reached.  
Auctions are also used by securities exchanges for trading stocks,  
bonds and foreign exchange. Typically, these are *double auctions* in  
which *bid* offers are made by customers and *ask* offers are made by sell-  
ers. A queue of bid and ask offers is maintained and trade takes place  
when the highest bid offer in queue exceeds the lowest ask offer in queue.  
\(The rules for the price paid and how this matching takes place are usu-  
ally specific to each exchange.\)  
**6.1.1.3 Government Auctions**  
Governments use auctions for the sale of many public assets, including  
public lands, public industries \(privatization sales\), and natural-resource  
rights. A prominent example is the radio spectrum auctions for third-  
generation \(3G\) cellular phone service in Europe and the United States  
These spectrum auctions involved complex combinatorial features, in  
which communications companies bid for combinations of geographical  
areas to achieve coverage in a given market area. The sale prices pro-  
duced by some of these auctions were staggering, and indeed the resulting  
debts incurred to finance these purchases have left many of the winning  
companies in a precarious financial position.  
**6.1.1.4 Industrial-Procurement Auctions**  
Auctions are also used in many industries for procurement of materi-  
als, services, and general subcontracting of production. Typically, this  
occurs through a request-for-quote \(RFQ\) process in which a buying  
firm details its requirements for a certain input, and selling firms sub-  
mit price quotes to supply the input. Factors other than price, such as  
quality levels and delivery schedules, are typically important in the final  
selection as well. 244 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Online versions of procurement auctions have also increased in the  
past several years. In the auto industry, the exchange Covisint was  
formed in early 2000 as a joint venture by Daimler-Chrysler, Ford Motor  
Company, and General Motors with technology provided by Commerce  
One and Oracle. The goal of the exchange is to facilitate integration and  
collaboration among suppliers and automakers, with the aim of lower-  
ing costs and facilitating more efficient business practices. The Covisint  
exchange supports a range of auction formats for procurement. FreeMar-  
kets, which has been in operation since 1995, combines software products  
with market-making services that help facilitate real-time procurement  
auctions over the Internet. The company reports sales transactions of  
over \$35 billion to date on their reverse-price auction systems and ser-  
vices. Many manufacturers also host their own private online auctions  
for procurement.  
**6.1.1.5 Consumer Online Auctions**  
Online consumer auctions have become popular, largely due to the  
success of eBay. eBay provides a platform for users to conduct auctions  
to buy and sell a wide range of items—a sort of Sotheby’s OR Christie’s  
for the common man.  
An immense variety of items are sold on eBay—new, used, and col-  
lectibles, by both individuals and small businesses. It is by some mea-  
sures, the most popular shopping site on the Internet as of this writing.1  
In 2001, eBay transacted more than \$9.3 billion in gross merchandise  
sales. Most significantly, the company has proven that the Internet can  
be used to facilitate communication and trade among geographically dis-  
persed individual buyers and sellers, allowing for the sort of real-time  
auction mechanisms that in the past required the physical presence of  
market participants.  
Priceline.com provides a different online auction mechanism. It is  
based on what they term a “buyer-driven conditional purchase offer”  
mechanism,2 in which customers declare what they are willing to pay  
for products and supplying firms accept or reject these offers. In return,  
consumers agree to varying degrees of flexibility in the brand and prod-  
uct features they receive for their offered price. This mechanism has  
proved quite popular as a channel for selling surplus airline seats and  
is gaining popularity for products such as discount phone service and  
home mortgages.  
1For example, in 2000 eBay was the shopping site with the highest number of total user  
minutes according to Media Metrix. 2Priceline.com has been granted a United States patent for this invention. *Auctions* 245  
Priceline is attractive to sellers in large part because the mechanism  
does not divulge the identity of the seller until after the purchase of-  
fer is accepted. \(Customers bid on generic products and features, not  
specific brands.\) This creates less of a pricing risk for a firm because it  
can discount without fear that its discounted prices will become widely  
known to other customers and to competitors. This feature produces  
*brand shielding* and such selling formats are often referred to as *opaque*  
*channels* in industry terminology. However, as we show in Section 6.3.3  
below, under certain assumptions, this mechanism theoretically offers  
no benefit over list prices. \(Priceline.com is discussed further in Chap-  
ter 10.\)  
**6.1.2 Types of Auctions**  
There are a variety of mechanisms one can use to conduct an auction.  
For simplicity we focus first on the case of a firm auctioning a single  
indivisible good to a group of *N* customers. We then consider several  
variations of these simple, single-unit auctions.  
**6.1.2.1 Standard Auction Types**  
There are four common types of auctions for selling a single object\:  
**Open ascending \(English\) auction** In an open ascending auction,  
the firm announces a progressively increasing sequence of prices. Cus-  
tomers indicate \(say by raising their hand or showing a number\) their  
willingness to buy an item at the announced price. The firm increases  
the price until only one customer is left willing to buy at the an-  
nounced price. This is the mechanism commonly used to sell art and  
valuables at major auction houses such as Christie’s and Sotheby’s.  
**Open descending \(Dutch\) auction** In an open descending auc-  
tion, the firm announces a progressively decreasing sequence of prices.  
The first customer to indicate willingness to buy at the announced  
price wins the item and pays the current price. The Aalsmeer and  
Naaldwijk flower markets in Holland have long used this type of auc-  
tion, which explains the name.  
**Sealed-bid, first-price auction** In the sealed-bid, first-price auc-  
tion, customers submit sealed bids to the firm. The customer submit-  
ting the highest bid wins the auction and pays the amount of his bid.  
This form of auction is used \(in its minimization form\) for awarding  
many government contracts.  
**Sealed-bid, second-price \(Vickrey\) auction** In the sealed-bid,  
second-price auction, customers again submit sealed bids, and the 246 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
customer submitting the highest bid wins the auction. However, the  
amount the winner pays is equal to the second-highest bid submitted.  
While this auction form has certain desirable theoretical properties,  
as shown by Vickrey \[533\], it is somewhat less common in practice.3  
These basic auction types can be varied\: for example, one may impose  
a reserve price or minimum bid increments. Moreover, there are other,  
less standard, auction types that are encountered in practice as well,  
such as the *uniform price auction* used in many financial markets. The  
above four types, however, are the most common.  
An auction is called a *reverse auction* if customers are competing to  
sell to the auctioneer by submitting cost \(or willingness to sell\) bids  
rather than price \(or willingness to buy\) bids, such as in a procurement  
auction. Reverse auctions are essentially equivalent to regular auctions  
if we put a “minus sign” on the rewards \(one involves maximization of  
price while the other involves minimization of cost\), and hence we do  
not address them separately here.  
**6.1.2.2 Multiunit Auctions**  
Multiunit versions of the above auction types can also be defined in the  
natural way. For example, suppose the firm has *C* homogeneous items  
to sell and each customer wants only at most one item. Then in the *C-*  
unit open ascending auction, the firm announces increasing prices, and  
customers indicate their willingness to pay the offered prices. The price  
is increased until only *C* customers remain and each is awarded an item  
at the prevailing price. In an open descending auction, the price declines  
until a customer indicates willingness to pay the announced price. The  
customer is awarded a unit at that price, and the firm continues to  
decrease the price until a second customer is willing to pay the announced  
price, and so on until all *C* units have been awarded.  
In a sealed-bid, first-price auction, the *C* highest bids are accepted,  
and each pays his bid; in a sealed-bid, second-price auction, the *C* highest  
bidders are awarded the item and each pays the highest bid.  
Again, more complex multiunit auctions exist in practice. For exam-  
ple, customers may bid for multiple units. In a sealed-bid, first-price  
auction, this is accomplished by having customers submit a *demand*  
*schedule*—a list of quantities and prices they are willing to pay for each  
marginal unit they buy. The firm then awards items to the *C* highest  
marginal values, which may involve awarding multiple units to a sin-  
3Though Lucking-Reily \[351\] points out that the Vickrey auction is more commonly used  
than most people realize. *Auctions* 247  
gle customer. In this chapter, we only consider the simple, single-unit  
demand version of multiunit auctions.  
**6.1.2.3 Combinatorial Auctions**  
Another complexity in many procurement auctions is that a customer  
may require several products simultaneously. For example, to complete  
production of a product, a manufacturer may need both metal and plas-  
tic resin, or to provide cell phone service in a particular region, a com-  
munications company may need licenses in several contiguous regions.  
Such problems create dependencies, in which customers are willing to  
pay more for certain combinations of items than the sum of what they  
would be willing to pay for each item alone.  
In such cases, one can construct auctions where the customers submit  
bids for various combinations of items rather than individual bids for  
each item alone, and the firm must then decide on which combinations to  
award based on these bids. Such problems may require solving complex,  
combinatorial optimization problems to simply determine the winners of  
the auction. Understanding the customers’ behavior in the face of such  
complex auctions is quite difficult. We examine one such combinatorial  
auction in Section 6.5 below, in which customers bid for “products” that  
require a subset of “resources” and the firm has to allocate a finite supply  
of these resources to the customers based on their bids. This problem  
closely matches the network problems of Chapter 3.  
**6.2 Independent Private-Value Theory**  
In this section, we present the basic theory of auctions for the so-  
called *independent private-value* model, which is the most widely studied  
in the literature. In addition, we focus here on the revenue-generating  
properties of auctions and largely ignore welfare and allocative efficiency  
properties. Readers interested in these properties and other extensions  
of the basic theory are referred to survey papers by Klemperer \[305\],  
Matthews \[366\], McAfee \[369\], and Milgrom \[381\].  
**6.2.1 Independent Private-Value Model and**  
# Assumptions  
Consider an auction in which we are selling one or more homogeneous  
objects to *N* potential customers. Each customer desires at most one  
of the objects. Customer values an object at The valuations  
are private information to the individual customers, but it is common  
knowledge that are i.i.d. with a distribution *F.* We assume that 248 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
*F* is strictly increasing with a continuous density function and has  
bounded support on the interval so *F*\(0\) = 0 and  
Note that the assumption that customers have i.i.d. valuations and all  
know *F* is not equivalent to saying all customers are the same. Indeed,  
because customers valuations are draws from a distribution, some cus-  
tomers will have high valuations, and some will have low ones; *F* merely  
describes the distribution of valuations in the customer population. In  
addition, customers know their valuation; thus, a customer with a high  
\(low\) valuation will *know* that his valuation is higher \(or lower\) than av-  
erage and will bid accordingly. The assumption of i.i.d. valuations and  
symmetry is more precisely a statement about the views the participants  
hold about the market. It is equivalent to saying that all customers and  
the firm have the *same belief* about the likely valuations of other cus-  
tomers and that there is no discernable difference among customers a  
*priori.*  
**6.2.2 An Informal Analysis of Sealed-Bid, First-**  
# and Second-Price Auctions  
First, to build some initial intuition we start with a somewhat informal  
analysis of the sealed-bid, first- and second-price auctions. A formal  
equilibrium analysis is then provided in Section 6.2.3.  
A key feature of auction models is that they assume customers are  
rational; that is, they bid so as to maximize their surplus \(the value  
of the item minus the price they pay\). Hence, for each mechanism we  
need to analyze customers’ bids as a function of their valuations—called  
their *bidding strategy.* When formulating his bidding strategy, a ratio-  
nal customer will take into account the bidding strategies of the other  
customers. Our auction analysis therefore relies on the concept of an  
*equilibrium set of strategies;* that is, a set of strategies such that each  
customer has no incentive to change his strategy provided the other cus-  
tomers do not change their strategies \(Nash equilibrium in game-theory  
terminology; see Appendix F\).  
We are also interested in the revenues produced by a given auction.  
These revenues depend on the strategic, equilibrium response of cus-  
tomers. So changes in the mechanism will lead to changes in the equi-  
librium bidding strategies of customers, which in turn will affect the  
revenues the firm generates. Thus, a “good” mechanism induces a more  
profitable equilibrium, and this makes the revenue analysis of auctions  
qualitatively different from the analyses we have seen in the previous  
chapters. *Auctions* 249  
**6.2.2.1 Equilibrium Strategies for a Second-Price Auction**  
Consider first a single-unit, sealed-bid, second-price auction with *N*  
customers. Recall that in this case each of the *N* customers submits a  
bid, the firm awards the item to the customer with the highest bid, and  
the winner pays the value of the second-highest bid. Let  
denote the vector of bids submitted by the *N* customers and let  
denote the reverse-order statistic\: that is, Hence,  
denotes the value of the second-highest bid \(the winner’s payment\).  
A bidding strategy for customer specifies the bid customer will submit  
as a function of his valuation and is denoted A bidding strategy  
that is an equilibrium strategy is denoted \(to denote that it is an  
optimal response to the strategies of other customers\).  
How would a rational customer bid in this type of auction? The  
answer, it turns out, is surprisingly simple. Each customer cannot do  
better than to simply bid his own valuation that is, the strategy of  
bidding is optimal for all customers  
To see this, note that the amount the winner pays in a second-price  
auction is not affected by his bid since he pays an amount equal to the 250 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
second-highest bid. In other words, a customer’s bid affects whether he  
wins but not how much he pays if he wins. Now suppose customer  
bids Consider the two possible cases—customer wins or customer  
loses—and see whether customer can do better by changing his bid  
in either case. The situation is shown in Figure 6.1.  
First, consider case \(i\) on the left of Figure 6.1, where customer  
wins the auction by bidding In this case, customer has a surplus  
of Now if he increases his bid to it has no effect  
because he is still the highest bidder and still pays an amount equal to  
the second-highest bid. So customer cannot do better by increasing his  
bid. If customer is a winner and decreases his bid to there is  
again no change in his surplus as long as he remains the highest bidder.  
However, if—as shown on the left-hand side of Figure 6.1—he lowers his  
bid enough to become the second-highest bidder, then he is no longer the  
winner and his surplus is zero. Since his surplus was positive beforehand,  
this is not an improvement either. Thus, customer cannot do better  
than bidding in case \(i\).  
Now consider case \(ii\) on the right of Figure 6.1, in which customer  
bids and loses. Customer surplus in this case is zero because he does  
not get the item and pays nothing. Note also in this case, the highest  
bid is strictly greater than that is, Now if he decreases  
his bid to he remains one of the losers, and his surplus is still  
zero. If he increases his bid to again there is no change unless he  
increases his bid enough to become the new highest bidder. But in this  
case, he must pay an amount equal to the previous high-bidder’s bid,  
which is strictly greater than his own valuation \(else he would have  
been the high bidder originally\). So his surplus in this case is negative,  
he is worse off. Hence, he cannot do better than bidding in case \(ii\)  
either. Therefore, in both cases \(i\) and \(ii\), bidding is an optimal  
decision for customer  
Note that this strategy is optimal regardless of the bids placed by other  
customers. Indeed, our analysis did not make any assumptions on the  
strategies used by other customers; the strategy is optimal for  
*any realization* of competing bids. Such a strategy is called a *dominant*  
*strategy,* and the set of such strategies is called  
a *dominant-strategy equilibrium* for the auction. \(See Appendix F.\)  
A dominant-strategy equilibrium is a robust equilibrium. It applies  
under very general conditions; essentially, we need assume only that  
customers have private valuations \(the valuation that customer has  
for the item is not influenced by the valuations of other customers\) and  
customers are rational so that they recognize the benefit of this strat-  
egy. We need little else beyond these two assumptions. For example, *Auctions* 251  
customers can have different distributions of valuations, have different  
information about the distributions, and may be risk-averse. None of  
these change the equilibrium under the second-price mechanism because  
of the strong dominance of the bidding strategy.  
Under this equilibrium, the firm earns a revenue equal to the sec-  
ond reverse-order statistic of the distribution a quantity that is  
not difficult to evaluate \(at least numerically\). The following example  
illustrates both the equilibrium and the revenue calculation.  
**Example 6.1** There are *N* customers with valuations uniformly distributed on \[0,1\],  
so on this interval. Under the second-price auction, it is a dominant-strategy  
equilibrium for each customer to adopt the strategy  
The expected revenue earned by the firm is just —the value of the second  
highest bid. It is not hard to show for the uniform distribution that  
Thus, the firm’s average revenue increases with the number of bidders *N.*  
**6.2.2.2 Equilibrium Strategies for a First-Price Auction**  
Consider next a first-price auction, in which the highest bidder wins  
the item and pays his bid. We consider only symmetric bidding strate-  
gies in this case. That is, we assume each customer uses the same  
bidding strategy and therefore bids an amount This is  
a reasonable assumption given that customer valuations are symmetric  
\(have valuations independently drawn from the same distribution  
We also assume that a customer’s bid is increasing in his valuation \(cus-  
tomers with higher valuations bid more\), so the bid strategy is  
increasing in This assumption is verified afterward. As before, an  
equilibrium strategy is denoted  
Again, we are looking for an equilibrium bid function such that if  
all customers are using the strategy then no customer is able  
to improve his expected surplus by bidding anything other than  
We then use the first-order conditions for this equilibrium to derive a  
differential equation for the bid function  
To begin, note that a customer with valuation if he is the highest bidder; that is, if will win the item  
for all So  
customer probability of winning is4  
4Equation \(6.1\) contains a minor abuse of notation\: the *P*\(·\) on the left-hand side represents a  
function of the bids \(albeit a probability\), while the right-hand side *P*\(·\) stands, as throughout  
the book, for probability of an event. 252 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where the second inequality follows from the assumption that strategy  
is strictly increasing in Since the argument is generic to any  
customer we henceforth drop the subscript and consider an arbitrary  
customer with valuation  
Now suppose our customer could improve his expected surplus by  
adopting the strategy of a customer with valuation different from  
Specifically, the customer would bid and thus win with probability  
but would still value the item at In this case, his expected  
surplus would be  
If the strategy is truly an equilibrium, this surplus should be max-  
imized at \(otherwise, would not be the customer’s optimal  
bid\). Therefore, applying the first-order optimality conditions, we can  
differentiate \(6.2\) with respect to set the result to zero at and  
obtain the following differential equation for  
The solution to this differential equation is somewhat tedious to derive,  
but one can verify that it is5  
where is the probability of winning given by \(6.1\).6  
Note that the equilibrium strategy \(6.4\) is continuous and increasing  
in and increasing in *N* \(higher-valuation customers bid more; and the  
more customers there are, the higher a given customer bids\). One can  
also show that it is the unique symmetric equilibrium for this problem  
\(Riley and Samuelson \[441\]\).  
Note from \(6.4\) that so customers in a first-price auction  
will bid strictly less than their valuation. Hence, unlike in the second-  
price auction, they *shade* their true valuations when bidding. This is to  
be expected because customers are required to pay what they bid, so  
they must shade their bids to make a positive surplus from winning.  
5To check this, just use the fact that into the right-hand side of \(6.3\).  
6A boundary condition of is required as well; see Appendix 6.A.  
and substitute \(6.4\) *Auctions* 253  
Finally, the revenue to the firm is the expected value of the highest  
bidder’s bid because the winner pays his valuation. So the firm’s ex-  
pected revenue is Again, the mean of this order statistic is  
not difficult to compute numerically or by simulation.  
To illustrate, consider again the example of uniformly distributed val-  
uations\:  
**Example 6.2** There are *N* customers with valuations uniformly distributed on \[0,1\],  
on this interval. In this case, and the equilibrium bidding  
so strategy is  
So each customer bids a fraction of his valuation; hence, customers with higher  
valuations bid more, and the more customers *N,* the closer each bids to his actual  
valuation.  
Since the highest bidder wins, the expected revenue to the firm is then  
It is not hard to show for the uniform distribution that  
Therefore, the firm’s expected revenue is  
Note that the expected revenue for the firm is the same in this example  
and in Example 6.2 for the second-price auction. In other words, the firm  
generates the same expected revenue regardless of which auction it runs.  
As we show below, this is not a coincidence; rather, it is a consequence  
of general conditions that guarantee that these two auctions are always  
revenue equivalent under the private-value model.  
**6.2.2.3 Strategic Equivalence of Open and Sealed-Bid**  
# Auctions  
In the private-value model, the open descending \(Dutch\) auction is  
strategically equivalent to the sealed-bid, first-price auction in the sense  
that the equilibrium strategies for the two mechanisms are the same.  
That is, if is a symmetric equilibrium in a sealed-bid, first-price  
auction, then it is also a symmetric equilibrium in a open descending  
auction, and vice versa. This is true because in an open descending  
auction, each customer \(knowing his valuation calculates his expected  
surplus at each price given that there are no other customers willing  
to buy at He then determines the value at which this surplus is 254 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
maximized and bids when the price drops to But this is exactly  
the same calculation the customer must make when submitting a bid in  
a sealed-bid, first-price auction. Hence, the equilibrium strategies are  
the same.  
Likewise, an open ascending auction can be shown to be strategi-  
cally equivalent to a sealed-bid, second-price \(Vickrey\) auction under  
the independent private-value model. In an open ascending auction, it  
is always optimal for a customer to stay in the bidding as long as the an-  
nounced price is below his valuation —and to drop out once the price  
exceeds But this is equivalent to the strategy of bidding  
in a second-price auction, since in both cases if the customer wins, he  
ends up paying the valuation of the second-highest customer. And as  
we showed in Section 6.2.2.1, is a dominant-strategy equilib-  
rium in the Vickrey auction. Hence, the two auctions are strategically  
equivalent.  
Because of this equivalence, we henceforth refer to these two cases  
as simply the *first-price* and *second-price* auctions—without specifying  
whether the mechanism is the open- or sealed-bid version.  
**6.2.3 Formal Game-Theoretic Analysis**  
We now formalize and generalize the analysis of bidding equilibria  
for a general auction mechanism. Formally, a *bidding strategy* for cus-  
tomer is a function that specifies the bid that customer will  
submit conditional on his valuation We let de-  
note the vector of valuations and denote  
the vector of bidding strategies used by the *N* customers. We let  
that is, the vector **v** without the compo-  
nent. Similarly, let  
denote the bid strategies for all customers other than  
An *auction mechanism* is specified by a pair of mappings  
that defines the allocations of the goods and  
that defines payments made by the customers \(equivalently, revenue re-  
ceived by the firm\) as a function of their bids. The firm chooses the  
auction mechanism before the auction is conducted and announces it to  
all customers, so the mechanism too is common knowledge.  
Suppose customer chooses a strategy Then  
is the allocation of goods to customer which is equal to 1 if he is  
awarded a unit, and 0 otherwise. Given his bid the probability *Auctions* 255  
that customer is awarded a unit is given by  
Similarly, is the payment made by customer given  
the bid vector **b**\(**v**\), and his expected payment is  
Note the expected payment is the expected revenue received by the firm.  
When the number of players *N* is random, each player computes his op-  
timal action by conditioning both on the valuations of the other players  
and the total number of players in the game.  
Customers are assumed to be rational and attempt to maximize their  
expected net utility \(the value of the item less the price paid to the  
firm\). Therefore, customer chooses his strategy to maximize his  
expected surplus  
For example, in the case of the single-unit, first-price auction, the item  
is awarded to the highest bidder who pays the auctioneer the value  
of his bid; all other bidders pay nothing. Then if is the  
highest bidder and wins the item\), then and  
and if is not the winning bidder\),  
and So the expected  
net utility is simply  
We assume that customers choose their strategies without collusion.  
In this case, they play a noncooperative game of incomplete information.  
An appropriate solution concept in this context is that of the Bayesian  
equilibrium of Harsanyi \[241\], an extension of the ordinary Nash equi-  
librium \[402\]. Specifically, a vector of strategies is an  
*equilibrium strategy* if, for all customer best response is to maintain  
his strategy provided all other customers maintain their strategies  
Formally,  
In other words, no customer has an incentive to change his strategy if all  
other customers maintain their strategies. We further restrict ourselves  
and consider only *symmetric* equilibria; that is, strategies for which the  
equilibrium strategy is the same for all As mentioned, this  
assumption is reasonable given that customer valuations are assumed  
symmetric; however, it is a restriction nevertheless, and one cannot rule  
out the fact that asymmetric bidding strategies may exist. Henceforth,  
we let denote such a symmetric equilibrium strategy. 256 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**6.2.3.1 Direct-Revelation Mechanisms**  
The analysis of equilibrium bidding strategies is greatly simplified by  
considering what are called *direct-revelation mechanisms.* Essentially,  
a direct-revelation mechanism is one in which a customer’s equilibrium  
strategy is to bid his true valuation For any mechanism that has  
an equilibrium it turns out, we can always find an equivalent direct-  
revelation mechanism.  
To see this, note that if is a symmetric equilibrium for some  
given auction mechanism, then the firm can always define an alterna-  
tive mechanism \(the direct-revelation mechanism\) in which customers  
submit bids, the firm inserts these bids into the function and the  
resulting values are treated as bids under the rules of the original auction  
mechanism. The situation is illustrated in Figure 6.2. Since is an  
equilibrium strategy, it follows that under the direct-revelation mecha-  
nism it is an optimal strategy for every customer to bid his valuation  
since otherwise it would contradict the fact that is an equi-  
librium strategy. Conversely, if there does not exist a direct-revelation  
mechanism defined by some in which bidding is an equilibrium,  
then there cannot be any equilibrium bidding strategy under the original  
mechanism, otherwise the corresponding equilibrium would define  
such a direct-revelation mechanism.  
In this way, we can reduce the equilibrium analysis of any mecha-  
nism to an analysis of the corresponding direct-revelation mechanism,  
in which case we can view the allocation and payments as being di-  
rectly a function of the customers’ valuations—denoted and  
respectively \(because the optimal strategy is for customers  
to bid their valuations\). This approach is illustrated in Figure 6.2.  
Let denote customer expected payment  
under a direct-revelation mechanism. The equilib-  
rium can be analyzed by noting that the expected surplus in the direct-  
revelation mechanism, defined by  
must satisfy  
for all customers In other words, for each customer revealing his  
true valuation is no worse than pretending to have another valuation  
This condition is called the *incentive compatibility constraint* because  
it requires that it be in customer self-interest to truthfully reveal his  
valuation. *Auctions* 257  
**6.2.4 Revenue Equivalence**  
How much revenue is generated for the firm by a given auction mech-  
anism? At first, answering this question would appear to be a hopeless  
task because each auction mechanism leads to different equilibrium bid-  
ding strategies and equilibrium payments. Finding and evaluating these  
various equilibria for a reasonable range of mechanisms \(or ideally all  
possible mechanisms\) is a daunting task. However, it turns out that the  
expected revenue generated by a private-value auction can be reduced to  
an analysis only of the resulting allocations without explic-  
itly solving for the equilibrium bidding strategies. The only conditions  
required are that the functions are increasing in \(so that  
higher valuations lead to a higher probability of allocation\)7 and cus-  
tomers with valuation zero have zero expected surplus in equilibrium.8  
Specifically, we have\:  
7Verifying that the allocations are increasing in the valuations may require analyzing  
monotonicity properties of the equilibrium strategy—that higher-valuation customers bid  
higher in equilibrium.  
8The requirement that customers with valuations zero have zero expected surplus is called a  
*participation constraint;* intuitively, it means we cannot force a customer to participate in an  
auction in which his expected surplus is negative. 258 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
THEOREM 6.1 *\[Revenue Equivalence Theorem\] Consider the private-*  
*value model, in which there are C items and N customers with i.i.d.*  
*valuation independently drawn from continuously differentiable, strictly*  
*increasing distribution F on Consider any mechanism in which*  
*\(i\) the allocation to customer is increasing in for all*  
*and \(ii\) customers with valuations of zero have zero expected surplus.*  
*Then the expected revenue for the firm is given by*  
*where*  
A proof of the this theorem is given in Appendix 6.A. Moreover, this  
revenue equivalence holds for the customers as well; a customer’s ex-  
pected payment is the same under all mechanisms satisfying the above  
conditions. However, the equivalence in both cases is only in expecta-  
tion; the payments on a sample-path basis may be quite different under  
different mechanisms.  
Note is precisely the marginal revenue function \(7.14\) encoun-  
tered in our analysis of revenue-maximizing prices in Chapter 7. This  
is not a coincidence; Bulow and Roberts \[95\] show the revenue function  
\(6.6\) can in fact be interpreted as a variant of third-degree monopoly  
price discrimination among the *N* customers \(see Section 8.3.3.2\).  
In auction theory, is sometimes referred to as customer *virtual*  
*value* because \(6.6\) implies that the firm can hope to collect only  
from customer \(in expectation\) and not his entire valuation The  
difference is referred to as the *information rent* of customer  
because it is the surplus that customer retains due to his private  
information about his own valuation  
As a result of Theorem 6.1, note that any two mechanisms that pro-  
duce the same allocation for every realization of \(the same  
customers are awarded units under each mechanism\) produce the same  
expected revenue for the firm. This is true despite the fact that the  
bidding strategies and payments may be very different under each mech-  
anism. For this reason, Theorem 6.1 is referred to as the *revenue equiv-*  
*alence theorem.*  
To illustrate, consider a standard first-price auction on a single unit.  
We saw in Section 6.2.2.2 that the equilibrium bidding strategy was  
strictly increasing in the value and that the item is awarded to the  
highest bidder. In a second-price auction, the customer with the highest *Auctions* 259  
valuation also wins that auction. Thus, by Theorem 6.1, the expected  
revenue to the firm must be the same in each case. We illustrate this  
result with a continuation of our previous example\:  
**Example 6.3** Suppose there are *N =* 2 customers with valuations uniformly distrib-  
uted on \[0,1\]. Let and From Example 6.2  
we know that in a first-price auction, the customers will bid in  
equilibrium. The highest bidder will win, and the firm’s expected revenue is  
Now consider a second-price auction of Example 6.1. The highest bidder wins but  
pays the price of the second-highest bid, and each customer bids his valuation in  
equilibrium. The firm’s expected revenue is  
Hence, the two expected revenues are equal. Moreover, note that since  
and therefore since in both auctions we have  
if and only if  
as well. Finally, for *N* \> 2 customers, the customer with valuation the same analysis shows that  
wins, and  
which is precisely the expected revenue found in Examples 6.1 and 6.2.  
Similarly, in a standard *C*-unit auction, one can show that both the  
first-price and second-price auctions award the goods to the customers  
with the *C* highest valuations. Thus, the allocation is the same  
for each and hence the two mechanisms generate the same expected  
revenue for the firm.  
**6.2.5 Optimal Auction Design**  
The revenue expression \(6.6\) can be used to design an optimal mech-  
anism by simply choosing the allocation rule **y**\*\(**v**\) that maximizes 260 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
subject to any constraints one might have on the allocation.  
Toward this end, it is useful to make the same regularity Assump-  
tion 7.2 on the distribution function *F* that we impose in dynamic pric-  
ing problems\: namely, that is strictly increasing in Note that  
where is the hazard rate of the distribution *F.* The marginal revenue  
satisfies this monotone condition as long as the hazard rate is  
increasing—or not decreasing too quickly with 9  
To illustrate, consider designing an optimal *C*-unit auction using \(6.6\).  
Note that with *C* units to allocate and given a realization of **v**, we want  
to maximize \(6.7\) subject to the constraint that  
and for all is by inspection. Indeed, define  
It is easy to see what the optimal allocation  
\(and by convention, if Then since *J \( . \)* is assumed  
to be increasing, it follows that it is never optimal to allocate a unit  
to a customer with valuation because awarding units to such  
customers results in a negative contribution to the sum \(6.7\). Among  
the remaining customers with we want to award units to those  
with the highest valuations Thus, the optimal allocation is to award  
units to the *C* highest-valuation customers above and if there  
are less than *C* customers with to award units only to those  
customers and discard the remaining units.  
How can we achieve such an allocation? One possibility is to introduce  
a *reserve price* into the standard first- or second-price *C*-unit auction  
mechanism. A reserve price is a lower bound on bids that the firm  
sets before the auction; only bids above the announced reserve price are  
considered.  
To illustrate, consider a first-price auction; it is easy to see that if  
we set a reserve price of customers with valuations will not  
submit bids. One can show that the remaining customers with valuations  
9More precisely, it is satisfied when for all One can show that this  
condition is satisfied by many standard distributions, including the uniform, normal, logistic,  
exponential, and extreme value \(double exponential\) distributions \[25\]. *Auctions* 261  
will submit bids according to an increasing equilibrium strategy  
similar to \(6.4\). Indeed, the resulting symmetric equilibrium strategy is  
now  
The *C* units are awarded to the *C* highest bids above the reserve price,  
and the resulting allocation is exactly the same as the optimal allocation.  
Hence, the first-price mechanism with reserve price is optimal. A  
similar argument holds for the second-price auction, in which case one  
can show that it is optimal to post a reserve price of where winners  
pay the minimum of the highest bid above or if there  
are fewer than *C +* 1 bids above We therefore have the following  
theorem\:  
THEOREM 6.2 *Under the private-value model, the standard C-unit first-*  
*price and second-price auctions with reserve price \(given by \(6.8\)\) are*  
*optimal for the firm.*  
Hence, with a properly chosen reserve price, the standard first-price and  
second-price auctions are revenue maximizing among all possible pricing  
mechanisms. This is a rather remarkable result; under the private-value  
model assumptions, a firm simply cannot do better than to sell using  
one of these two auction formats. Again, we illustrate this result by  
returning to our uniform-distribution example\:  
**Example 6.4** Suppose there are *N* customers with valuations uniformly distributed  
on \[0, 1\]. Since implies the optimal reserve price  
since this satisfies From \(6.9\), the customers with valuations over 1/2  
therefore bid  
which is strictly greater than the bid of submitted by these same customers  
in the first-price auction without reserve prices. Also, since the item is allocated to the  
highest-value customer and the distribution of the highest valuation is  
the firm’s optimal expected revenue is  
which is again larger than the expected revenue of \(*N –* 1\)/\(*N +* 1\) generated when no  
reserve prices are used but approaches the no-reserve-price revenue when *N* is large. 262 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The fact that a reserve price primarily benefits the firm most when  
there are few customers is intuitive. In essence, the reserve price serves to  
create “extra competition” for customers—forcing them to bid higher in  
a first-price auction or pay more if they win in a second-price auction—  
than they otherwise would without a reserve price. However, with lots  
of competition from other customers, the need for the firm to introduce  
this extra incentive is less important, as the customers themselves create  
sufficient competition.  
**6.2.6 Relationship to List Pricing**  
How is the optimal auction mechanism related to a traditional list-  
price mechanism? There are several close connections worth examining.  
First, note that a list-price mechanism qualifies as one of the possible  
allocation and payment mechanisms studied above for the *C*-unit auc-  
tion. In particular, using a fixed list price customers indicate their  
willingness to pay \(just as in an ascending auction\). If there are *C*  
or fewer customers willing to pay each receives a unit and pays the  
fixed amount if there are more than *C* customers willing to pay  
the *C* units are randomly rationed to these customers. This produces  
an allocation and payment rule just as in the standard auction types. In  
the list price case, it is easy to see that it is a dominant strategy for a  
customer to “bid” \(indicate his willingness to pay \) if his valuation is  
more than Thus, a dominant, symmetric equilibrium strategy exists  
in which all customers with valuations greater than attempt to buy.  
Given this observation, it is easy to compute the firm’s expected rev-  
enue. Let denote the number of customers with valuations greater  
than Then the expected revenue to the firm as a function of is  
Another way of deriving this revenue is to use the expression \(6.6\) for the  
firm’s equilibrium revenue and to note that for the list-price mechanism  
since units are allocated, and each customer to which  
we allocate a unit has a valuation so is  
the expected value of the corresponding term Using the fact that  
it is then a simple exercise to show that  
which gives us the same expression as \(6.10\).  
A direct optimization of \(6.10\) does not lead to a clean expression,  
but several special cases are simple and provide useful insight. We look  
at these next. *Auctions* 263  
**6.2.6.1 Capacity Is Unconstrained**  
The first case is where the number of customers so there are al-  
ways fewer customers than there are units. In this case,  
and the revenue for a list price of is  
Differentiating and setting the result equal to zero, we  
find that the optimal price satisfies  
But since \(*F* is strictly increasing\), rearranging this is equiv-  
alent to which is the condition for the revenue-maximizing  
price and is also the condition for determining the optimal reserve price.  
Thus, the optimal price when is the same as the optimal reserve  
price—that is, Moreover, the revenue under this optimal price  
can be written  
where expression have  
is the indicator function of the event But the  
above is simply the optimal  
auction revenue when is strictly increasing and Thus we  
PROPOSITION 6.1 *If capacity is not constrained in value auction then using a fixed list price satisfying*  
*is an optimal mechanism for the firm.*  
*C-unit, private-*  
**6.2.6.2 Large Capacity and Sales Volumes**  
Another case in which list pricing is provably good is when both the  
number of customers and the number of units for sale is large. Specifi-  
cally, let be a positive integer, and consider a problem with units  
and customers for some *N \> C \> 0.* If we set a fixed price of  
then the number of customers willing to purchase at this price is denoted  
with mean Moreover, by the law of large numbers,  
as  
and the firm’s revenue satisfies 264 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Just as in the capacity-constrained pricing problem of Section 5.2.1.2,  
the asymptotically optimal price is given by  
where is the revenue-maximizing price, determined by and  
is the run-out price, determined by equating the expected number of  
customers willing to pay to the supply *C,* so When  
the expected revenue is and when the expected  
revenue is  
Similarly, one can analyze the scaled optimal auction revenue. Note  
that the scaled expected optimal auction revenue can be written  
where denotes the largest valuations  
First, consider the case Then as with  
probability one So the above becomes  
which is exactly the asymptotic fixed-price revenue given by \(6.11\) when  
In the alternative case where as with  
probability one and similar reasoning shows that the  
which is again exactly the asymptotic fixed-price revenue given by \(6.11\)  
when These arguments can be formalized to show  
PROPOSITION 6.2 *If the number of customers and the number of units*  
*for sale in the private-value auction model are, respectively, and* *Auctions* 265  
*for some integers and N \> C \>* 0. *Then as a list-*  
*price mechanism is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that the ratio of*  
*the optimal expected list price revenue to the optimal expected auction*  
*revenue tends to one.*  
As a result, in high-sales-volume settings, using a fixed price will be  
near optimal. This implies auction benefits are something of a “small-  
numbers” phenomenon, which is consistent with the auctions one en-  
counters in practice.  
**6.2.6.3 Dynamic Pricing**  
Another close connection between auctions and list-price mechanisms  
is obtained by considering a dynamic pricing policy as a particular alloca-  
tion and payment mechanism in a private-value auction model. Making  
this connection yields several important insights.  
For example, consider the problem of selling a single unit to a pop-  
ulation of *N* strategic consumers. As in the price-skimming model of  
Section 5.5.2, the private-value model considers the *N* customers to have  
i.i.d. private valuations for the item. The Dutch-auction mechanism  
calls for the firm to continuously reduce the price over time until a cus-  
tomer decides to bid at the offered price. The customer then pays this  
offered price. However, this is precisely what happens in a \(continuous-  
time\) dynamic pricing policy as well, so a descending dynamic price can  
effectively achieve the Dutch-auction outcome. By simply adding an op-  
timal reserve price below which we will not lower the price, such a  
dynamic pricing mechanism becomes optimal.  
More generally, by the revenue equivalence theorem, *any* dynamic  
pricing policy that results in the *C* highest-valuation customers, with  
valuations in excess of receiving the units, will be revenue-maximizing  
for the firm and thus produce the same expected revenue as the optimal  
auction.  
For example, Bulow and Klemperer \[94\] analyze the *C*-unit, private-  
value model under a dynamic pricing mechanism. In their mechanism,  
the firm uses a list price that is lowered continuously until one or more  
customers offers to buy at the current price. If the number of customers  
willing to buy at the current price is less than the remaining supply, these  
customers are awarded the items at this price, and the firm continues to  
lower the price. If the number of customers willing to pay the current  
price exceeds the remaining supply, the firm does not sell the items;  
it instead increases the price discontinuously and then tries again to  
lower the price. Since a customer’s probability of getting an item is  
higher when he attempts to buy early \(if he attempts to buy and fails, 266 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
he can always try again later, so his probability of obtaining the item  
cannot decrease by attempting to buy early\), it is not hard to show that  
customers with the highest valuations are the ones that attempt to buy  
first. Therefore, the firm allocates the items first to the customers with  
the highest valuation. As a result, Bulow and Klemperer \[94\] argue that  
by revenue equivalence, if the firm does not lower the price below  
this dynamic pricing mechanism is optimal. Similar arguments hold for  
many other dynamic pricing policies as well.  
This shows there is a rather close connection between optimal auc-  
tion theory and dynamic pricing theory with strategic consumers. In-  
deed, using the revenue equivalence theorem, the seemingly difficult task  
of analyzing the customer equilibrium produced by a dynamic pricing  
strategy is greatly simplified, and it shows in fact that a range of pricing  
mechanisms are optimal.  
**6.2.7 Departures from the Independent**  
# Private-Value Model  
Many of our conclusions thus far depend to a greater or lesser extent  
on the assumptions of the independent, private-value model. What hap-  
pens when these assumptions are relaxed? In this section, we look briefly  
at a few cases that are especially relevant for RM. Each has implications  
for the types of auctions that are optimal for the firm.  
**6.2.7.1 The Common-Value Model**  
The private-value model assumes that each customer’s valuation is  
independent of the valuations of other customers. Thus, if a customer  
learns the value that another customer places on the item, it has no  
impact on his valuation. Such an assumption is reasonable if the item  
is going to be used for personal enjoyment or consumption. However,  
in other cases the item may have a common commercial value, may be  
resold at some future point in time, or may be of uncertain quality, so  
the valuations others have on the item could reveal useful information  
about the value of the item to a given customer.  
A canonical example of such a setting is selling an offshore oil lease.  
The value of the lease to a customer is dependent on two key factors\: the  
volume of oil it contains and the cost of extracting that oil. Typically,  
there is a high degree of uncertainty about both these factors. Because of  
differences in survey data or technological expertise, different customers  
may have independent information on the value of a given lease, and so  
on. As a result, knowing how another customer values the lease may  
change your assessment of its profitability. *Auctions* 267  
A simple model of such a setting is the following\: consider auctioning  
a single item that has a *common value* which is the same for all  
customers. However, the value is uncertain. All customers have the  
same prior knowledge of embodied as a distribution over values of  
This distribution is common knowledge. A value of is drawn from this  
distribution, and then each customer receives a \(noisy\) signal of the  
form  
where are i.i.d. random-noise terms with mean zero. The  
distribution of is also common knowledge.  
Note that given only the signal customer expected value for the  
item is  
with variance given by the variance of However, if one were to aggre-  
gate the customers’ signals by averaging them, the estimate would be  
which provides a much better \(lower variance\) information  
on the value than do the signals alone.10 More generally, customer  
estimate of may be altered by information he receives about the  
signals of other customers. This sort of behavior significantly affects the  
auction outcomes.  
For example, one phenomenon that arises in this setting is the so-  
called *winner’s curse.* To illustrate the idea, consider a sealed-bid,  
second-price auction. Suppose customer were to bid his expected  
valuation for the item, as in the private-value case. The customer  
might \(incorrectly\) reason that bidding his own expected valuation is  
a dominant strategy because bidding more than increases his chance  
of winning only in cases where his expected surplus is negative, and bid-  
ding less than decreases his chances of winning only in cases where his  
expected surplus is positive. The reasoning is false, however, because  
customer expected valuation conditional on winning the auction is  
less than his unconditional expected valuation Indeed,  
since \(provided that has nonzero  
probability of exceeding its mean zero\).  
Intuitively, winning should indicate to customer that his noise term  
is the largest and therefore his initial estimate is upwardly biased.  
Therefore, if he were to bid his unconditional estimate winning the  
10For example, the variance of the aggregate signal the variance of  
is a factor smaller than 268 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
auction would indeed be bad news. It would indicate his expected sur-  
plus was negative; hence the *winner’s curse.* To overcome this “curse,”  
a rational customer must adjust his bid downward, considering the fact  
that it is the expected valuation of the item conditioned on having the  
highest signal that matters in determining his winnings.  
The tendency of customers to reduce their bids to avoid the winner’s  
curse changes the revenue equivalence of the basic auction types. In  
particular, while the sealed-bid auction conveys no information to cus-  
tomers, the Dutch \(open descending price\) and English \(open ascending  
price\) auctions provides them some information because they can ob-  
serve how many customers are still willing—or not willing—to buy at  
the current price, when each drops out, and so on. The information  
about other customers’ valuations tends to reduce the negative impact  
of the winner’s curse.  
For example, when an item has a common-value component, one can  
show the firm is better off using an English \(open ascending price\) auc-  
tion than a sealed-bid, second-price auction—auctions that are strategi-  
cally equivalent under the private-value model. Moreover, one can show  
that if the firm has its own signal \(some private information\) positively  
correlated with the item’s value \(like past price data of similar items  
or an appraisal\), it benefits by sharing that information with the cus-  
tomers. This is because customers will tend to increase their estimate of  
the item’s value as a result and bid more aggressively. Reserve prices also  
benefit the firm, but unlike in the private-value case, the optimal reserve  
price may vary with the type of auction and the number of customers.  
**6.2.7.2 Risk Aversion**  
Another factor affecting the results of the independent, private-value  
model is the assumption that both the firm and customer are risk-  
neutral. \(See Appendix E for a discussion of risk preferences.\) While the  
assumption of risk neutrality for a firm is often reasonable \(for example,  
when the firm is a large, participating in many auctions over time\), the  
assumption of risk neutrality for individual consumers is typically less  
realistic. However, it is easy to determine the relative performance of  
the standard auction types under risk aversion.  
First, consider the case where the firm is risk-neutral and the cus-  
tomers are risk-averse. By revenue equivalence, note that a customer  
expected payment conditioned on his valuation being the high-  
est is the same under the first- and second-price auctions, since this  
expected payment is simply the expected revenue to the firm. How-  
ever, the customer who wins a first-price auction pays a certain amount  
while the same customer in a second-price auction will pay an *Auctions* 269  
uncertain amount with the same mean—namely, the valuation of the  
second-highest customer conditioned on the fact that is the highest  
valuation. Thus, a risk-averse customer will prefer the first-price auc-  
tion to the second-price auction. Given this preference, in the first-price  
auction risk-averse customers will tend to increase their bids above the  
risk-neutral equilibrium bid \(Bidding one’s own valuation is still  
a dominant strategy under risk aversion in the second-price auction, so  
the bidding strategy in this case is not affected.\) The higher resulting  
equilibrium bids in the first-price auction mean that the firm’s expected  
revenue is higher as well, so the firm prefers this auction format.  
Now consider the opposite case, where the firm is risk-averse and the  
customers are risk-neutral. By the same reasoning as above, the firm’s  
revenue in the first-price auction conditioned on the winning value being  
is certain while in the second-price auction it is uncertain. Therefore,  
unconditioning on the revenue in the second-price auction is more  
variable as well—also with the same mean as in the first-price auction.  
Thus, a risk-averse firm will also prefer the first-price auction.  
The fact that the firm prefers the first-price auction in both cases \(and  
is no worse in the second-price auction if all parties are risk-neutral\) has  
been offered as one explanation for the relative popularity of first-price  
auctions over second-price auctions in practice.  
**6.2.7.3 Asymmetry Among Customers**  
Yet another departure from the private-value model is to relax the  
assumption of symmetry. The simplest case is to assume that there  
are two types of customers, types 1 and 2, with different valuations for  
the item drawn from different distributions, denoted and  
with corresponding marginal revenue \(virtual value\) functions and  
For example, type 1 customers may be experienced customers,  
and type 2 customers may be novice customers, or type 1 customers may  
be individuals while type 2 are industrial customers.  
To see what can happen in this case, assume the first customers  
are of type 1 and the next are of type 2, and assume the marginal  
revenue functions are both increasing. The optimal allocation for the  
firm is obtained by maximizing 270 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
subject to the constraint that the total allocation is one  
As before, it is optimal to allocate the item to the customer with the  
highest marginal value. However, note since and may differ,  
the customer with the highest marginal value is not necessarily the one  
with the highest valuation  
This has important consequences for the optimal auction. For exam-  
ple, it means that it can be optimal for the firm to set different reserve  
prices for different types of customers, and the firm may systematically  
favor one class of customers over another in awarding the item. Indeed,  
one can show that in certain cases, it is optimal for the firm to favor  
the type of customers that tend to value the item less. The rationale for  
this is that by favoring these low-value types, the firm encourages the  
high-value types to bid even higher. The resulting higher equilibrium  
bids it receives from the high-value types more than compensates the  
firm for the loss he occasionally takes in favoring the low-value types.  
In other words, it is optimal for the firm to *discriminate* among cus-  
tomers in the offering terms for the auction. This behavior is similar to  
the classical third-degree price-discrimination policy of offering different  
prices to different customer groups based on their different willingness  
to pay. \(See Section 8.3.3.1.\)  
**6.2.7.4 Collusion**  
The private-value model assumes the firm defines a game among the  
customers, intended to extract the highest prices possible from them. A  
key assumption in this game is that customers do not cooperate. Yet in  
practice, there is the possibility of *collusion* among customers, in which  
a coalition of customers \(popularly called a *bidding ring*\) cooperates and  
agrees to submit bids that are designed to reduce the price paid by the  
winner. Such collusion has been reported, for example, in the awarding  
of some government contracts.  
There are several practical devices to reduce the likelihood of col-  
lusion among customers, most of which involve reducing the ability of  
customers to communicate among themselves. For example, one tech-  
nique is to keep the identity of all customers secret, so customers cannot  
identify each other and form a bidding ring. \(Though this may fail  
if the number of potential customers is so small that most customers  
know, *a priori,* the pool of likely participants—such as major suppliers  
in a procurement auction\). Another technique is to reduce the amount *Auctions* 271  
of information relayed about bids to the minimum necessary to conduct  
the auction. For example, the firm might report only the highest current  
bid in an ascending auction, not the number of bids received, the time  
bids were received, or the history of bid values. This prevents customers  
from using such data to “signal” their intentions to each other.11  
Because collusion can take so many forms, it is difficult to make  
general recommendations on the firm’s “optimal response” to collusion.  
Nevertheless, to give some sense of the effect that it has consider a case  
where all *N* customers in the private-value model can collude perfectly.  
That is, they can get together and agree to submit bids, make payments,  
and allocate the item among themselves to maximize the surplus they  
receive as a group. In this case, the group of *N* customers effectively  
acts as a single “big customer” with valuation  
with distribution  
where *F*\(·\) is the distribution of the valuations for the *N* customers with  
density The marginal value for this distribution is  
Of course, when faced with a single customer, the optimal auction is still  
the usual one\: conduct a first or second-price auction with a reserve price  
set according to the marginal value of the single customer. So assuming  
is increasing, the firm should set a reserve price satisfying  
In this case, the bidding ring will be forced \(yet willing\) to pay when  
its maximum valuation, is at least this large. Also, one can show that  
this optimal reserve price is higher than the noncooperative optimal  
reserve price and that it increases with the number of customers *N* in  
the coalition. Thus, the possibility of collusion creates an incentive to  
use higher reserve prices than when customers do not collude. Indeed,  
the desire to thwart collusion is one of the main motivations for using  
reserve prices in practice.  
11For example, at a keynote address to the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications  
\(IMA\) in December 2000, Robert Weber reported an instance in which bidders in a auction  
used the least significant digits in their bid amounts as a signaling mechanism. To overcome  
this, the auctioneer imposed larger minimum bid increments, thus reducing—or at least  
raising the cost of—this sort of signaling. 272 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**6.3 Optimal Dynamic Single-Resource Capacity**  
# Auctions  
We next consider a dynamic auction problem that is in essence the  
auction equivalent of the single-resource problem of Chapter 2. In con-  
trast to the traditional auction problem, in this case the firm receives  
bids from *T* groups of customers who are separated over time. In par-  
ticular, in each period we assume that a new set of customers arrives  
and bids for the remaining capacity. The firm must determine winners  
in period before observing the bids \(or even the number of customers\)  
in future periods. This dynamic feature parallels the traditional RM  
model, in which the firm must determine the capacity to sell in a given  
period before observing demand in future periods.  
Such separation of customers over time is common in RM practice, a  
canonical example being the airline industry. Leisure travelers typically  
make travel plans months in advance of departure because they fre-  
quently must coordinate their vacation travel with other arrangements,  
like reserving resort accommodations, taking time off work or finding  
child care, and so on. In contrast, business travelers may not even know  
of their need to travel until a few days in advance of departure. As a  
result, if an airline were to conduct a single auction months in advance  
of departure, they would likely lose many business travelers; if they con-  
ducted a single auction a week before departure, they would likely lose  
many leisure travelers. This creates an incentive for them to conduct  
auctions at multiple points in time.  
Other industries face similar situations, in which customers’ needs are  
realized at different points of time \(the need to buy a gift for a birthday,  
for example\)—or are based on other contingent events \(a new order  
to a manufacturer triggering a need for new supplies\) that effectively  
separate customers in time. In such situations, a firm attempting to use  
a single auction at a single point in time would find itself eliminating  
many potential customers. By conducting multiple auctions over time,  
it can reach a larger pool of customers.  
We next look at the optimal auction-design problem for this dynamic  
auction setting. We also compare the optimal auction to a traditional  
RM mechanism based on using dynamic list prices and capacity controls.  
**6.3.1 Formulation**  
A firm has an initial capacity of *C* units of a good that it wants to  
sell over a finite time horizon *T*. It does this by conducting a sequence  
of auctions indexed by *Auctions* 273  
Customers are separated in time. In period risk-neutral potential  
customers arrive. is a nonnegative, discrete-valued random variable  
distributed according to a known p.m.f. with support \{0,..., *M*\}  
for some *M* \> 0 and strictly positive first moment.  
The assumptions parallel the private-value model\: Each customer  
wishes to purchase at most one unit and has a reservation value  
When the context is clear, we omit the time index and  
write Reservation values are private information, i.i.d. samples from  
a distribution *F*\(·\), which, as in the private-value model, is assumed  
strictly increasing with a continuous density function on the sup-  
port with and To simplify notation and  
subsequent analysis, we assume that the distribution functions and  
*F* do not depend on the time but the extension to time-dependent  
distributions is straightforward.  
The distributions *F* and are assumed common knowledge to the firm  
and all potential customers \(although this assumption can be relaxed for  
the second-price mechanism below\). In addition, customer knows his  
own \(private\) valuation Without loss of generality we assume that  
the unit salvage value for the firm at time is  
The firm's problem is to design an auction mechanism that maximizes  
its expected revenue. To do so, it must solve for an optimal allocation  
in each period, given the values of in each period and knowing  
only the probabilistic information \(distributions\) of these values in future  
periods.  
Define the value function as the maximum expected revenue  
obtainable from periods given that there are units in  
period Using \(6.6\) for the expected revenue in each period, the Bell-  
man equation for in terms of the allocation variables can be  
written  
where conditions are  
is the total number of units awarded in period The boundary  
where *C* denotes the initial capacity. An allocation that achieves the  
maximum above given and will be an optimal dynamic allocation  
policy. \(See Appendix D.\) 274 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**6.3.2 Optimal Dynamic Allocations and**  
# Mechanisms  
We first analyze the theoretical properties of the dynamic program  
\(6.12\)–\(6.13\). From this structure, one can show that variants of the  
classic first- and second-price auctions are optimal for this problem.  
**6.3.2.1 Optimal Allocations**  
As in the traditional single-resource RM model, the solution of the  
dynamic program \(6.12\)–\(6.13\) hinges on the monotonicity of the mar-  
ginal values Indeed, one can show the  
following \[542\]\:  
PROPOSITION 6.3 *is decreasing in for any fixed and is de-*  
*creasing in for any fixed*  
These are quite natural economic properties. At any point in time,  
the marginal benefit of each additional unit declines because the future  
number of customers is limited; therefore, the chance of selling the mar-  
ginal unit—and the expected revenue if we sell it—decreases. Similarly,  
for any given remaining quantity the marginal benefit of an addi-  
tional unit decreases with because as time progresses, the number of  
future customers declines; therefore, the chance of selling the marginal  
unit—and the expected revenue if we sell it—goes down.  
Proposition 6.3 simplifies the optimal allocation. To see this, note  
that since *J*\(·\) is assumed to be increasing, if the firm decides to award  
units, it is optimal to allocate them to the highest \(that is, to  
the highest Therefore, define  
and note that  
Also, define be rewritten in terms of Then the formulation \(6.12\) can  
as follows\:  
where the sum is defined to be 0 if Let be the optimal solution  
above \(the optimal number of bids to accept\) at time in state *Auctions* 275  
Let denote a realization of the random variable and be a  
realization of customers’ types. The following proposition characterizes  
the optimal allocation and follows from \(6.15\) and Proposition 6.3\:  
PROPOSITION 6.4 *For any realization units to allocate in state is given by*  
*the optimal number of*  
*if and by otherwise. Moreover, it is optimal to*  
*award these units to those customers with the highest valuations*  
This shows how the firm should run the auction—provided it can in-  
fer the valuations of the customers. In particular, note that  
for so the decision rule in Proposition 6.4  
about the optimal number of bids to accept is simply based on sorting  
the values and progressively awarding items to the highest-value cus-  
tomers until drops below the marginal opportunity cost  
The situation is illustrated in Figure 6.3. Thus, given the customer 276 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
valuations and the value function the optimal allocation rule  
is simple.  
**6.3.2.2 Optimal Mechanisms**  
We next demonstrate that appropriately modified versions of two  
standard procedures—the first- and the second-price auctions—achieve  
the optimal dynamic allocation.  
**Second-price auction** In a straightforward application of the second-  
price mechanism in the dynamic auction setting, it is no longer optimal  
for customers to bid their valuation. The following informal reasoning  
shows why. Suppose it is optimal to bid truthfully under the second-price  
mechanism and let  
The thresholds are directly computable from the solution of \(6.23\) de-  
scribed in the previous section, which uses common knowledge informa-  
tion, and are in principle known to all customers and the firm. Following  
Theorem 6.4, the firm will accept bid as long as Now sup-  
pose the firm decides to award units. That means  
and However, if the first loser, had bid  
instead \(which in fact verifies the firm would  
include him among the winners and award units, and the customer  
would pay only and make a positive profit. Hence, customers have  
some incentive to bid above their own valuations \(a pure second-price  
mechanism fails to elicit truthful bids\).  
However, the following modification to the second-price mechanism  
avoids this pitfall. In each period the firm first computes the thresholds  
using the current capacity Given the vector of submitted bids **b**,  
the firm will award units, where  
and if and all winners will pay  
where is the highest bid and is the threshold to award  
the unit. Ties between bids are broken by randomization. For sim-  
plicity we refer to \(6.17\)-\(6.18\) as the *modified second-price* mechanism.  
One can then show the following result \[542\]\:  
PROPOSITION 6.5 *For the modified second-price auction with allocation*  
*and payments given by \(6.17\)-\(6.18\), customer’s dominant strategy* *Auctions* 277  
*is to bid his own valuation. Moreover, under this dominant-strategy*  
*equilibrium, the modified second-price mechanism is optimal.*  
**First-Price auction** In a first-price auction, items are awarded to the  
highest bidders, and winners pay their bids. This type of mechanism  
may be more natural in many applications.  
To establish that the first-price auction achieves the same expected  
revenue as the second-price mechanism described above, one needs to  
show that \(1\) items are again awarded according to the optimal allo-  
cation rule derived in the previous section and \(2\) customers with zero  
value have zero expected surplus. To do this, it suffices to show that  
there exists a symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy that is strictly  
increasing in the customer’s valuation. In this case, the firm can use this  
bid function to invert a bid and infer the customer’s valuation, which it  
can then use to correctly compute the number of items to award.  
The main result for this case is the following \[542\]\:  
PROPOSITION 6.6 *Under the first-price auction, there exists a symmet-*  
*ric, strictly increasing, bidding strategy equilibrium The strategy*  
*depends on the current values of and as given by*  
*where the winners,*  
*is the probability that a customer with valuation is among*  
*and by convention*  
*Moreover, under this symmetric equilibrium, the first-price auction is*  
*optimal.*  
Note that \(6.19\) shows—since winners are required to pay what they  
bid—that under a first-price mechanism customers shade their valua-  
tions to make some positive surplus. Since is strictly increasing,  
the units are sold to the players with the highest valuations. Moreover,  
once the firm observes bids it can calculate the valuations  
through the well-defined inverse bidding function  
An important practical observation from this result is that the opti-  
mal first-price mechanism is not greedy, in the sense that it does not 278 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
maximize the sum of *observable* revenue in the current period plus the  
expected revenue to go, because the firm compares the values of  
with the marginal value rather than with the bids themselves.  
As a result, the firm may \(1\) accept bids below the marginal value when  
and \(2\) reject bids that are above  
marginal value when Numerical  
experiments show that both cases may occur.  
This behavior is somewhat counterintuitive because at first blush is  
seems that any bid that exceeds the marginal value of capacity ought  
to be worth accepting. However, such reasoning neglects the effect that  
the acceptance policy has on the bidding strategy of the customers. If  
the firm accepts all bids that are *ex post* profitable, then customers end  
up bidding *less* in equilibrium than they do when the firm follows the  
optimal acceptance strategy. The net result is to lower the firm's total  
revenue. In short, the firm has to occasionally refuse profitable bids to  
induce the customers to bid more aggressively—and in equilibrium it  
benefits by taking these short-run losses. This is simply an extension of  
the rationale for using reserve prices in a standard auction.  
**6.3.3 Comparisons with Traditional RM**  
We next compare the optimal auction mechanisms with a variation of  
a traditional quantity-based RM mechanism as in Chapter 2. The firm  
sets a list price at the beginning of each period and calculates a threshold  
on the number of units it is willing to award at the list price. Both the  
price and the capacity limit are optimized. We call this mechanism  
the *dynamic list price, capacity-controlled mechanism* \(DLPCC\). Note  
that unlike in a traditional RM mechanism, in DLPCC prices are set  
optimally rather than being given exogenously.  
Customers who are interested in acquiring one unit at that list price  
submit *acceptances* \(an offer to buy\). If the number of acceptances ex-  
ceeds the capacity limit set by the firm, the units are randomly rationed  
to the customers. It is easy to see in this case that a dominant strategy  
for customers is to submit an acceptance if and only if their valuations  
exceed the firm’s reserve price.  
**6.3.3.1 Theoretical Comparisons**  
One can show that the DLPCC mechanism is, in fact, optimal in  
several cases. Indeed, we have \[542\]  
PROPOSITION 6.7 *The DLPCC is optimal if the following cases\:*  
*\(i\) There is at most one customer per period*  
*\(ii\) There are more units to sell than there are potential customers* *Auctions* 279  
*\(iii\) Asymptotically as the number of customers and units to sell grows*  
*large*  
That is, unless customers can be aggregated in time, the number of  
customers and objects is not too large, and there is some scarcity, there  
is no advantage to using a bidding mechanism over simple list pricing.  
These results are analogous to those in Section 6.2.6 for the single-period  
auction.  
**6.3.3.2 Numerical Comparisons**  
We next consider some numerical examples that illustrate the con-  
ditions under which an optimal pricing mechanism significantly out-  
performs DLPCC. In the examples that follow, the dynamic program  
associated with the optimal mechanism is solved using simulation, and  
customers’ valuations are assumed to be uniformly distributed.  
The first experiment shows how the revenue changes as the *concen-*  
*tration of customers,* defined as the number of customers per period,  
is varied. The firm starts with *C* = 16 units, and the total number of  
customers in all periods is constant at 64. The number of periods varies  
from 1 to 64, so that the number of customers per period varies. That is,  
the example runs from 64 customers in one period \(high concentration  
of customers\) to one customer in each of 64 consecutive periods \(low  
concentration of customers\).  
The results are given in Table 6.1. Observe that the optimal revenue  
increases as the concentration of customers increases. This is intuitive,  
since as the firm observes more customers’ valuations per period, it is  
making allocation decisions with reduced uncertainty about future bid  
values. Moreover, an increase in concentration increases direct bidding  
competition amongst customers. The gap reaches over 6% in the ex-  
treme case of a single period with 64 customers, which is significant.  
The second experiment compares the suboptimality gaps of the DLPCC  
mechanism under various levels of capacity and demand. The number of  
periods is kept constant at *T =* 5\. The number of customers per period  
is fixed at 30, 50 and 100; and for each of these, three choices  
of capacity–*C* = 0.1 *T C =* 0.3 *T* and *C =* 0.5 T —are used.  
Results are shown in Table 6.2. The gaps for DLPCC tend to decrease  
from left to right \(which corresponds to increasing the capacity to de-  
mand ratio\) and from top to bottom \(which corresponds to increasing  
proportional number of customers per period and number of units in  
stock\) in each table. Note that the gaps of 2% or more occur only in the 280 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
case where the number of customers is moderate \(such as 10\) and the  
capacity is constrained  
Other numerical experiments of \[542\] show that the relative benefit of  
the dynamic auction increase as the variance in the customer’s reserva-  
tion value increases and as the variance in the number of customers  
increases. Hence, variability in the demand environment appears to  
favor the use of a dynamic auction mechanism.  
# 6.4 Optimal Dynamic Auctions with  
# Replenishment  
We next consider an infinite-horizon auction problem with replenish-  
ment, which is essentially the auction equivalent of the dynamic pricing  
and inventory problem of Section 5.3.2. A firm orders, stores, and then  
sells units of a homogeneous good over an infinite time horizon. The  
firm starts a period with an initial \(integral\) inventory and it reorders  
at a unit cost at the end of the period. Replenishment orders arrive  
instantly, and we do not allow backlogging. In each period, a convex, *Auctions* 281  
strictly increasing holding cost of is charged on the starting inven-  
tory level 12  
The firm sells its goods through a sequence of auctions indexed by  
The problem is assumed to be stationary, so the statistics of demand  
are the same for all periods Private-value assumptions apply. In each  
period, *N* risk-neutral customers arrive. *N* is a nonnegative, discrete-  
valued random variable distributed according to a known probability  
mass function with support \[0, *M*\] for some *M \>* 0 and with a  
strictly positive first moment. Each customer requires one unit and  
has a private valuation i.i.d. with a distribution *F*\(·\),  
which is strictly increasing with a continuous-density function on  
the support We assume that the marginal value *J*\(·\) derived from  
*F*\(·\) is strictly increasing.  
As in the single-resource capacity auction case, we use **v** both for  
the random vector of valuations \(from the firm’s perspective\) and for a  
particular realization. The distribution functions and *F* are constant  
through time and are assumed common knowledge to the firm and  
all potential customers. We assume that both the number of customers  
*N* and their valuations **v** are independent from one period to the next.  
Thus, each period is an independent draw of *N* and **v**.  
The firm’s problem is to design an auction mechanism and find a  
replenishment policy that maximizes its expected discounted profit. As  
before, we analyze this by first finding an optimal allocation and then  
finding mechanisms that achieve the optimal allocation.  
**6.4.1 Dynamic Programming Formulation**  
We analyze this problem using a dynamic programming formulation  
in terms of allocation variables Define the value function  
as the maximum expected discounted profit given an initial inventory  
which satisfies the Bellman’s equation\:  
12One can also analyze the case where holding cost is charged on the ending inventory level.  
The results are qualitatively the same as long as the holding cost is linear. 282 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where is the discount factor, is the total number of units  
awarded, and is the replenishment order for the next period. Note  
from first principles that the state space can be bounded by *M* because  
at most *M* customers will arrive in any period, and since we can reorder  
at the end of every period, there is no need to stock more than *M.*  
Our objective is finding an optimal stationary policy consisting of an  
allocation **y**\(·\) and a replenishment order that achieves  
Assuming *J*\(·\) is monotone increasing \(Assumption 7.2\), it again fol-  
lows that if the firm allocates units, it is optimal to allocate them to  
the highest \(to the highest So, as before, define  
and note that is a random function that solves  
Therefore, we can rewrite \(6.21\) in terms of as follows\:  
Note that above we are assuming that excess stock can be eliminated  
without cost \(*free disposal*\) when This assumption is not  
essential for the analysis, but it helps to simplify the notation.  
**6.4.2 Optimal Auction and Replenishment Policy**  
We next characterize the optimal auction and replenishment policy for  
this problem. The first statement is presented in algorithmic form \[527\]\:  
PROPOSITION 6.8 *Consider the inventory-pricing problem described*  
*in \(6.23\). Define the optimal base-stock level by*  
*Then the optimal stationary policy is to allocate units to customers and*  
*replenish stock as follows\:* *Auctions* 283  
# STEP 1 \(Allocate units\)\:  
*FOR \(i\) and*  
*\(ii\) and*  
*ELSE GOTO STEP 2.*  
*allocate the unit if either\:*  
# STEP 2 \(Replenish stock\)\:  
*IF then order up to i.e., ELSE order*  
*nothing*  
The policy says that while the current inventory is above the optimal  
base-stock level \(case \(i\)\), then we will award the unit if the benefit  
from accepting the bid \(its virtual value exceeds the profit  
of keeping the unit for the next period less the marginal holding cost  
for keeping it. The unit is not replenished in this case. Once the  
inventory reaches the optimal level \(case \(ii\)\), the firm awards a unit  
as long as the benefit from accepting a bid exceeds the cost of replacing  
the unit awarded; each such unit is replenished. This policy is illustrated  
in Figure 6.4.  
An interesting result of this allocation policy is that when the inven-  
tory is less than the optimal base-stock level the firm can achieve the  
optimal allocation by simply running a standard first-price or second-  
price auction in each period with a fixed reserve price  
Indeed, the following characterization of the optimal policy in this  
case \[527\]\:  
PROPOSITION 6.9 *Once the inventory reaches units, the optimal pol-*  
*icy in all subsequent periods is to \(i\) run a standard first- or second-price*  
*auction with fixed reserve price and then \(ii\) at the end of each*  
*period, order up to the optimal base-stock level*  
Since the problem is over an infinite horizon and the optimal policy  
calls only for ordering when the inventory drops below the firm even-  
tually reaches a point where the above simple auction and replenishment  
policy are optimal for all remaining time. That is, is the unique re-  
current state in the resulting Markov chain that governs the evolution  
of the inventory over time under the optimal policy.  
This result is significant on several levels. First, it shows that the  
classical first-price and second-price mechanisms remain optimal in the 284 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
dynamic-inventory setting. These are both familiar auction mechanisms,  
which are easy for customers to understand and easy for firms to imple-  
ment. The inventory-replenishment policy is also a familiar and simple  
base-stock policy. This combination makes the optimal policy quite prac-  
tical. On a theoretical level, the result is as simple as one could hope  
for in this setting. Finally, it is convenient as well from a computational  
perspective because it reduces the optimal policy to a search over the  
single parameter as we show next.  
**6.4.3 Average-Profit Criterion**  
Consider maximizing the long-run average profit. One can show that  
the optimal policy for the problem is in fact Blackwell op-  
timal;13 that is, it is simultaneously optimal for all discounted problems  
with discount factors for some As a result, one  
can show \(see \[527\]\) that the optimal average-profit policy will again be  
to run a standard first-price or second-price auction in each period with  
13See Bertsekas \[57, Section 4.2, Definition 1.1\]\) for a formal definition of Blackwell optimality. *Auctions* 285  
reserve price and then order up to a fixed base-stock level  
at the end of each period.  
Indeed, because of this fact, one can develop a simple procedure for  
finding the optimal base-stock level Let  
be the average profit when following a policy of reordering up to a fixed  
base-stock level We know that such a policy will be optimal for some  
therefore, we simply need to search for a value that maximizes  
In fact, one can verify that the profit function is concave in and  
that can be evaluated by simulation and in special cases  
by closed-form expressions. Taking advantage of the concavity of  
a binary search over the range for therefore gives an overall algorithm  
complexity of *O*\(*N* log *M*\). Henceforth, we denote the optimal objective  
value  
**6.4.4 Comparison with a List-Price Mechanism**  
We next consider how the optimal auction policy compares with a  
traditional, fixed-price policy. Specifically, we consider the base-stock,  
list price policy of Section 5.3.2, in which the firm sets a fixed list price  
in each period and then replenishes by ordering up to a fixed base-stock  
level To be consistent, we assume we incur the holding cost at the  
beginning of the period, and we assume customers who are interested  
in acquiring one unit at the posted price submit acceptances. If the  
number of acceptances exceeds the current inventory of the firm, we  
randomly ration the units to the customers. It is easy to see that under  
this pricing mechanism, a dominant strategy for customers is to submit  
an acceptance if and only if their own valuations are higher than the list  
price.  
We compare the profits earned under the optimal mechanism with  
those under the base-stock, list-price mechanism for an optimal choice  
of and We give theoretical comparisons first, followed by a numerical  
comparison of the two policies.  
**6.4.4.1 Theoretical Comparisons**  
We restrict ourselves to the average-cost case, where the optimal profit  
is given by optimizing \(6.25\) over though similar results can be devel-  
oped for the discounted case. One can show the following \[527\]\:  
PROPOSITION 6.10 *The base-stock, list price policy is optimal when*  
*\(i\) The number of customers is at most with probability* 286 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
*one.*  
*\(ii\) The number of customers is large, linear,*  
*\(iii\) The holding cost is zero,*  
*and the holding cost is*  
Part \(i\) shows that if the firm is receiving isolated bids \(as in some  
consumer online auctions, such as Priceline.com’s mechanism\), there is  
no inherent advantage to using auctions over list pricing. Some aggrega-  
tion of customers is needed to gain a strict advantage through an auction  
mechanism. Intuitively, this is because one needs to generate some bid-  
ding competition among customers to realize a benefit from an auction.  
With at most one customer bidding, there is no competition. Part \(ii\) is  
analogous to the finite-horizon problem. As the number of customers in  
each period becomes large, the fraction with valuations above any given  
price converges to a deterministic function of and hence the ratio  
of the auction and the fixed-price revenues tends to one. The intuitive  
reason for part \(iii\) is that with no holding cost, the firm will stock the  
maximum inventory *M* at the start of each period under both the op-  
timal auction and list price policies. As a result, there is no rationing  
of product, and thus customers do not face any bidding competition.  
Without bidding competition, the auction produces the same profits as  
the base-stock, list price policy.  
**6.4.4.2 Numerical Comparisons**  
We next present the results of some numerical simulations from \[527\]  
with the average-profit criterion. The following base case is used as a  
starting point. The ordering cost is normalized at customers’  
valuations are assumed uniform of width centered at \(that  
is, customers’ valuations are centered at the cost, with representing  
the dispersion in valuations\); there are a constant *N* = 50 customers  
per period; and the holding cost is linear of the form where  
is the one-period interest rate.  
The individual parameters of this base case are varied to see the effect  
on the absolute and relative performance of each policy. Along with  
expected profit, a *fill rate* is computed for each policy, defined as the  
expected number of customers who are awarded an item divided by the  
expected number who attempt to purchase \(those with valuations above  
the reserve price in the auction or those with valuations above the fixed  
price in the base-stock, list price case\).14 The fill rate gives a measure of  
14 Formally, if then the fill rate is the ratio denotes the number of customers with valuations greater than  
in the auction case and  
in the list price case, where is the optimal list price. *Auctions* 287  
the scarcity of inventory relative to demand and is a traditional service  
measure in inventory problems.  
The first experiment shows how the profit is affected by the number  
of customers in each period. The number of customers *N* is assumed  
constant, but *N* is varied from 1 to 1,000. All other parameters are the  
same as in the base case. The results are summarized in Table 6.3. As  
one would expect, the profits and inventory levels increase in both poli-  
cies as the number of customers increases. Also, as shown theoretically  
in Proposition 6.10, the base-stock, list-price mechanism is optimal in  
the limiting case of just one customer per period. In the other extreme,  
as *N* gets large, again the base-stock, list price profit approaches the  
optimal auction profit, as predicted by the asymptotic result of Propo-  
sition 6.10. The biggest benefit from the auction occurs at a moderate  
value of five customers per period, where it achieves a 3.2% increase in  
profits over list pricing.  
Note that the fill rate and inventory level are also higher in the base-  
stock, list price case. This suggests that the auction policy deliberately  
introduces some scarcity in the available goods to create more bidding  
competition among the customers.  
The next experiment shows the effect of varying the interest rate  
equivalently varying the holding cost rate since \(with  
in our case\). Typically, this interest rate represents a cost of capital plus  
a rate of depreciation in the product’s value over time. Table 6.4 shows  
the results. The small difference in the expected profits for the lowest  
interest rate confirms the result of Proposition 6.10—low holding cost  
leads to high inventory levels, which reduces the bidding competition and  
hence the benefit of the auction. As the interest rate rises, the auction  
performs relatively better, achieving a large 21.67% improvement over  
list pricing when the interest rate reaches 10%. This is simply the reverse  
effect\: a high holding cost means the firm is unwilling to stock much 288 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
inventory. Since the number of customers per period is unchanged, the  
number of customers per unit of inventory increases; more competition  
among customers is created and hence the auction mechanism performs  
relatively better.  
It is worth pointing out, however, that there are few practical situa-  
tions where interest rates of over 1% per period are observed, especially  
if one is considering auctions that are held relatively frequently \(such  
as weekly\). Rates this high are observed for products such as personal  
computers, which become obsolete quickly, but for most goods, weekly  
rates of less than 1% are the norm. This suggests that either the prod-  
uct has to suffer rapid depreciation or selling events have to be relatively  
infrequent \(such as monthly or semiannual periods, not weekly\) for the  
firm to realize a significant benefit from using auctions over list pricing.  
Finally, as in the finite-horizon problem without replenishment, nu-  
merical experiments show that variability in the valuations or vari-  
ability in the number of customers *N* increases the relative benefits of  
the auction policy.  
**6.5 Network Auctions**  
We next consider an auction mechanism for a network RM prob-  
lem of the type studied in Chapter 3, which is based on Cooper and  
Menich \[129\]. Customers in this case bid for products \(combinations of  
resources\), and the firm awards resources based on these product-level  
bids. Such auctions are also relevant to procurement settings, where  
customers bid for a mix of inputs required to produce a given product.  
Customers desire the entire *bill of materials* \(the complete set of re-  
sources\) and a firm, with stockpiles of the various resources, must solicit  
bids and award the resources given a collection of *package* bids.  
We next look at such an auction based on a network version of the  
Vickrey \(second-price, sealed-bid\) auction \(a so-called Vickrey-Clarke-  
Groves mechanism \[533, 120, 226\]\). We describe the basic mechanism  
and the resulting equilibrium bidding strategies and then explore the *Auctions* 289  
connections between this problem and traditional, network-capacity-  
control problems.  
**6.5.1 Problem Definition and Mechanism**  
The problem definition and notation are similar to those in Chapter 3,  
but are slightly modified to be consistent with the auction notation of  
this chapter. There are *N* customers, each with a private valuation  
for one unit of product which requires one or more of resources.  
We define if the product required by customer uses resource  
and otherwise. The incidence matrix is defined by  
The vector of current remaining capacities of the resources is  
Because the mechanism is based on a generalized Vickrey  
auction, minimal assumptions about customers and their valuations are  
needed, as we show below. In fact, we require only that customers are  
rational and that their valuations are finite.  
The mechanism is defined as follows. As in the classical auction set-  
ting, let denote the allocation vector,  
denote the payment vector, and vector of bidding strategies. Customers submit a sealed bid denote the  
for  
their desired product The firm collects all *N* bids  
and then solves the following integer program\:  
Let denote an optimal solution to this integer program. The set  
of winning customers is denoted  
It is important to note that the optimal value of this integer program  
is *not* the revenue earned by the firm; rather, it is solved simply as a  
means of determining winners and losers in the auction. The revenue  
to the firm will be determined by the vector of payments **p**\(**b**\) that are  
requested from the winning customers, which we look at next.  
Note that the surplus of customer is  
Let denote the unit vector and note that is the vector of  
bids with the component replaced by zero—that is, the vector of bids  
without the bid of customer Then the scheme calls for the winning  
customers to pay 290 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Note that the term is simply the network benefit  
of having customer bid. And also clearly  
since when adding customer bid of the optimal value of the problem  
\(6.26\) cannot increase by more than If it is  
because other winning bids were displaced to include the bid of customer  
in the optimal solution. Hence, represents  
the *displacement cost* produced by including customer in the winning  
set, and hence in this scheme a customer pays his displacement cost.  
As we show below, this displacement-cost interpretation of the payment  
has a close connection to the bid-price values from the network problems  
studied in Chapter 3.  
**6.5.2 Equilibrium Analysis**  
We next analyze the equilibrium produced by this mechanism. An  
important relation is obtained by rewriting \(6.28\) as  
This holds because  
which is trivially true when when then it is true  
because in this case  
Therefore, substituting \(6.29\) into \(6.27\), we find that the customer  
net utility can be written as  
This shows that customer payoff does not depend on his bid but  
only on whether his bid places him in the winning set  
Thus, as in a second-price auction, one can show that if a  
customer bids less than his valuation, it reduces his chances of winning  
only in cases where he would have a positive net surplus, and bidding  
more than his valuation increases his chance of winning only in cases  
where his net surplus is negative. Indeed, one can prove  
PROPOSITION 6.11 *Under a sealed-bid mechanism with allocations de-*  
*termined by an optimal solution to \(6.26\) and payments deter-*  
*mined by \(6.28\), then is a dominant strategy for all cus-*  
*tomers, and hence is a dominant-strategy equilibrium.* *Auctions* 291  
As a result of this fact, we can assume **b** = **v**, and the equilibrium  
revenue collected by the firm is therefore given by  
Note that this revenue is less than since and  
when So the revenue collected by the firm is less than the  
optimal solution to the integer program \(6.26\) as claimed.  
**6.5.3 Relationship to Traditional Auctions**  
We next show that this mechanism is indeed the network generaliza-  
tion of the second-price mechanism in a traditional *C*-unit auction. To  
see this, note we can formulate the *C*-unit auction as an instance of  
the network auction with and In this case, solving the  
integer program \(6.26\) is trivial. We simply award the *C* items to the  
*C* customers with the highest bids which is the same as the classical  
second-price allocation. Also, note that the optimal value is  
where pays  
denotes the highest bid. As a result, by \(6.28\) each winner  
which is just the usual second-price auction payment with no reserve  
price. Thus, the allocations and payments reduce to those of the classical  
*C*-unit second-price auction in the case.  
**6.5.4Relationship to Traditional Network RM**  
This network-auction mechanism also has an interesting connection  
to bid prices in traditional network RM. We proceed informally here to  
illustrate the ideas, but the connections can be made rigorous. 292 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Consider the linear programming relaxation of \(6.26\), which is  
Note that this is the exactly same form as the deterministic linear pro-  
gramming \(DLP\) model of Section 3.3.1, interpreting the demands for  
product to be one for all Let denote the optimal solution of  
\(6.30\). As in the DLP model, let denote a vector of  
optimal dual variables for the capacity constraints  
Note that if we remove customer from the problem, then the re-  
duction in revenue in this relaxed problem is zero if while if  
it is approximately given by15  
since removing customer eliminates his bid but frees up a unit of  
capacity on each resource used by product and gives the mar-  
ginal benefit of this freed-up capacity. So the right-hand side above is  
approximately the net benefit of having customer in the problem.  
As a result, the amount a winning customer pays from \(6.28\) is  
approximately  
Thus, roughly speaking, winning customers pay the bid prices of the set  
of resources required by the product they are bidding for.16 Of course,  
the actual bidding mechanism uses an integer program rather than a  
linear program, but the connection is still close.  
For example, if we allow continuous allocations in the auction \(cus-  
tomers can receive a fractional quantity of the product they bid on and  
are willing to accept any quantity between 0 and 1\), the two problems  
l5Here, we are ignoring the possibility that the dual is degenerate, and we are assuming the  
allowable decrease in the right-hand side of the constraints is at least one, so that  
measures the change in the optimal objective function when the capacity is reduced by  
the vector  
16Despite the close connection between bid prices and the price paid by customers in this  
network Vickrey auction, the use of the term bid price is purely a coincidence; the two  
problems were not connected in the literature or in practice until quite recently. *Auctions* 293  
coincide exactly. In this case, by linear programming duality, one can  
say that a customer gets a positive allocation only if his bid is at  
least as large as the sum of the bid prices, The payment of  
these customers with positive allocations is also given by the sum of the  
bid prices.  
**6.5.5 Revenue Maximization and Reserve Prices**  
While the network mechanism outlined above has a well-defined,  
dominant-strategy equilibrium, it is not revenue maximizing for the firm.  
To see this, suppose that for any customer  
This would occur, for example, if the resources required by the product  
requested by customer are not capacity constrained, so that includ-  
ing as one of the winners would not displace any other winners. In  
this case, the payment according to \(6.28\) is simply There-  
fore, any customers requesting unconstrained resources would win and  
pay nothing. However, clearly, the firm would increase its revenue by  
charging these customers something positive.  
Just as in the classical auction, reserve prices can be used to increase  
the revenue in the network case. However, there is no theory showing  
how to construct optimal reserve prices in this case. Still, one can heuris-  
tically consider a scheme whereby the firm imposes reserve prices, de-  
noted on each resource and requires each customer to submit bids  
that exceed the sum of the reserve prices of the resources requested—  
that is, It is still a dominant strategy for customer to bid  
his valuation provided it exceed otherwise, his dominant  
strategy is not to bid at all.  
Numerical results show that one can increase revenue significantly by  
using such reserve prices. For example, Table 6.5 shows the simulated  
revenues for an example with two resources and three customer types.  
Type 1 customers require only resource 1, type 2 customers require only  
resource 2, and type 3 customers require both resources 1 and 2. The  
number of customers of each type is an independent Poisson random  
variable. Customers of types 1 and 2 have valuations with a mean of  
100 and variance of 10; customers of type 3 have a valuation with mean  
200 and variance of 20. There are 20 units of capacity for each of the two  
resources. Two demand scenarios are tested—a high-demand scenario  
in which the mean number of customers of each type is 15 and a low-  
demand scenario in which the mean number of customers of each type is  
5\. Symmetric reserve prices are used for each of the two resources, but  
they are varied.  
Table 6.5 shows the effect of the reserve prices on the average revenues  
in the two scenarios. Note that in the high-demand scenario \(Poisson- 294 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
15\), the reserve price has a minimal effect on the average revenue for low  
reserve prices, with a maximum occurring at \$70. However, revenues  
decrease significantly once the reserve price approaches \$100, the mean  
valuation that customers have for each resource. In contrast, in the low-  
demand scenario \(Poisson-5\), the reserve price significantly increases  
revenues, achieving a maximum with a reserve price of \$80. Again,  
revenues fall when we increase the reserve price beyond this point. This  
behavior is consistent with a traditional *C*-unit auction, where reserve  
prices affect only the revenue when there are fewer than *C* customers  
willing to bid above the reserve price.

The formal study of auctions stems from the seminal work of Vick-

alence of standard first and second-price auctions. The extensive two-  
volume collection edited by Klemperer \[306\] provides an excellent source

# CUSTOMER-BEHAVIOR AND  
# MARKET-RESPONSE MODELS  
This chapter reviews the basic theory of consumer choice, aggregate  
demand, and the operational, market-response models that are used in  
both quantity- and price-based revenue management. Because demand  
results from many individuals making choice decisions—choices to buy  
one firm’s products over another, to wait or not to buy at all, to buy  
more or fewer units—we begin by looking at models of individual-choice  
behavior. When added up, these individual purchase decisions deter-  
mine aggregate demand, so we next discuss aggregate-demand functions  
and their properties. Our treatment of the theory is somewhat abbrevi-  
ated, aimed more at developing an intuitive and practical understanding  
of the concepts. The Notes and Sources section at the end of the chap-  
ter provides references that offer more extensive treatment of consumer  
behavior theory. Appendix E at the end of the book provides a basic ref-  
erence on consumer theory, including utility theory, reservation prices,  
and risk preferences.  
**7.1 The Independent-Demand Model**  
Before delving into more complex models of demand, we first briefly  
review the *independent-demand model,* which is the basis of much of  
the material in Chapters 2 and 3 on quantity-based RM. This model is  
rather simple\: it assumes that demand for each product is an indepen-  
dent stochastic process, not influenced by the firm’s availability controls.  
Further, as we have seen in Section 2.2, static models of quantity-based  
RM also assume that the demand for products arrives in a specified or-  
der over the booking period, with demand for the lower-priced products  
appearing first. Thus, the independent model does not endogenize cus-  
tomer behavior, neither choice behavior nor purchase-timing behavior. 302 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
While it is easy to criticize the simplistic nature of this model, one  
can make a few theoretical and practical arguments in support of it.  
As discussed in Chapter 2, in standard quantity-based RM practice the  
customer is faced with a menu of possible products differentiated by  
prices and restrictions. As a result, if the firm offers products, cus-  
tomers are approximately segmented into separated populations \(one  
for each product\) according to their preference for the different product  
restrictions and prices. If customers are sufficiently well segmented by  
the restrictions \(in the sense that most of the customers who are eligi-  
ble to purchase one product are not eligible to buy another\), then the  
independent-demand assumption is not unreasonable. However, this ar-  
gument is admittedly weakened by the fact that \(at least in the airline  
case\) most restrictions are progressively relaxed as the fares get higher.  
So a customer who is eligible for one fare class is normally eligible for  
all classes with higher fares. We must then assume that customers are  
unwilling to purchase these higher fares.  
Second, the independent-demand model is reasonable if the market  
is competitive and products are commodities—defined as products in  
which the identity of the supplier is of little importance to customers. In  
such cases, firms are price takers and can control only the quantity they  
sell; customers, in turn, base their choices only on price and are willing  
to buy from any firm offering the market price. \(See Section 8.2.\) Hence,  
if a given commodity product is not available at one firm—in particular,  
if its availability is closed by RM system controls—then demand for  
that product effectively disappears because customers will purchase the  
product from a competitor rather than switching to alternative products.  
Third, the model reflects the current airline and hotel industry prac-  
tice of separating pricing and capacity-control decisions, reflecting the  
different scope of the two in these industries—pricing decisions are made  
infrequently, while capacity-control is done in real-time; prices are set  
at a market level that includes a large number of flight departures \(for  
airlines\) and for an entire season \(for a hotel\) while capacity control is  
exerted on individual flights and dates. The implicit assumption in tra-  
ditional quantity-based RM is that when prices for the products change,  
the change in the demand being observed will influence the forecasts  
and this changed forecasts, together with the new price of each product,  
will lead to changes in the capacity controls on each flight. This sort  
of quasi-static view of the price-demand relationship lies at the heart of  
current RM practice, and indeed the success of traditional RM method-  
ology points to the practical utility of the overall approach.  
Finally, the independent-demand model considerably simplifies the  
RM forecasting and optimization tasks. Forecasting can use historical *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 303  
demand data in standard time series forecasting methods, and we can  
solve stochastic optimization models based on the independent-demand  
model \(at least approximately\) relatively efficiently.  
Yet despite these arguments in support of the independent-demand  
model, the fact that it ignores consumer behavior is conceptually unsat-  
isfying and, more important, limits the full potential of RM methods.  
To counter its simplifications, a number of ad-hoc methods, such as the  
sell-up model discussed in Section 2.6, have been proposed. The discrete-  
choice model of Section 2.6 is a more recent alternative that overcomes  
the limitations of the independent-demand model. This latter model  
has more in common with the customer-choice-behavior view of demand  
that is the focus of this chapter.  
**7.2 Models of Individual Customer Choice**  
We next look at the basic approaches for modeling individual customer  
purchase decisions. In Chapter 9, we discuss methods for estimating the  
parameters of these models.  
**7.2.1 Reservation-Price Models**  
The simplest practical models of customer choice directly model cus-  
tomers’ reservation prices for particular items. Each customer is as-  
sumed to follow a simple decision rule\: if his reservation price \(or val-  
uation\) equals or exceeds the offered price the customer purchases  
the product; otherwise, he will not purchase the product. Moreover, he  
buys at most one unit of the product.  
A customer’s reservation price is specific to each individual and typ-  
ically is private information unknown to the firm. However, based on  
management judgment, historical observed purchase behavior or other  
observable characteristics of the individual \(such as place, time, and  
channel of purchase\), the seller can attempt to model the distribution  
of the reservation prices across a population of customers and estimate  
at least the parameters of the distribution. This leads to a problem of  
finding a distribution *F*\(·\) such that the probability that a customer’s  
reservation price is below is given by  
Often, however, the distribution of reservation prices is modeled in-  
directly by assuming an aggregate-demand function, as we discuss in  
Section 7.3 below. Hence, we postpone further discussion of reservation-  
price modeling until that point. 304 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**7.2.2 Random-Utility Models**  
Random-utility models are based on a probabilistic model of indi-  
vidual customer utility. \(See Appendix E for a formal discussion of  
utility theory.\) They are useful for several reasons. First, probabilistic  
models can be used to represent heterogeneity of preference among a  
population of customers. Second, they can model uncertainty in choice  
outcomes due to the inability of the firm to observe all the relevant  
variables affecting a given customer’s choice \(other alternatives, their  
prices, the customer’s wealth, and so on\). Third, they can model sit-  
uations where customers exhibit *variety-seeking behavior* and deliber-  
ately alter their choices over time \(movie or meal choice, for example\).  
Finally, probabilistic choice can model customers whose behavior is in-  
herently unpredictable—that is, customers who behave in a way that is  
inconsistent with well-defined preferences and at best, exhibit only some  
probabilistic tendency to prefer one alternative to another. Luce \[349\]  
developed a model of this type of random-choice behavior based purely  
on a set of axioms on choice probabilities, analogous to the axioms used  
to define classical deterministic utility functions. \(See Appendix E.\)1  
For all these reasons, it is often reasonable to assume that a firm has  
only probabilistic information on the utility function of any given cus-  
tomer, and this can be modeled by assuming that customers’ utilities  
for alternatives are themselves random variables. Specifically, let the  
alternatives be denoted A customer has a utility for  
alternative denoted Without loss of generality we can decom-  
pose this utility into two parts, a *representative* component that is  
deterministic and a mean-zero *random* component, Therefore,  
and the probability that an individual selects alternative *S* of alternatives is given by2  
from a subset  
In other words, the probability that the alternatives in the set *S.*  
The representative component various observable attributes of alternative has the highest utility among all  
is often modeled as a function of  
A common assumption is  
1The distinction between models based on randomized preferences and those based on  
random-choice behavior is important primarily to behavioral theorists. A seminal work in  
this area is Block and Marschak \[79\]. However, for most RM problems what matters most is  
the demand process produced by a given model.  
2That customers choose based on maximizing utility is itself an assumption. See Appendix E  
for a discussion of utility maximization as a model of customer choice. *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 305  
the *linear-in-attributes* model  
where is a vector of parameters and is a vector of attribute values  
for alternative which could include factors such as price, measures of  
quality and indicator variables for product features. Variables describing  
characteristics of the customer \(segment variables\) can also be included  
in 3  
This formulation defines a general class of random-utility models,  
which vary according to the assumptions on the joint distribution of the  
utilities Random-utility models are no more restrictive in  
terms of modeling behavior than are classical utility models; essentially,  
all we need assume is that customers have well-defined preferences so  
that utility maximization is an accurate model of their choice behavior.  
\(Theorem E.3 in Appendix E.\) However, as a practical matter, certain  
assumptions on the random utilities lead to much simpler models than  
others. We look at a few of these special cases next.  
**7.2.2.1 Binary Probit**  
If there are only two alternatives to choose from \(such as buying or  
not buying a product\) and the error terms are independent,  
normally distributed random variables with mean zero and identical vari-  
ances then the probability that alternative 1 is chosen is given by  
where denotes the standard normal distribution. This model is  
known as the *binary-probit* model. While the normal distribution is an  
appealing model of disturbances in utility \(it can be viewed as the sum  
of a large number of random disturbances\), the resulting probabilities do  
not have a closed-form solution. This has led researchers to seek other,  
more analytically tractable, models.  
**7.2.2.2 Binary Logit**  
The binary-logit model applies also to a situation with exactly two  
choices, similar to the binary-probit case, but is simpler to analyze. The  
assumption made here is that the error term has a *logistic*  
3Specifically, the utility can also depend on observable customer characteristics, so for cus-  
tomer the utility of alternative is For simplicity, we ignore customer-specific charac-  
teristics here, but they can be incorporated into all the models that follow. 306 distribution—that is,  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where *µ* \> 0 is a scale parameter and Here has a  
mean zero and variance The logistic distribution provides a good  
approximation to the normal distribution, though it has “fatter tails.”  
The probability that alternative 1 is chosen is given by  
**7.2.2.3 Multinomial Logit**  
The multinomial-logit model \(MNL\) is a generalization of the binary-  
logit model to alternatives. It is derived by assuming that the are  
i.i.d. random variables with a Gumbel \(or double-exponential\) distribu-  
tion with cumulative density function  
where The mean and variance of is Euler’s constant \(= 0.5772...\) and *µ* is a scale parameter.  
are  
The Gumbel distribution has some useful analytical properties, the  
most important of which is that the distribution of the maximum of  
independent Gumbel random variables with the same scale parameter *µ*  
is also a Gumbel random variable. If two random variables and are  
Gumbel distributed with mean 0 and scale parameter *µ*, then  
has a logistic distribution with mean 0 and variance, leading to the  
binary-logit model.  
For the MNL model, the probability that an alternative is chosen  
from a set that contains is given by  
If the model—namely  
has a unique maximum and then the variance of  
tends to zero and the MNL reduces to a deterministic *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 307  
Conversely, if then the variance of the tends to  
infinity and the systematic component of utility becomes negligible.  
In this case,  
which corresponds to a uniform random choice of the alternatives in *S.*  
Hence, the MNL can model behavior ranging from deterministic utility  
maximization to purely random choice.  
The MNL has been widely used as a model of customer choice. How-  
ever, it possesses a somewhat restrictive property known as the *indepen-*  
*dence from irrelevant alternatives* \(IIA\) property—namely, for any two  
sets and any two alternatives the choice  
probabilities satisfy  
Equation \(7.7\) says that the relative likelihood of choosing and is  
independent of the choice set containing these alternatives. This prop-  
erty is not realistic, however, if the choice set contains alternatives that  
can be grouped such that alternatives within a group are more similar  
than alternatives outside the group because adding a new alternative  
reduces the probability of choosing similar alternatives more than dis-  
similar alternatives. A famous example illustrating this point is the  
“blue-bus/red-bus paradox,” \(Debreu \[150\]\)\:  
**Example 7.1** An individual has to travel and can use one of two modes of trans-  
portation\: a car or a bus. Suppose the individual selects them with equal probability.  
Let the set *S =* \{car, bus\}. Then  
Suppose now that another bus is introduced that is identical to the current bus  
in all respects except color\: one is blue and one is red. Let the set *T* denote  
\{car, blue bus, red bus\}. Then the MNL predicts  
However, as bus color is likely an irrelevant characteristic in this choice situation, it  
is more realistic to assume that the choice of bus or car is still equally likely, in which  
case we should have 308 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
As a result of IIA, the MNL model must be used with caution. It  
should be restricted to choice sets that contain alternatives that are, in  
some sense, “equally dissimilar.” Example 9.18 provides one empirical  
test for the IIA property.  
Despite this deficiency, the MNL model is widely used in marketing.  
\(See Guadagni and Little’s \[227\] work on determining brand share in  
the presence of marketing variables such as advertising and promotion.\)  
It has also seen considerable application in estimating travel demand.  
\(See Ben-Akiva and Lerman \[48\].\) The popularity of MNL stems from  
the fact that it is analytically tractable, relatively accurate \(if applied  
correctly\), and can be estimated easily using standard statistical tech-  
niques. \(See Example 9.6.\)  
Variations of the MNL have been introduced to avoid the IIA problem,  
the most prevalent of which is the nested MNL \[49\]. Our next section  
looks at some generalizations of the MNL that avoid the IIA property.  
**7.2.3 Customer Heterogeneity and Segmentation**  
RM often relies on the premise that different customers are willing  
to pay different amounts for a product. For example, demand functions  
arise from heterogeneity in the reservation prices of customers. In many  
situations, this level of modeling of heterogeneity is sufficient or is the  
only practical approach.  
Yet a more accurate representation of demand is achievable if cus-  
tomers can be segmented into groups with similar preferences and price  
responses. This entails classifying customers into *K* segments, where  
each segment has its own choice model. If done properly, each of these  
segment-level models predicts the behavior of the segment better than a  
common choice model. In the extreme case, one could potentially define  
a different segment for each customer. However, a model of heterogene-  
ity has to find the right balance between estimability and accuracy; each  
segment should not be so narrowly defined or so small as to make estima-  
tion impossible, yet it should be sufficiently small that customers within  
a segment have relatively homogeneous price and marketing variable re-  
sponses. The aim is to maximize between-group variation but minimize  
within-group variation with respect to market responses. \(Many of the  
techniques used to identify and segment customers are based on cluster  
analysis.\) We next look at a few common approaches along these lines.  
**7.2.3.1 Finite-Mixture Logit Models**  
In the basic MNL model with linear-in-attribute utilities, the coeffi-  
cients in \(7.3\) are assumed to be the same for all customers. This may  
not be an appropriate assumption if there are different segments with *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 309  
different preferences. Moreover, as we’ve seen, the assumption leads to  
the IIA property, which may not be reasonable in certain contexts. If  
we can identify each customer as belonging to a segment, then it is an  
easy matter to simply fit a separate MNL model to the data from each  
segment. However, a more sophisticated modeling approach is needed if  
segment membership is not observable.  
Assume that customers within each segment follow a MNL model  
with identical parameters and that customers have a certain probability  
of belonging to a segment \(called a *latent segment\),* which has to be  
estimated along with the MNL parameters for each segment. This results  
in the so-called *finite-mixture logit models.*  
Assume that there are *L* latent segments and that the probability that  
a customer belongs to segment is given by  
All customers in segment are assumed to have utilities determined by  
an identical vector of coefficients Then the probability of choosing  
alternative in this finite-mixture logit model is given by  
One then tries to estimate the coefficients of the model and  
using, for example, maximum-likelihood methods. This model  
often provides better estimates of choice behavior than the standard  
MNL model, at the expense of a more complicated estimation procedure.  
**7.2.3.2 Random-Coefficients Logit Models**  
Another approach to modeling heterogeneity is to assume that each  
customer has a distinct set of coefficients that are drawn from a  
distribution—usually assumed normal for analytical convenience—over  
the population of potential customers. This leads to what is called the  
*random-coefficients logit model.* The coefficients may also be correlated,  
both within themselves as well as with the error term, though we focus  
here on the simpler case where the coefficients are mutually independent.  
Here again the utility of alternative is given, similar to the MNL  
model, as  
However, cients in is now considered a vector of random coefficients, each el-  
ement of which is assumed to be independent of both the other coeffi-  
and the error term Furthermore, the components of 310 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
are assumed to be normally distributed with a vector of means **b** and a  
vector of standard deviations The components of the random vector  
corresponding to characteristic denoted can be decomposed  
into  
where variables.  
term  
is a collection of i.i.d. standard normal random  
It is convenient to express the utility as a systematic part and a mean-  
zero error term as before\: To this end, define the composite random-error  
Then a customer’s random utility is given by  
where is given by \(7.8\). Hence, the key difference between the stan-  
dard MNL and the random-coefficient logit is that the error terms  
are no longer independent across the alternatives \(and somewhat less  
important, they are no longer Gumbel distributed\). The following ex-  
ample illustrates the idea\:  
**Example 7.2** Suppose that there are three alternatives with two char-  
acteristics each and that the values of the characteristics are given as in  
Table 7.1.  
If the parameter means are estimated as then the logit model  
would have a customer choosing one of the three products with an equal probability.  
In contrast, the random-coefficients logit model would have customers with a high  
preference for characteristic1 high\) consider alternatives 1 and 2 as closer substi-  
tutes than alternative 3. Customer preferences and product characteristics interact  
via \(7.8\).  
Note also that the IIA property of standard logit is partially mitigated in this  
model. A customer with a high preference for characteristic will choose  
alternative 2 with high probability if the choice set \{2,3\} is offered and will choose 1  
or 2 with equal probability if the choice set \{1,2, 3\} is offered.  
**7.3 Models of Aggregate Demand**  
Even with transaction-level data, it is often easier to model and es-  
timate aggregate demand rather than individual customer-choice deci-  
sions. Figure 7.1 illustrates how the heterogenous reservation prices of  
individual demand translate into a price versus quantity relationship for  
aggregate demand. Depending on the model, this aggregate demand *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 311  
could be defined at the product, firm, or market level. If defined at  
the product or firm level, interactions with demand for other products  
\(cross-elasticities\) and dependence on historical demand or product at-  
tributes may have to be incorporated in its specification. In this section,  
we look at some commonly used aggregate-demand models.  
**7.3.1 Demand Functions and Their Properties**  
For the case of a single product, let and denote, respectively,  
the \(scalar\) price and the corresponding demand at that price. Also  
let denote the set of feasible prices \(the domain\) of the demand  
function. For most demand functions of interest, but some  
functions \(such as the linear-demand function\) are not well defined for  
all nonnegative prices. 312 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**7.3.1.1 Regularity**  
It is often convenient to make the following regularity assumptions  
about the demand function\:  
ASSUMPTION 7.1 \(REGULARITY\: SCALAR CASE\)  
*\(i\) The demand function is continuously differentiate on*  
*\(ii\) The demand function is strictly decreasing, \(iii\) The demand function is bounded above and below\:*  
*on*  
*\(iv\) The demand tends to zero for sufficiently high prices*—*namely,*  
*\(v\) The revenue function is finite for all maximizer that is interior to the set*  
*and has a finite*  
These are not restrictive assumptions in most cases and simply help  
avoid some technical complications in both analysis and numerical op-  
timization. For example, consider a linear demand model \(defined for-  
mally in Section 7.3.3.1\)  
This is trivially differentiable on is strictly decreasing if nonnegative and bounded for all tends to zero for the revenue and has a finite maximizer  
is  
and  
**7.3.1.2 Market-Share and Reservation-Price Distribution**  
It is sometimes convenient to express the demand function in the form  
where is a cumulative distribution function and *N* is interpreted as  
the *market size.* is then interpreted as the fraction of the market  
that is willing to buy at price equivalently, is the distribution of  
reservation prices in the customer population. The derivative of  
is denoted  
For example, consider again the linear-demand function \(7.10\). This  
can be written in the form \(7.11\) if we define and  
Since *F*\(.\) is the probability distribution of a customer’s reservation price  
reservation prices are uniformly distributed in the linear-demand-  
function case. *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 313  
**7.3.1.3 Elasticity of Demand**  
The *price elasticity* of demand is the relative change in demand pro-  
duced by a relative change in price. It is defined by  
Note that elasticity is defined at a particular price  
To illustrate, for the linear-demand function \(7.10\), elasticity is  
so the  
Products can be categorized based on the magnitude of their elasticities.  
A product with is said to be *elastic,* while one with a elasticity  
value is said to be *inelastic.* If demand for the  
product is said to be *perfectly elastic,* while if demand is  
said to be *perfectly inelastic.* Table 7.2 shows a sample of estimated  
elasticities for common consumer products. While many factors affect  
elasticity, these estimates give some sense of the relative magnitudes of  
elasticities.  
**7.3.1.4 Inverse Demand**  
The *inverse-demand function,* denoted which generates a demand equal to —that is,  
is the largest value of  
Given an inverse-demand function, one can view demand rather than  
price as the decision variable, since every choice of a demand implies  
a unique choice of price This is useful, as it is often easier ana-  
lytically and computationally to work with demand rather than price as  
the decision variables in optimization problems.  
The inverse may not be well-defined, however—for example, for values  
of corresponding to points at which the demand function has a  
jump discontinuity. Also, there may be not be a price that produces  
any given value of demand \(for example, if demand remains bounded  
as tends to zero yet is large\). Since not all values of may be  
obtainable, we let denote the set of achievable demand values. This  
set plays a role analogous to for the demand function.  
Under the regularity Assumption 7.1, the demand function is strictly  
decreasing and continuously differentiable on so the inverse-demand  
function is always well defined and continuously differentiable on the  
set Indeed, under Assumption 7.1, the 314 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
demand function is continuous, decreasing, and bounded and tends to  
zero for sufficiently high prices. One can also verify that the domain of  
the inverse-demand function is always an interval of the form  
for some upper bound  
Equation \(7.11\) expressed in terms of the reservation-price distribu-  
tion, the inverse-demand function is defined by *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 315  
where is the inverse of *F*\(.\)*.*  
To illustrate, the inverse of the linear-demand function \(7.10\) is  
and the set of feasible demand rates is  
**7.3.1.5 Revenue Function**  
The *revenue function,* denoted is defined by  
This is the revenue generated when using the price and is of fun-  
damental importance in dynamic-pricing problems. For example, the  
linear-demand function \(7.10\) has a revenue function  
For most dynamic-pricing problems, we require that this revenue func-  
tion be concave, as in the linear example above. This condition leads to  
well-behaved optimization problems.  
**7.3.1.6 Marginal Revenue**  
Another important quantity in pricing analysis is the rate of change  
of revenue with quantity—the *marginal revenue*—which is denoted  
It is defined by  
It is frequently useful to express this marginal revenue as a function of  
price rather than quantity. At the slight risk of confusion over notation,  
we replace by above and define the marginal revenue as a function  
of price by4  
4By the inverse-function theorem, 316 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Note that above is still the marginal revenue with respect to  
quantity— —but expressed as function of price rather than quan-  
tity; in particular, it is not the marginal revenue with respect to price.5  
Expressing marginal revenue in terms of the reservation-price distri-  
bution we have that  
where is the *hazard rate* of the distribution  
6 The marginal revenue function plays an important role in pricing  
problems. It is also central to the design of revenue-maximizing auctions,  
where it is referred to as the *virtual utility,* for reasons that are discussed  
in Chapter 6.  
To illustrate, consider the marginal revenue of the linear-demand func-  
tion of \(7.10\) as a function of  
Substituting as a function of price  
for above we obtain the marginal revenue  
It is frequently useful to make the following assumption about the  
marginal revenue\:  
ASSUMPTION 7.2 \(MONOTONE MARGINAL REVENUE\) *The marginal*  
*revenue defined by \(7.11\) is strictly decreasing in the demand*  
*Equivalently, the marginal revenue defined by \(7.13\) is strictly*  
*increasing in the price*  
5The relationship between the marginal revenue with respect to price and quantity is as  
follows\: since then and Therefore,  
\(This also follows from the chain rule.\)  
6To see this, note that so  
where the first equality follows from \(7.13\) and the next two from \(7.11\). *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 317  
Note that this condition guarantees that the revenue function is  
a concave function of the demand which again is a useful property in  
optimization models because it guarantees that first-order conditions are  
sufficient for determining an optimal price. This property is satisfied,  
for example, by the linear-demand function.  
Slightly weaker conditions than those of Assumption 7.2 will also en-  
sure that pricing-optimization problems are well behaved. In particular,  
if the revenue function is strictly unimodal,7 this is often sufficient to  
ensure that there is a unique optimal price. \(This is true for simple un-  
constrained pricing problems, for example.\) Recall that denotes the  
reservation-price density \(derivative of and  
denotes the hazard rate. Then the following sufficient conditions on the  
reservation-price distribution ensure strict unimodality of the revenue  
function \(see Ziya et al. \[591\]\)\:  
PROPOSITION 7.1 *Suppose that the reservation-price distribution*  
*is twice differentiable and strictly increasing on its domain*  
*and Suppose further that F*\(·\) *satisfies any one*  
*of the following conditions\:*  
*\(i\) for all*  
*\(ii\) for all*  
*\(iii\) for all*  
*Then the revenue functions is strictly*  
*unimodal on \(equivalently, the revenue function is*  
*strictly unimodal on*  
Ziya et al. \[591\] show there are demand functions that satisfy one  
condition but not the others, so the three conditions are distinct.  
Another desirable property of the marginal revenue function is that it  
spans the range as ranges over \(equivalently, ranges over  
\). This is because in optimization problems, the first-order conditions  
typically involve equating marginal revenue to a nonnegative value \(such  
as a cost or a Lagrange multiplier\). If the marginal revenue spans the  
range then the solutions of the first-order conditions are always  
in \(or \), and therefore, the explicit price \(or demand\) constraints  
can be safely ignored. We formalize this property in the following as-  
sumption\:  
7 A function defined on the domain is said to be a *unimodal function* if there exists  
an such that is strictly increasing on and is strictly decreasing on 318 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
ASSUMPTION 7.3 *The range of the marginal revenue defined by \(7.11\)*  
*and \(7.13\) spans That is, for every such*  
*that equivalently, such that*  
Note that the linear-demand function does not satisfy this condition  
because the marginal revenue is and so  
the marginal revenue ranges over Other common demand  
functions, however, do satisfy this assumption, as described below.  
**7.3.1.7 Revenue-Maximizing Price**  
Under Assumption 7.2, the revenue is maximized at the point where  
the marginal revenue becomes zero. Assumption 7.1, part \(v\), requires  
that the maximizer is an interior point of the domain in which case  
the *revenue-maximizing price* is determined by the first-order condi-  
tion  
Similarly, the revenue-maximizing demand, denoted is defined by  
They are related by  
For example, for the linear-demand function we have  
so an interior point of the set The revenue-  
maximizing demand is  
Note from \(7.13\) that since \(from Assump-  
tion 7.1, part \(ii\)\), and is the price elasticity, we have  
Thus, marginal revenue is increasing if demand is elastic at \(that is,  
if \), and marginal revenue is decreasing if demand is inelastic  
at \(that is, if \). At the critical value marginal  
revenue is zero and revenues are maximized.  
If is not monotone but one of the conditions of Proposition 7.1  
is satisfied, then is a price such that is increasing for and  
is decreasing for moreover,  
Figure 7.2 illustrates the idea. Here, the revenue function for  
the linear-demand function is plotted above, while the marginal-revenue  
function is plotted below. Moving to the right corresponds to in-  
creasing the demand and decreasing the price The inelastic-demand  
region is to the right of and the elastic region is to the left of *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 319  
Starting at the far right with a price of zero, the demand is very  
inelastic; large relative changes in price \(for example, doubling the price  
from to \) result in small relative changes in demand. As a result,  
raising the price increases revenues. To the left, at very high price levels,  
relatively small decreases in price result in large increases in demand.  
Consequently, decreasing price improves revenues. The optimal price  
is the boundary of these two regions.  
If there is a cost for providing the product—either a direct cost or  
opportunity cost—it is always optimal to price in the elastic region. To  
see this, let denote the cost, so that is the firm’s profit.  
Then the optimal price will occur at a point where  
Assuming cost is strictly increasing in quantity, the optimal 320 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
price will be at a point where marginal revenue is positive—in the elastic  
region. Thus, it is almost never optimal to price in the inelastic region.8  
**7.3.2 Multiproduct-Demand Functions**  
In the case where there are products, let denote the price  
of product and denote the vector of all prices. The  
demand for product as a function of **p** is denoted and  
denotes the vector of demands for all products.  
Again, will denote the domain of the demand function. We also use  
the notation to denote all prices other  
than  
Paralleling the single-product case, the following regularity assump-  
tions for the multiproduct-demand function help ensure the resulting  
optimization models are well behaved\:  
ASSUMPTION 7.4 \(REGULARITY\: CASE\) *For*  
*\(i\) demand is strictly decreasing in for all*  
*\(ii\) The demand function is continuously differentiable on*  
*\(iii\)The demand function is bounded above and below\:*  
*\(iv\) The demand function tends to zero in its own price for sufficiently*  
*high prices—that is, for all*  
*\(v\) The revenue function is bounded for all and has a*  
*finite maximizer that is interior to*  
As in the scalar case, we let **p**\(**d**\) denote the inverse-demand distrib-  
ution; it gives the vector of prices that induces the vector of demands **d**.  
In the multiproduct case, this inverse is more difficult to define generally,  
and in most cases we simply assume it exists. \(For the common demand  
functions of Section 7.3.3, the inverse can be defined either explicitly or  
implicitly.\) Likewise, we denote by the domain of the inverse-demand  
function, the set of achievable demand vectors **d**.  
The revenue function is defined by  
which again represents the total revenue generated from using the vector  
of demands **d**—or equivalently, the vector of prices **p**\(**d**\). Paralleling  
8The only exception is if the firm *benefits* from disposing of products—that is, if it has a  
negative cost. For example, this could occur if there is a holding cost incurred for keeping  
units rather than selling them. In such cases, it may be optimal to price in the inelastic  
region. *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 321  
Assumptions 7.2 and 7.3, in the multiproduct case it is often convenient  
to make the following assumption\:  
ASSUMPTION 7.5 *The multiproduct revenue function satisfies*  
*\(i\) is jointly concave on*  
*\(ii\) For every there exists a such that*  
Again, these assumptions help simplify the resulting pricing optimiza-  
tion problems and, and though more difficult to check than in the single-  
product case, are satisfied by several common demand functions.  
The *cross-price elasticity* of demand is the relative change in demand  
for product produced by a relative change in the price of product It  
is defined by  
If the sign of the elasticity is positive, then products and are said  
to be *substitutes*; if the sign is negative, the products are said to be  
*complements.* Intuitively, substitutes are products that represent dis-  
tinct alternatives filling the same basic need \(such as Coke and Pepsi\),  
whereas complements are products that are consumed in combination  
to meet the same basic need \(such as hamburgers and buns\).  
**7.3.3 Common Demand Functions**  
The demand function of a product can depend on variables other  
than its price \(such as product attributes or, marketing variables such  
as advertising, brand name, competitor’s prices and past market share\),  
and modeling demand as a function of all relevant variables makes a  
model more realistic and accurate. The variables can either be current  
or lagged, when past-period variables affect demand. Here we focus  
on demand functions that depend only on current prices. A few other  
market-response functions that include nonprice variables are discussed  
in Section 9.6.4.  
Table 7.3 summarizes the most common demand functions and their  
properties, and Figure 7.3 shows graphs of a few of these. All these  
functions satisfy the regularity conditions in Assumptions 7.1 and 7.4,  
the exception being the constant-elasticity-demand function, which does  
not satisfy part \(v\) of either assumption as explained below. 322 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT* *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 323  
# 7.3.3.1 Linear Demand  
We have already seen the case of a linear-demand function in the  
scalar case. To summarize, it is  
where and are scalar parameters. The inverse-demand  
function is  
The linear model is popular because of its simple functional form.  
It is also easy to estimate from data using linear-regression techniques.  
However, it produces negative demand values when which can  
cause numerical difficulties when solving optimization problems. More-  
over, as mentioned, it does not satisfy Assumption 7.3. Hence, one must  
typically retain the price constraint set when using the  
linear model in optimization problems.  
In the multiproduct case, the linear model is  
where is vector of coefficients and is a matrix  
of price sensitivity coefficients with for all and the sign of  
depending on whether the products are complements  
or substitutes If **B** is nonsingular, then the inverse-demand  
function exists and is given by 324 One sufficient condition for satisfy9  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
to exist is that the *row* coefficients  
Roughly, this says that demand for each product is more sensitive to a  
change in its own price than it is to a simultaneous change in the prices  
of all other products. An alternative sufficient condition for to exist  
is that the *column* coefficients satisfy  
Equation \(7.17\) says that changes in the price of product impacts  
the demand for product more than it does the total demand for all  
other products combined. In the case of substitutes  
this is equivalent to saying there is an aggregate market expansion or  
contraction effect when prices change \(for example, the total market  
demand strictly decreases when the price of product increases, and  
demand for product is not simply reallocated one for one to substitute  
products\).  
**7.3.3.2 Log-Linear \(Exponential\) Demand**  
The log-linear—or exponential—demand function in the scalar case  
is defined by  
where and all nonnegative prices, so is  
are scalar parameters. This function is defined for  
The inverse-demand function  
The log-linear-demand function is popular in econometric studies and  
has several desirable theoretical and practical properties. First, unlike  
the linear model, demand is always nonnegative so one can treat price  
\(or quantity\) as unconstrained in optimization problems. Second, by  
taking the log of demand, we recover a linear form, so it is also well  
suited to estimation using linear regression. However, demand values  
of zero are not defined when taking logarithms, which is problematic in  
settings where sales are infrequent.  
The multidimensional log-linear form is  
9 As noted by Maglaras and Meissner \[354\] from conditions in Horn and Johnson \[258\]. *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 325  
where is a scalar coefficient and is a vector of  
price-sensitivity coefficients. Letting and as  
in the linear model, and taking the logarithm, we have  
so again the log-linear model can be estimated easily from data using  
linear regression provided the data is not too sparse.  
The inverse-demand function can be obtained as in the linear case if  
**B** is nonsingular, in which case  
and one can again use the sufficient conditions \(7.16\) or \(7.17\) to check  
that exists.  
**7.3.3.3 Constant-Elasticity Demand**  
The constant-elasticity-demand function in the single-product case is  
of the form  
where and are constants. The function is defined for  
all nonnegative so Since the  
elasticity is  
a constant for all values tion is  
\(hence the name\). The inverse-demand func-  
Note that because elasticity is constant, from \(7.15\) the marginal rev-  
enue will always be positive or will always be negative for all values of  
\(unless by chance in which case it is zero for all values  
of \). Thus, this function usually violates Assumption 7.1, part \(iv\),  
because either the marginal revenue is always positive so or  
the marginal revenue is always negative, so both extreme points  
of the set \(unless, again the elasticity is exactly one, in which case  
all values of are revenue maximizing\). From this standpoint, it is a  
somewhat ill behaved demand model in pricing-optimization problems,  
though in cases where revenue functions are combined with cost func-  
tions this behavior is less problematic.  
The multiproduct constant elasticity model is 326 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where the matrix of coefficients price elasticities among the products, since  
defines the cross \(and own\)  
Note that the inverse-demand function **p\(d\)** exists if the matrix B  
is invertible, since \(here  
and log\(·\) is a strictly increasing function.  
**7.3.3.4 Logit Demand**  
The logit demand function is based on the MNL model of Sec-  
tion 7.2.2.3. Recall that in the MNL the utility of each alternative  
is assumed to be of the form  
where is the mean utility of choice and is an i.i.d., random-noise  
term with a Gumbel distribution with mean zero and scale parameter  
one. For the logit-demand function, we also include a no-purchase alter-  
native \(indexed by zero\) with utility  
where is an independent Gumbel random variable with mean zero  
and scale parameter 1. Since utility is ordinal, without loss of generality  
we can assume The choice probabilities are then given by \(7.6\)  
with the no-purchase alternative having a value  
As mentioned, it is common to model as a linear function of several  
known attributes including price. Assuming the representative compo-  
nent of utility is linear in price and interpreting the choice probabili-  
ties as fractions of a population of customers of size *N* lead to the class  
of logit-demand functions.  
For example, in the scalar case, we assume and this gives  
rise to a demand function of the form  
where *N* is the market size, is the probability that a  
customer buys at price , and is a coefficient of the price sensitivity.  
The function is defined for all nonnegative so There  
is no closed-form expression for the inverse-demand function, but it is  
easy to see that is strictly decreasing in so the inverse exists and  
is well defined. *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 327  
In the multiple-product case, the demand function is given by  
where again is a vector of coefficients and  
is the MNL probability that a customer chooses product as a function  
of the vector of prices **p**.  
One potential problem with the MNL demand model is that it inherits  
the IIA property \(7.7\). This causes problems if groups of products share  
attributes that strongly affect the choice outcome. To illustrate what  
can go wrong, consider the cross-price elasticity of alternative with  
respect to the price of alternative This is given by  
Notice that this cross-price elasticity is not dependent on and therefore  
cross-elasticity is the same for all alternatives other than  
The implications of this constant cross-price elasticity can be illus-  
trated by an example of automobile market shares.10 Consider a pair of  
subcompact cars and an expensive luxury car. If we lower the price of  
one of the subcompact cars by 10%, then \(7.18\) says that the percentage  
change in the demand for the other subcompact car will be the same as  
the percentage change in the demand for the luxury car \(if the other  
subcompact car demand drops by 20%, then the luxury car demand will  
also drop by 20%\). Such behavior is not very realistic. This IIA behav-  
ior stems fundamentally from the i.i.d. assumption on the random-noise  
terms of the MNL model. \(See Berry \[53\] for a discussion, and a  
possible way around these restrictions on cross-price elasticities.\)  
**7.3.4 Stochastic-Demand Functions**  
A deterministic demand function can be used to define a stochas-  
tic model of demand in a variety of ways. In the stochastic case, we let  
10If the population is homogeneous, the choice probabilities represent market share, and the  
MNL can be used to estimate market shares. 328 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
denote the random demand as a function of the price and a  
The three most common random-demand models  
random-noise term are discussed below.  
**7.3.4.1 Additive Uncertainty**  
In the additive model, the demand is a continuous random variable  
of the form  
where is a zero-mean random variable that does not depend on the  
price. In this case, the mean demand is and the noise term shifts  
the demand randomly about this mean.  
Note that this additive disturbance has the property that the elasticity  
of demand depends on This follows since  
where is the deterministic elasticity. So if a realization  
of is less than zero, the elasticity of demand in the stochastic model  
is greater than the deterministic elasticity, and if the realization of is  
greater than zero, it is smaller.  
One potential problem with the additive uncertainty model is that  
demand could be negative if is small and the variance of is large.  
For this reason, the additive model should be used with caution in ap-  
plications where the coefficients of variation for the demand uncertainty  
is high.  
**7.3.4.2 Multiplicative Uncertainty**  
In the multiplicative model, the demand is again a continuous random  
variable but of the form  
where is a nonnegative random variable with mean one that does not  
depend on the price In this case, the mean demand is again and  
the noise term simply scales the mean demand by a random factor.  
For the multiplicative model, the elasticity of demand for any given  
realization of is the same as the deterministic elasticity, since  
where again is the deterministic elasticity. Thus, the random-noise  
term does not affect the elasticity of demand; it affects only the magni-  
tude of demand. *Customer-Behavior and Market-Response Models* 329  
Note also that one can also combine the multiplicative and additive  
uncertainty models, leading to a demand function of the form  
where is a zero-mean random variable and mean random variable.  
is a nonnegative, unit-  
**7.3.4.3 Poisson and Bernoulli Uncertainty**  
Poisson and Bernoulli models of uncertainty are used in the dynamic  
models of demand discussed in Chapter 5. In the Bernoulli model,  
is simply a probability of an arrival in a given period. So is the  
probability that demand is one in a period, and is the probability  
demand is zero. As a result, the mean demand in a period is again  
and we can represent the demand as a random function  
where is a uniform \[0,1\] random variable.  
For example, consider a situation in which the buyer in the period has  
a reservation price that is a random variable with distribution *F*\(*·*\). If  
the firm offers a price of they will sell a unit if which occurs  
with probability This corresponds to setting  
above.  
In the Poisson model, time is continuous, and is treated as a  
stochastic intensity or rate. That is, the probability that we get a unit  
of demand in an interval of time from to is and the  
probability that we see no demand is \(all other events  
have probability \).  
The Poisson and Bernoulli models are useful for several reasons. First,  
they translate a deterministic demand function directly into a stochas-  
tic model, without the need to estimate additional parameters \(such  
as variance\). They also are discrete-demand models—as opposed to the  
continuous demand of the additive and multiplicative models—and more  
closely match the discreteness of demand in many RM applications. At  
the same time, the Poisson and Bernoulli models assume a specific coeffi-  
cient of variation, which may or may not match the observed variability.  
The additive and multiplicative models, in contrast, allow for different  
levels of variability in the model, as the complete distribution of the  
noise term can be specified. 330 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**7.3.4.4 Stochastic Regularity**  
As in the deterministic case, it is useful analytically to make some  
regularity assumptions about the stochastic demand functions. In par-  
ticular\:  
ASSUMPTION 7.6 \(STOCHASTIC-DEMAND-FUNCTION REGULARITY\)  
*The variance of demand is uniformly bounded,*  
*for*  
This condition is not very restrictive and is required only to ensure  
that stochastic optimization problems are well behaved.  
**7.3.5 Rationing Rules**  
A final demand-modeling issue concerns how capacity is allocated to  
customers in cases where demand exceeds supply. For example, suppose  
capacity is 100 units and the firm commits to a fixed price of \$10 per  
unit before knowing the demand realization. If the demand at this price  
turns out to be 120, then what assumptions do we make about which  
customers get the capacity and which do not? Do we assume that the  
capacity is allocated to customers with the highest valuations \(thereby  
increasing the customer surplus\), or should we assume that it is allocated  
randomly—for example, on a first-come, first-serve basis? The rules used  
for allocating capacity to customers when demand exceeds capacity are  
called *rationing rules* in economics.  
There are two classical rationing rules\: \(1\) The *efficient-rationing rule*  
\(also called *parallel rationing*\), in which it is assumed that units are allo-  
cated to customers with the highest valuations, and \(2\) the *proportional-*  
*rationing rule* \(also called *randomized rationing*\), in which it is assumed  
that capacity is allocated randomly, so the allocation is independent of  
the customers’ valuations. While the former is more efficient from a con-  
sumer surplus standpoint, it is difficult to achieve in most posted-price  
settings \(though some types of auctions implement it very well\).  
In quantity-based RM applications the most natural assumption is  
the proportional-rationing rule because when a given product is open,  
it is normally purchased on a first-come first-served basis. Therefore,  
provided there is no correlation between valuations and order of arrival,  
the inventory is sold independent of valuations.

# THE ECONOMICS OF RM  
**8.1 Introduction**  
Many topics traditionally studied by economists are central to un-  
derstanding revenue management. After all‚ using price as a means for  
balancing supply and demand and achieving an efficient allocation of  
goods is one of the central themes of economics. Economic theories  
on rationing‚ free entry‚ price discrimination‚ monopoly pricing‚ pric-  
ing under capacity restrictions‚ oligopoly pricing‚ multiproduct pricing‚  
differentiated products pricing‚ among others‚ provide explanations and  
predictions of price formation under various market conditions. This  
body of work is more theoretical than operational in nature but pro-  
vides fundamental insights into RM—insights that are often lost in the  
morass of operational details surrounding the main-stream RM method-  
ology that has been our focus thus far.  
While economic theory has much to say about RM practice‚ at the  
same time RM is an anomaly of sorts‚ insofar that the practice often  
deviates from classical economic predictions in important respects. For  
example‚ on the one hand‚ products such as airline seats are widely con-  
sidered to be commodities and the markets free \(for example‚ the service  
is not highly differentiated‚ competition is fierce‚ prices are transparent‚  
efficient electronic markets exist in the form of central reservation sys-  
tems‚ and so on\); yet prices exhibit wide dispersion and are far from  
being equal to marginal cost even under intense competition. What  
can explain this? Is it that airline markets are not as competitive as  
one might imagine‚ and the practice of RM is just a manifestation of  
monopoly price discrimination? Alternatively‚ can it be explained by  
other factors‚ such as high fixed costs or uncertain and variable de- 334 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
mand? How can airlines and hotels sustain the sale of the same physical  
product at multiple prices in a competitive market?  
Indeed‚ many papers in the economics literature point to airline RM as  
an example of price discrimination—a monopoly practice—while others  
cite the deregulation of the airline industry and the subsequent drop  
in prices \(on average\) as a model of the benefits of a competitive free  
market. Which is it? Similarly‚ while retail markdown pricing might  
look like monopoly price skimming‚ retailing is notoriously competitive‚  
especially in this modern era of transparent online prices. So should we  
use the monopoly or competitive explanation of pricing in this industry?  
Unfortunately‚ the answer to such questions is often “all of the above‚”  
in the sense that in most real-world RM contexts there are many eco-  
nomic forces at work operating at different levels and different time  
scales. Economic theory‚ in contrast‚ tends to isolate and study one ef-  
fect at a time. This fact is important to keep in mind when reading this  
chapter.  
Still‚ one can attempt to organize RM practice in a hierarchy‚ similar  
to what was discussed in Chapter 1. At a high level‚ RM can be consid-  
ered to be a three-stage “game.” In the first stage‚ firms make structural  
design decisions. They may design their products based on customer  
preferences‚ on existing competitive products‚ or in anticipation of new  
products that might be offered by rivals. For instance‚ a retailer making  
stocking decisions prior to a season decides what assortments‚ styles‚ and  
colors to stock. An airline picks its routes and schedules and may create  
discount products with restrictions as a result of the entry \(or threat of  
entry\) of a low-cost carrier. A hotel picks its location‚ the quality and  
size of its rooms‚ the level of service it offers‚ and so forth.  
In the next stage‚ firms may commit to either a quantity or price  
decision. A retailer might commit to an order quantity before the start  
of a sales season; a hotel commits to the number of rooms it provides;  
an airline commits to a flight schedule and an assignment of aircraft  
to each route‚ and so on. Firms may commit to prices as well. For  
example‚ as mentioned in earlier chapters‚ airlines typically commit to  
market-level prices for a wide range of flight departures. \(This fact is the  
basis for the exogenous-price assumptions in the classic single-resource  
and network RM problems.\) This is done both for advertising purposes  
\(say‚ to advertise only one fare for all flights in a market\)‚ for competitive  
reasons \(say‚ to match a marketwide fare offered by a competitor\)‚ and  
for administrative reasons—such as reducing the complexity and cost of  
managing pricing decisions.  
Once these precommitment decisions are made‚ firms may have some  
recourse decision that allows them to adjust to changes in market con- *The Economics of RM* 335  
ditions. Again‚ this might be a price or quantity recourse decision‚ and  
the scope and flexibility of the recourse decisions vary from industry  
to industry. For example‚ the ability to change prices often depends  
on the channels used\: price changes may be rapid and costless in an  
electronic distribution channel \(such as a central reservation systems or  
website\) but may be much less flexible in physical channels like retail  
stores. Also‚ prices may have to be fixed if they are advertised heav-  
ily or have to be published in a physical catalog. If prices are rigid‚  
firms may be able to adjust their quantity decisions—how much to sell‚  
to whom‚ and through which channels. Again‚ this is the situation in  
the classical quantity-based RM industries like airlines and hotels. The  
ability to use quantity as a recourse decision is highly dependent on the  
type of product and the technology and costs of production and distri-  
bution. Airlines and hotels benefit from the fact that their “products”  
\(different fare classes and rate categories\) are all supplied by the same  
physical inventory; hence‚ they have a high degree of flexibility in re-  
allocating capacity. In contrast‚ an automaker cannot use subcompact  
cars to satisfy demand for luxury vehicles and therefore has much less  
quantity flexibility. As another example‚ while retailers can in theory  
reallocate stock from one store to another as a recourse‚ often they find  
the handling and transportation costs prohibitive.  
At each of these three stages of the game—structural design‚ pre-  
commitment and recourse—economic forces come into play. And the  
nature of the market often changes dramatically from one stage to the  
next; firms may face a highly competitive decision at the precommit-  
ment stage but enjoy near monopoly power once they reach the recourse  
stage—or vice versa. Although analyzing a complete model of RM—  
from product design to the final recourse decisions—is currently beyond  
the field’s technical scope‚ as a start one can construct simple models  
that isolate one or two stages of the game and impose one or two relevant  
variations at a time. Taking this point of view‚ there is indeed a rich  
body of economics work that becomes relevant to RM.  
In particular‚ economic analysis allows us to address the following  
resource-level questions\: How would a monopoly set the multiple prices  
in quantity-based RM? How do they compare with single prices? Is there  
equilibrium in capacity‚ allocations‚ and prices for two competing firms  
practicing RM? Why do firms fix prices and manipulate allocations in  
quantity-based RM?  
We can also address the following industry-structure and competition  
questions\: Why does an industry have products with such similar restric-  
tions for the sale of its products? Is there an equilibrium in the *types* of 336 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
restrictions? Is RM the best sale mechanism for a monopolist? What  
about in an oligopoly? Why do we see “price wars” or “fare sales”?  
Finally‚ economic theory provides insights into the following welfare  
and regulatory questions\: Does RM provide the optimum number of  
products \(variety\) for customers \(as would a welfare maximizer\)? Can  
RM be sustained under perfect competition? Is dynamic pricing con-  
ducive to tactical collusion? Does RM increase overall welfare? Is it  
beneficial to the consumer \(increasing total consumer surplus\)?  
This remainder of the chapter looks at these questions and is organized  
as follows. The next three sections \(Sections 8.2– 8.4\) look at economic  
models of RM and pricing by market conditions\: perfect competition‚  
monopoly‚ and oligopoly. The strategic variables in each case could be  
price or quantity—or both. For instance‚ capacity might be chosen first‚  
followed by price competition. For each market condition‚ we start with  
the basic economic models and then specialize to models that incorporate  
additional features relevant to RM industries.  
For the sake of the reader not familiar with standard economics mod-  
els of competition‚ we begin with the basics‚ though our coverage here  
is brief. Also‚ some basic notions of game theory are assumed in the dis-  
cussion that follows. Appendix F provides a primer on game theory‚ and  
the Notes and Sources section at the end of this chapter has additional  
references.  
**8.2 Perfect Competition**  
*Perfect competition* represents an extreme form of market competi-  
tion in which the decisions of individual firms are severely constrained  
by market forces. It should be considered more as an abstraction of  
market conditions than a literal model of real world markets‚ though  
some centralized financial and commodity markets do come close to  
achieving perfect competition. Here we briefly review the assumptions  
of the competitive-market model and then examine some variations of  
the model relevant to RM.  
**8.2.1 Perfectly Competitive Markets**  
A market under perfect competition has two main characteristics.  
The first is that the goods produced by all firms are *commodities*—  
defined formally as goods for which customers exhibit no preference over  
the source of supply. In other words‚ customers simply do not care  
from whom they buy a commodity. A bushel of wheat‚ a gallon of  
gasoline‚ a megawatt of electricity or a share of IBM stock—all are goods  
typically considered to be commodities. Note that simply saying “goods *The Economics of RM* 337  
are identical” is not sufficient to define a commodity. For example‚ you  
may prefer gas station *A* to gas station *B* simply because station *A* is  
located on your side of the road and station *B* is not. So factors like  
location‚ timing of availability \(such as winter fruit from the Southern  
Hemisphere\)‚ terms of trade‚ and costs of switching suppliers may create  
preferences for suppliers even if the goods themselves are identical. Most  
often in real world markets‚ perfect competition arises only when goods  
are traded in a centralized \(physical or virtual\) location and the terms  
of trade are standardized. Were you to buy shares of IBM stock on  
the New York Stock Exchange‚ you would have no idea who previously  
owned these shares—and would most likely not care to know either.  
Such a situation defines a true commodity market.  
If a firm is selling a commodity‚ it cannot control the price at which  
it sells. This follows because if a firm were to demand a price even  
marginally higher than the market price‚ then customers would simply  
buy from an alternative \(and perfectly equivalent\) source‚ and the firm’s  
demand would drop to zero. Conversely‚ a firm has no incentive to sell  
at less than the market price either because customers are willing to pay  
it the same market price as other \(again perfectly equivalent\) sources.  
Thus‚ in a perfectly competitive market firms are simply *price takers‚*  
able to sell at the market price but unable to directly control this price.  
This feature of competitive markets is also referred to as the *law of one*  
*price.*  
The second key characteristic of a perfectly competitive market is that  
there are a large number of firms and each supplies only a negligible frac-  
tion of the total supply. The key assumption here is that the individual  
quantity decisions of a firm have no impact on the market price \(each  
firm is only a drop in the bucket of total supply‚ as it were\). For example‚  
selling your 100 shares of IBM will have a negligible impact on the price  
of IBM because upward of 10 million shares might be traded in a single  
day. This is to be contrasted with the case of oligopolistic commodity  
markets \(see the discussion of Cournot competition in Section 8.4.1.1\)‚  
where there are several large firms that—while not directly controlling  
the market price—can influence it because their volume represents a sig-  
nificant fraction of the total market \(for example‚ how much oil Saudi  
Arabia decides to sell on the world oil market influences the price of oil‚  
even if Saudi companies cannot demand a price higher than the market  
price\). 338 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**8.2.2 Firm-Level Decisions Under Perfect**  
# Competition  
Under perfect competition‚ firms can sell as much as they want at  
the market price1‚ and the only factors limiting a firm’s output are their  
own capacity constraints or costs of production. More precisely‚ if is  
the market price‚ is the quantity supplied‚ and is the firm’s cost  
function \(either direct or opportunity costs or both\)—which we assume  
for simplicity is increasing and convex—then a firm in a competitive  
market chooses its quantity by solving  
which leads \(assuming an interior solution\) to the first-order condition  
Hence‚ the market price is equal to the marginal cost of production for  
each firm supplying the market. Note that the firm’s decisions are en-  
tirely supply-driven in this case—based only on their technology and  
costs of production rather than any demand-side considerations. There-  
fore‚ under the competitive model it would seem there is little scope for  
the sorts of demand decisions that lie at the heart of RM. Yet as we  
show below‚ adding some small modifications to the competitive model  
leads to interesting insights about RM practices.  
If marginal costs are constant the first-order profit con-  
dition reduces to in other words‚ the market price just covers  
the marginal cost of production‚ and hence firms earn zero profit. This  
fact leads to the so-called *zero-profit equilibrium‚* in which a zero-profit  
condition for all firms is assumed as essentially the “definition” of a com-  
petitive market. The zero-profit equilibrium is a convenient assumption‚  
obviating the need to perform a complex game-theoretic analysis of a  
large number of competing firms‚ and in places we assume it in this  
section. But this assumption in not completely innocuous and arguably  
oversimplifies the effects of competition.  
**8.2.3 Precommitment and Demand Uncertainty**  
One important modification of the perfect-competition model occurs  
when firms precommit to capacity and price in a market where aggregate  
demand is uncertain. We have already mentioned several examples of  
1Here, the phrase “selling as much as they want” should be interpreted in light of the as-  
sumption that the maximum quantity any firm would choose to supply is still a negligible  
fraction of the total market supply. *The Economics of RM* 339  
RM industries where both precommitment and demand uncertainty are  
central features of the industry.  
To see the effect that these factors have, consider a commodity market.  
Let be the marginal cost of adding one more unit of capacity and be  
the marginal cost of serving an additional customer. Further, suppose  
that a firm precommits to both the capacity it provides, and the  
price it charges, Finally, assume that aggregate market demand, *D,*  
is uncertain. However, the market is competitive, so each firm earns  
zero profit in equilibrium. We show that under these conditions, the  
law of one price breaks down, and different firms may offer different  
prices \(price dispersion\)—or a single firm may sell the same commodity  
at multiple prices, a situation reminiscent of traditional quantity-based  
RM.  
To take a simple concrete case, suppose the total market demand *D* is  
with probability \(the low-demand scenario\) and with probability  
\(the high-demand scenario\). Then consider the following perfectly  
competitive equilibrium\: the total market capacity is with units  
priced at a low price and the remaining units priced at a high  
price Note that because customers \(as in any commodity  
market\) have no preference for the source of supply, they first buy from  
the firm with the lowest price \(those pricing at Since  
these low-price firms always sell out and earn a per-unit  
profit of  
On the other hand‚ if demand is high a total of customers  
will be forced to buy from the high-price firms at a price of  
\(We assume for simplicity in this example that all customers are willing  
to buy at this price.\) However‚ these suppliers also earn an expected  
per-unit profit of zero‚ since  
In effect‚ the high-price firms “specialize” in supplying the market in  
the high-demand scenario. Their high prices compensate them for not  
selling as often‚ yet on average they earn the same zero profit as their  
low-price competitors. Note that this equilibrium is also beneficial to  
customers in the sense that it meets demand under all scenarios.  
This same outcome can be interpreted in a way that even more closely  
resembles quantity-based RM; namely‚ each individual firm could price  
half of its output at and the other half at The firm would then sell  
its low-price allocation under both scenarios but would sell the high-price  
allocation only under the high-demand scenario. 340 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
This example of price dispersion in zero-profit equilibrium was first  
pointed out by Prescott \[428\] and is referred to as the *Prescott equilib-*  
*rium.* To generalize the result‚ let denote the fraction of customers  
with reservation values less than \(the reservation-price distribution\)‚  
and let *N* denote the market size‚ so is the aggregate-demand  
function. Suppose *N* is a discrete random variable‚ taking on discrete  
levels with Then  
Prescott \[428\] shows that the unique competitive equilibrium involves  
price dispersion and is given by the set of prices  
and corresponding capacities  
Again‚ this could be interpreted as each firm specializing and offering one  
of the prices or as individual firms offering a menu of price levels and  
limiting the quantity they sell at each price point. Dana \[142\] extends  
this equilibrium to the case where the market size has a continuous  
distribution‚ in which case the equilibrium then has a continuum of  
prices.  
The main point is that by simply introducing two features into the  
classical competitive model—capacity and price precommitment and  
aggregate-demand uncertainty—the law of one price breaks down‚ and  
price dispersion \(either among firms or within a single firm\) is the unique  
competitive equilibrium. Moreover‚ as Dana \[142\] points out‚ this equi-  
librium provides one possible explanation for classical airline RM‚ as it  
clearly reflects the important characteristics of multiple prices and ca-  
pacity controls on the quantity sold at each price. The important feature  
to emphasize here is that the prices and capacity controls arise because  
of precommitment and demand uncertainty alone; they are not used to  
achieve other objectives like price discrimination or revenue maximiza-  
tion per se.2  
2Though a firm may still price to break even‚ which may require maximizing its profits to  
avoid a loss. *The Economics of RM* 341  
**8.2.4 Peak-Load Pricing Under Perfect**  
# Competition  
RM is strongly associated with service industries. Because services  
are not storable‚ the capacity that a firm provides in one period cannot  
be used to supply demand in future periods‚ and the manufacturer’s  
classic strategy of building inventory to meet future demand is not an  
option. Consequently‚ any capacity level the firm chooses may turn out  
to be excessive during low-demand periods and inadequate during high-  
demand periods.  
Peak-load pricing is one solution to this dilemma. The basic idea  
is to try to level out demand by pricing differently in peak and off-  
peak periods‚ thereby achieving more efficient capacity utilization. Peak-  
load pricing has been extensively studied by economists \(see Crew et  
al. \[136\]\)‚ both in the context of regulated industries \(electric utilities‚  
postal service‚ telecom\) and in degregulated contexts. It provides one  
economic explanation for classical quantity-based RM practices and also  
explains differential pricing in other contexts. We first look at the case  
where peak periods can be identified a priori and then discuss the case  
where the peak period is uncertain.  
**8.2.5 Identifiable Peak Periods**  
Here we consider a simple model of peak-load pricing‚ due to  
Bergstrom and MacKie-Mason \[51\]‚ in which the peak period is known.  
There are two periods\: period 1 is the peak period‚ and period 2 is the  
off-peak period \(a Friday versus Saturday flight‚ weekday versus week-  
end hotel night‚ prime-time versus late-night TV slot‚ and so on\). A firm  
must first select a capacity for use in both periods‚ and the demand  
served in each period denoted cannot exceed this capacity. The unit  
capacity cost is and the unit variable cost for servicing customers is  
Bergstrom and MacKie-Mason \[51\] assume that customers have a utility  
for consumption that is homothetic \(a utility function that can  
be written as where is a monotonically increasing  
function and is homogeneous of degree 1\)‚ twice differentiable and  
strictly concave.  
Denote the marginal rate of substitution between peak and nonpeak  
consumption by 342 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Assume that the firm is in a competitive market and is constrained to  
operate at zero profit.3  
Under the assumptions on the utility‚ given any prices on the  
peak and off-peak periods‚ respectively‚ demand will be determined by  
the same ratio of prices. That is‚ the demand function satisfies  
Define the function implicitly by so that  
is the ratio of demand for the peak period to demand for the non-peak  
period corresponding to a price ratio of Because period 1  
is the peak period‚ we assume that is‚ demand for period  
1 is higher than demand for period 2 when both are priced the same.  
For any such that there exists a unique set of equilibrium  
prices and demands that makes the peak demand equal to  
capacity.  
The following simple example from Bergstrom and MacKie-Mason \[51\]  
illustrates this equilibrium\:  
**Example 8.1** \(PEAK-LOAD PRICING WITH SUBSTITUTION\) Suppose the marginal cost  
is zero and customers’ utility is linear of the form  
so customers value a unit from the peak period twice as much as a unit from the  
off-peak period. If the firm used only a single price‚ all customers would buy in the  
peak period‚ and therefore by the zero-profit constraint the firm would have to charge  
a price of to recover its capacity cost \(the price would be set equal to the  
marginal cost of capacity\).  
Now consider the effect of allowing the firm to charge different prices in each  
period. In this case‚ so the ratio of prices is also At  
this ratio of prices‚ customers are indifferent between the peak and off-peak periods  
because although they value the peak twice as much‚ its price is twice as high. Hence‚  
they split their consumption evenly over both periods. In this case‚ the firm sells all  
its output in both periods‚ and therefore by the zero profit condition it must have  
to recover its capacity cost. Combining this condition with the fact that  
implies that and both prices are strictly less than the  
marginal cost of capacity.  
Notice in this example that by using peak-load pricing‚ the firm uses  
strictly lower prices in both the peak and nonpeak periods compared  
with uniform pricing. Thus‚ the differential pricing benefits customers.  
3Bergstrom and MacKie-Mason \[51\] allow the slightly more general assumption that the firm  
is constrained to operate at a fixed return on capital‚ which could be due to either regulation  
or competition. *The Economics of RM* 343  
However‚ this is not always the case. Other utility functions lead to  
peak-period prices that are higher than those charged under uniform  
pricing \(though the off-peak price is always lower\).  
As for the impact on capacity‚ peak-load pricing is commonly thought  
to reduce the amount of capacity a firm provides because customers are  
encouraged to shift their consumption from peak to off-peak periods.  
However‚ as in Example 8.1 above‚ peak-load pricing may lower prices  
in all periods‚ which can stimulate overall demand relative to uniform  
pricing. If the demand stimulation effect of these price reductions is  
strong enough‚ the capacity provided by the firm may actually increase  
to meet the increased demand. Bergstrom and MacKie-Mason \[51\] show  
that whether capacity increases or decreases under peak-load pricing  
depends in a simple way on the price elasticity of demand.  
**8.2.6 Uncertainty over the Timing of Peak Loads**  
The above analysis assumes the firm knows which periods are peak  
and which are off-peak. However, a firm may face uncertainty about the  
periods customers prefer. For example, a heat wave may cause a surge in  
the demand for electricity on random days or a surprise play-off victory  
by a football team may cause a jump in demand for flights to, and hotels  
in, the winning team’s home town. With random peaks like this, it is  
not possible to set peak prices *ex ante* as in the previous section. So how  
should a firm in this situation respond? Here we look at a model from  
Dana \[143\] that addresses this question, as the results closely resemble  
classical quantity-based RM. For concreteness, we place the work in the  
context of airlines, but the model applies more generally.  
Consider a market with two flight times, morning and afternoon,  
which are served using the same aircraft \(same capacity\); sales occur  
over two periods. The cost to supply a single unit of capacity, which  
can be used at both flight times, is \(or per-unit-per-flight\), and the  
variable cost to serve each customer is \(incurred only when the unit  
is sold\). Firms precommit to both their prices and the capacity they  
provide at each price, as in the Prescott model.  
There are *N* customers who want to fly on these flights, but one  
departure time \(the peak time\) is more popular than the other,  
will prefer the peak flight, and will prefer the off-peak flight, with  
and The customers’ preferred flight is \(in  
the aggregate\) uncertain, however; specifically, we assume that with  
probability 1/2, customers prefer the morning flight and prefer  
the afternoon flight, while with probability 1/2 the reverse is true\:  
prefer the afternoon flight, and prefer the morning flight. The flight  
capacity is *N/*2. 344 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Customers have identical utility for travel but have heterogeneous  
disutility *\(waiting cost\)* for traveling at their less preferred time. is  
assumed to be an i.i.d. random variable with a continuous distribution  
function defined on The waiting costs are assumed uncorre-  
lated with the preferred flight time. We call customers with waiting costs  
*leisure customers* \(*L*\) and those with waiting costs *busi-*  
*ness customers* \(*B*\). Let and denote,  
respectively, the number of leisure and business customers.4 Customers  
arrive in random order to make their purchases \(proportional rationing,  
Section 7.3.5\).  
Dana \[143\] shows that if so some customers are always willing  
to pay the capacity cost to fly at their preferred time, there exists a  
unique competitive equilibrium for this model in which units are  
offered at each flight time at a high price and units are  
offered at each flight time at a low price where  
and  
Arriving customers buy their preferred flight as long as the low price is  
available. Once the low-price seats sell out‚ however‚ leisure customers  
will buy their less preferred flight at the low price because their waiting  
cost is less than the price premium of for the high-price units on  
their preferred flight. Business customers‚ however‚ would rather pay  
the higher price on their preferred flight because their waiting cost  
is greater than the price differential In this way‚ customers with low  
waiting costs \(leisure customers\) are shifted to the off-peak flight‚ while  
customers with high waiting costs \(business customers\) are accommo-  
dated on the peak flight. Moreover‚ note that this shifting of demand  
occurs without firms’ prior knowledge of which flight time is preferred  
by customers.  
The model also has interesting implications as to which customers  
benefit from the differential pricing equilibrium in the case when  
\(everyone prefers the peak flight\). In this case‚ the expected price paid  
4This sort of law-of-large-numbers assumption concerning individual uncertainty is typical  
of many economics models; for example‚ it is the reason that in Chapter 5 we express a  
deterministic demand function as where *N* is the market size and  
is the distribution of individual’s reservation prices. It is reasonable if the population is large. *The Economics of RM* 345  
by business customers is given by  
which is decreasing in the number of leisure customers and is strictly  
less than which would be the equilibrium price if business cus-  
tomers were to be served separately.5 Thus‚ business travelers pay less  
than they would if they were to be served without leisure customers‚ and  
the more leisure customers‚ the lower the average price paid by business  
customers. Leisure customers pay a price of but are sometimes  
forced to fly at their less preferred time‚ and as a result one can show  
that leisure customers have an expected utility that is decreasing in the  
number of business customers \(the more business customers‚ the  
worse things are for leisure customers because they are forced to fly at  
less preferred times more often\).  
For these reasons‚ this model suggests that in quantity-based RM‚ it  
may be that it is leisure customers who subsidize business customers—  
and not the other way around—despite the fact that business customers  
are the ones paying more on average. The following remark of a Marriott  
Hotels manager reinforces this point of view\:  
The fact of the matter is, if it weren’t for incremental leisure guests, business  
guests would have to pay a higher price for their rooms in order for the hotel  
to meet financial obligations. I’d like to offer all our guests a \$79 room, but  
in order to cover the costs of the hotel and ensure returns to our investors  
we must differentiate. The bottom line is this\: either we accommodate both  
guests, one paying \$79 and one paying \$125, or we ask the business guest to  
pay \$145.6  
**8.2.7 Advance Purchases in Competitive Markets**  
A common feature of quantity-based RM is the use of reservations and  
advance-purchase discounts. But why do such discounts exist‚ and what  
economic purpose do reservations serve? Here we look at an explanation  
based on the competitive model proposed by Dana \[141\]. The model can  
be viewed as an extension to Prescott’s model of Section 8.2.3 that adds  
several essential features of advance-purchase markets. We provide a  
simplified example of Dana’s model‚ described in the airline context.  
5This follows since business travelers are willing to pay more than the capacity cost per  
customer if loads were balanced‚ to fly on their preferred flight; hence‚ the business-customers-  
only equilibrium has all business customers traveling on the peak flight at a cost per customer  
of  
6This quote is from Richard Hank in *Yield Management\: Strategies and Tactics‚* Educational  
Institute of the American Hotel and Motel Association‚ 1990 \(Dana \[143\]\). 346 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
The key feature of the model is that there are two types of customers—  
those who are certain early on of their need to travel but who have low  
valuations \(such as leisure travelers\) and those with a high degree of  
uncertainty early on about their need to travel but with high valuations  
given the need to travel \(such as business travelers\). Let *B* denote the  
business customers and *L* denote the leisure customers‚ with willingness  
to pay \(given the need to travel\) of and respectively‚ where  
Let and denote the number of type *B* and *L* customers‚  
respectively.  
Sales take place in two periods. Period 1 is an advance-purchase  
period where the product can be purchased for later consumption in  
period 2. In period 2 there is a spot market where the product can  
also be purchased for subsequent consumption. Customers are served in  
random order in each period \(proportional rationing‚ Section 7.3.5\).  
The demand of low-valuation customers is certain; that is‚ all  
customers are sure they want to travel in period 2. However‚ the demand  
of high-valuation customers is subject to two types of uncertainty. First‚  
the aggregate number of business customers is uncertain. We assume  
there is a population of total business travelers and aggregate-  
demand states each occurring with probability where  
In demand state out of the business customers  
want to travel. We assume demand states are ordered so that  
Second‚ we assume each type *B* customer has individual uncertainty  
about the need to travel.7 Let denote the conditional proba-  
bility that a type *B* customer wants to travel in aggregate demand state  
The number of customers is assumed large‚ however‚ so exactly  
customers will want to purchase in period 2 in aggregate-demand state  
The unconditional probability that a type *B* customer wants to travel‚  
denoted is then given by  
On the supply side, the production costs are the same as in the  
Prescott model; there is a marginal cost of capacity which is incurred  
whether service is provided or not, and a marginal cost of service which  
is incurred only if service is provided. Further, firms must precommit to  
both their capacities and prices in the two periods.  
7Dana \[141\]’s full model allows for individual uncertainty over the need to travel among both  
types of customers as well as aggregate uncertainty over the number of customers of each  
type. He also allows for parallel as well as proportional rationing. *The Economics of RM* 347  
**8.2.7.1 Equilibrium Without Advance Purchase**  
We first consider the equilibrium of this model without an advance-  
purchase market‚ in which all customers are served in a single spot mar-  
ket. This situation is simply the Prescott equilibrium of Section 8.2.3.  
Specifically‚ there will be prices offered in the spot market given by  
the Prescott prices \(8.1\). We illustrate this outcome with an example\:  
**Example 8.2** \(Dana \[141\]\) Suppose there are leisure customers with  
valuations and business customers with valuations  
The aggregate number of business customers takes on three states,  
each with probability 1/3 for all The capacity cost is  
and the variable cost of service is The resulting equilibrium prices, capacities,  
and sales are shown in Table 8.1.  
The prices in Table 8.1 follow from \(8.1\). In demand state 3, there are 100 total  
customers, no business customers and leisure customers, all of  
whom are willing to purchase at the \$6 price. In demand states 1 and 2, only business  
customers will purchase at the higher prices because they value travel at  
which is greater than and while leisure customers value travel only at  
which is less than both and However, by proportional rationing, a fraction  
of the low-price \(\$6\) units sell to business customers. Thus, in state the  
residual number of business customers remaining after the low-price units sell out is  
In demand state 2 this residual demand is equal to 50; hence, the market  
provides an additional 50 units at the price In demand state 1  
the residual business demand is 225, of which 50 units are sold at the market provides an additional 175 units at the highest price hence,  
to satisfy  
demand in this last state. Note that for all units, however, the expected price is equal  
to the capacity cost of \$6.  
**8.2.7.2 Equilibrium with Advance Purchase**  
Now consider the same model with an advance-purchase market. We  
assume that resale is prohibited‚ so customers buy for their own use and  
not for speculation. Further‚ we assume that a firm that sells an advance-  
purchase ticket must provide a unit of capacity and then service each  
such purchase. Let denote the price in the advance-purchase market. 348 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Then the zero-profit condition implies that the advance-purchase price  
must be The prices in the second period will then follow a  
Prescott-like equilibrium and will in general be no less than because  
of the aggregate-demand uncertainty.  
Now consider the effect on leisure \(type *L*\) customers. Since they face  
an expected price greater than in period 2‚ the leisure customers  
\(who are certain to want to travel\) prefer purchasing in the advance-  
purchase market. If a business customers \(type *B*\) purchases in ad-  
vance‚ their expected surplus is which they compare with the  
expected surplus they get if they purchase in period 2. This surplus is  
provided the prices for all 8  
\(The term inside the parentheses  
is simply the type *B* value minus the expected price paid in demand  
state this is multiplied by the probability a type *B* will want to travel  
and the demand state is If the business customers choose period 2‚  
then the advance-purchase mechanism segments the market. The result  
is easiest to see by continuing Example 8.2\:  
**Example 8.3** Consider the data given in Example 8.2‚ but suppose there exists an  
advance-purchase market. Table 8.2 shows the equilibrium prices and capacities that  
result.  
The table is explained as follows. Note that 100 units are provided in the advance-  
purchase market; the leisure \(type *L*\) customers buy these 100 units. The equilibrium  
prices in period 2 are also shown and are identical to those in Example 8.2. The  
equilibrium sales follow assuming only business \(type *B*\) customers purchase in period  
2\. Since there are of these customers who want to purchase‚ in state 1‚ 100  
units are sold at and the remaining 200 type *B* customer purchase at the highest  
price in state 2‚ 100 units are sold at a price in state 3‚ no units  
are sold.  
To verify that type *B* customer will indeed purchase in period 2‚ note they have  
an unconditional probability  
of needing to travel. Hence‚ their expected surplus in the advance-purchase market is  
while their expected surplus if they purchase in period 2 is  
Since this later surplus is clearly greater \(and positive\)‚ the type *B* customers prefer  
to purchase in period 2 as claimed. *The Economics of RM* 349  
This example is not unique. Indeed‚ Dana \[141\] shows the market is  
always segmented provided This is true regardless of the values  
and and holds for all distributions of aggregate uncertainty; type *B*  
customers always buy in period 2‚ while type *L* customers always prefer  
buying in the advance-purchase market. In particular‚ it is not necessary  
to have valuations correlated with individual demand uncertainty as in  
our examples. This segmentation outcome is also the unique competitive  
equilibrium.  
Finally‚ note that comparing Examples 8.2 and 8.3‚ the leisure \(type  
*L*\) customers significantly benefit from the advance-purchase market;  
they are never rationed out of the market \(as they are in the spot-market  
case\)‚ and they pay lower prices.  
**8.3 Monopoly Pricing**  
A *monopoly* arises when a single firm \(the *monopolist*\) becomes the  
exclusive provider of a given product or service. It is the polar opposite  
of the competitive-market model because a monopoly firm dominates  
its market and can dictate the terms of trade‚ including both prices  
and quantities. A monopoly firm has considerable market power and—  
unless regulated—attempts to extract the maximum possible profit from  
its market.  
Like the model of perfect competition‚ a perfect monopoly is essen-  
tially a theoretical abstraction‚ as often‚ viable substitutes exist that  
reduce the market power of a monopolist. To take an airline example‚  
if the price of a short-haul flight is too high‚ potential customers may  
choose to drive or take the train instead. Such a carrier may find it-  
self without much market power despite the fact that it is nominally a  
monopolist. On the other hand‚ the same carrier in a long-haul market  
would likely ignore the competition from automobile and train modes of  
transport. Therefore‚ the extent of monopoly power often depends on  
the availability and quality of substitutes. Alternatively‚ one can view  
8If the equilibrium price and their surplus in state exceeds the customers’ valuation then customers will not buy‚  
is zero. Thus‚ the corresponding terms in the sum will be zero. 350 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
substitute products as making the monopolist’s aggregate demand more  
price elastic.  
Even if a monopolist has significant market power‚ the possibility of  
entry by competitors may reduce its pricing power. That is‚ the monop-  
olist may have to price low enough to discourage potential competitors  
from entering its market. For instance‚ going back to the airline ex-  
ample‚ if a monopoly carrier made disproportionately high profits‚ its  
success would likely tempt other carriers to enter its market and provide  
competing service. Anticipating the competition and the lower profits  
that would result‚ the monopolist might conclude it is better off in the  
end to price less aggressively. Indeed‚ if the threat of entry is severe—  
the so-called case of *free entry*—the monopolist might even be forced to  
price *as if* it were in a competitive market. This phenomenon is called  
*contestability*—or *monopolistic competition*—and has had considerable  
influence on the economic debate surrounding market regulation.  
In this section‚ we begin by examining pricing of a single product  
in a perfect monopoly. Next‚ we look into reasons for a monopolist to  
use multiple prices and practice price discrimination—a commonly cited  
explanation for RM practices.  
**8.3.1 Single-Price Monopoly**  
The monopolist is assumed to know the aggregate \(deterministic\) de-  
mand as a function of price‚ Let be the inverse-demand func-  
tion and the cost of producing items. We assume that  
and are twice differentiable functions‚ is an increasing function‚  
and is a decreasing function. Then the monopolist’s problem is to  
set a price to maximize its profit‚ defined as  
Taking the derivative of *V*\(·\) with respect and setting the result to  
zero‚ we obtain the following necessary condition for the optimal price  
where recall from Chapter 7 that is the marginal  
revenue defined by \(7.14\). The firm will produce \(and sell\) the quantity  
at The conditions \(8.3\) says that at the optimal price‚  
marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.9 We call the *optimal*  
9Note that under perfect competition the price is equal to marginal cost‚ whereas for a  
monopoly the price will exceed the marginal cost‚ and hence the quantity produced will be  
lower. The resulting welfare loss is called the *deadweight loss of monopoly.* *The Economics of RM* 351  
*unconstrained price* for a monopolist selling a single product at a single  
price. The following example illustrates this calculation\:  
**Example 8.4** \(LINEAR-DEMAND FUNCTION\) Consider the demand function  
where is a constant. Let be a constant marginal cost Then the  
profit function for the monopolist is given by  
The single price that maximizes *V*\(*·*\) is \(differentiating *V*\(·\)  
with respect to and setting the result to zero\), and the optimal quantity is  
We can also rewrite \(8.3\) in terms of demand elasticity at  
to obtain  
The left-hand side can be interpreted as the profit margin \(ratio of the  
price in excess of the marginal cost to price\)‚ while the right-hand side  
is the inverse of the magnitude of demand elasticity. Hence‚ the more  
elastic the demand‚ the lower the monopolist’s profit margin.  
**8.3.2 Monopoly with Capacity Constraints**  
If the monopolist faces capacity constraints‚ it may affect its opti-  
mal price. In particular‚ this will occur if the aggregate demand at the  
optimal unconstrained price exceeds the capacity‚ in which case the mo-  
nopolist will want to set a price higher than the optimal unconstrained  
price. The higher price will ensure that demand is within the capacity  
constraint.  
This intuitive fact is formalized as follows\: Let *C* denote the capacity  
of the monopolist. The profit optimization problem for the monopolist  
is  
The Kuhn-Tucker necessary conditions for \(8.4\) imply that a nonnega-  
tive Lagrangian multiplier exists such that and satisfy 352 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
If then and the optimal price will be the same as  
the optimal unconstrained price. If the optimal capacity-  
constrained price will in general be higher than the unconstrained price.  
This is the same phenomenon we observed in Section 5.2.1.2‚ where the  
optimal constrained price is simply the maximum of the unconstrained  
optimal price and the stock-clearing price \(the price at which demand is  
exactly equal to capacity\).  
**8.3.3 Multiple-Price Monopoly and Price**  
# Discrimination  
While the monopolist can earn a positive profit by maximizing its  
selling price‚ it can earn even more profit by selling its product at mul-  
tiple prices. Many of these multiprice strategies have been offered as  
explanations of RM. Here we look at the variety of reasons a monopolist  
might want to use multiple prices‚ beginning with price discrimination.  
**8.3.3.1 Price Discrimination**  
*Price discrimination* is said to occur when two or more similar  
goods are sold at prices that are in different ratios to marginal costs  
\(Stigler \[489\]\). This definition‚ though somewhat technical‚ allows us to  
precisely compare prices of products that may differ in some respects;  
however‚ it also opens up ambiguities about when to consider two prod-  
ucts similar goods. Two hotel rooms for the same day and for the same  
length of stay may appear to be clearly identical. Yet if the time of  
purchase is considered an attribute of the products‚ then a hotel room  
sold two days in advance and one sold two months in advance may not  
be identical. \(See Phlips \[420\] for a discussion of many such examples.\)  
The essential question‚ however‚ is whether differences in price can be  
explained by differences in costs alone or by other factors‚ like attempts  
to extract consumer surplus.  
**Classification of Price Discrimination** Price discrimination can be  
classified into three types‚ depending on the degree of discriminating  
power \(this classification first given by Pigou \[421\]\)\:10  
*First-degree \(or perfect\) price discrimination* involves charging each  
customer the maximum amount he is willing to pay. To do so‚ the  
firm must have information on each customer’s willingness to pay  
and be able to vary price by customer and by unit. First-degree price  
10Though the definitions here are more modern and do not correspond exactly to Pigou’s  
original taxonomy. *The Economics of RM* 353  
discrimination is essentially a theoretical abstraction‚ as it is nearly  
impossible to elicit each customer’s individual reservation price‚ ex-  
cept in situations where the firm knows customers extremely well‚  
and even then‚ it may require a protracted negotiating process.  
*Second-degree price discrimination* occurs when the firm discrimi-  
nates by offering a menu of possible *purchase contracts* \(terms of  
trade\) and customers decide which contracts to purchase. Exam-  
ples include quantity discounts‚ two-part tariffs \(fixed plus variable  
fees\)‚ and bundle pricing. The key characteristic is that customers  
*self-select* the purchase contract that they like best.  
The advance-purchase and Saturday-stay restrictions of traditional  
airline RM can be considered a form of second-degree price discrimi-  
nation. The restrictions attempt to segment the customer population‚  
exploiting correlations between price sensitivity and product prefer-  
ences. They are designed so that customers self-select the product  
\(and pay the price\) targeted for their segment. Hotels follow a similar  
practice; they may set a weekly rate targeted at vacation guests and  
a daily rate targeted at business guests \(this is a form of nonlinear  
tariff\). Notice that self-selection is bound to be rather porous‚ in  
the sense that it is difficult to make sure that customers from one  
segment will not buy contracts targeted to other segments.  
*Third-degree price discrimination* occurs when the firm divides the  
customers into different groups based on some identifiable character-  
istics \(called a *sorting mechanism*\) and then sets a separate price for  
each group. It is assumed that the firm can identify‚ at the time  
of purchase‚ the characteristics that identify the segment of the cus-  
tomer. All the members of a group pay the same amount‚ but they  
are prohibited \(or are in someway discouraged\) from purchasing at  
the price set for other groups. Prices that differ by geographic re-  
gion‚ discounts for senior citizens‚ tour-group rates and conference  
rates offered by hotels and cruise-lines are some examples.  
In some industries like broadcasting and media‚ a combination of first-  
degree and second-degree price discrimination occurs when a bundle is  
priced individually based on the customer relationship‚ customer bud-  
gets‚ as well as the quantity purchased. Indeed‚ in practice the various  
forms of price discrimination are more commonly used in combination  
than in isolation.  
**Conditions for Price Discrimination** Several conditions are required  
to implement price discrimination\: 354 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
*Variance in customer preferences* If all customers are exactly identi-  
cal in terms of price sensitivity and nonprice preferences‚ there is little  
scope for price discrimination. Moreover‚ in the case of second-degree  
discrimination it must be possible to find self-selection mechanisms  
that are correlated with differences in willingness to pay‚ so it is in  
a customer’s interest to buy at the prices targeted for their group  
\(called *incentive-compatible mechanisms*\). In the case of third-degree  
price discrimination‚ the firm has to identify observable characteris-  
tics that are correlated with willingness to pay \(the *sorting mecha-*  
*nism*\).  
*No resale* To implement price discrimination‚ the product should also  
be either impossible to resell after purchase or contractually prohib-  
ited from resale‚ else arbitrage is possible. That is‚ someone \(or a  
firm\) could buy at the lower prices and resell the good to those cus-  
tomers who face higher prices‚ undercutting the firm’s ability to price  
discriminate. Such nontransferability is implemented in various ways  
in RM situations. Airlines and hotels prohibit transferability con-  
tractually and add high penalties on change of itinerary or dates. In  
industries such as broadcasting or energy‚ private contracts prohibit  
transferability. Personal services such as health care are also not  
transferable. Rules against scalping prevent resale in ticket markets.  
And so on.  
*Monopoly power* Firms should have some degree of monopoly power  
to sustain a structure of price discrimination. As we mentioned be-  
fore‚ under perfect competition in a commodity market‚ firms have  
no power to set prices‚ and the law of one price applies. Nevertheless‚  
the monopoly power need not be absolute‚ in the sense that there is  
a single seller without any threat of entry. When products are differ-  
entiated in some way or sold in dispersed markets‚ it is possible to  
maintain price discrimination even with limited market power‚ and  
a competitive equilibrium with multiple prices can still exist. The  
degree to which such discrimination can be practiced decreases as  
the number of competitors increases or the product differentiation  
decreases.  
**8.3.3.2 Optimal First- and Third-Degree Price**  
# Discrimination  
How does a monopolist price if it can price discriminate? We begin  
with the case of first- and third-degree price discrimination‚ which are  
the easiest to analyze. *The Economics of RM* 355  
**Graphical Analysis** Consider a simple linear-demand curve as shown  
in Figure 8.1. For simplicity, assume that marginal costs are zero. The  
shaded area in Figure 8.1\(i\) represents the maximum revenue obtained  
by selling at a single price, and denotes the revenue-maximizing price.  
Now consider what happens if the monopolist sells at multiple prices.  
To make the situation concrete, suppose three prices are offered,  
Further, suppose the monopolist can exercise *perfect price dis-*  
*crimination,* in the sense that those customers with reservation prices  
above buy at price those with reservation prices in the interval  
buy at and those with reservation prices in the interval  
buy at 11 Then the shaded area in Figure 8.1\(ii\) represents the rev-  
enue that is obtained.  
As is evident by comparing the shaded areas in Figure 8.1, the revenue  
that can be obtained by discriminating and selling at three prices is  
significantly greater than the revenue obtained by selling at a uniform  
price. And as is intuitively clear from the picture, the more prices used,  
the greater the revenue generated by the monopolist.  
Indeed, as the number of prices tends to infinity, we achieve first-  
degree price discrimination, since in the limit every customer will end  
11A monopolist who can implement this “perfect price discrimination” is also called the  
*Pacman monopolist* by von der Fehr and Kühn \[540\] because the monopolist “eats its way  
down” the demand curve with this pricing. 356 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
up paying exactly his reservation price for the product. The monopolist  
then captures the entire consumer surplus \(the entire area under the  
demand curve in Figure 8.1\).  
While this graphical argument is commonly used to explain price dis-  
crimination‚ it sidesteps the issue of how such a perfectly discriminating  
outcome might actually be achieved. One possibility is that the monop-  
olist offers the product for sale in high-to-low price order \(first then  
then and customers behave myopically‚ buying the first time  
the price drops below their reservation price.12 Another possibility is  
that there is some observable attribute \(such as height\) that is perfectly  
correlated with a customer’s reservation price and the monopolist price  
discriminates based on this observable attribute \(for example‚ taller peo-  
ple pay more\). As both examples suggest‚ however‚ such perfect price  
discrimination is a bit far-fetched in practice.  
**General Analysis** A more general \(and realistic\) case of third-degree  
price discrimination is to assume that there exists some sorting mech-  
anism that allows the monopolist to divide customer into segments.  
For simplicity‚ assume a constant marginal cost of For example‚ in the  
airline case we might have where the sorting is based on whether  
a customer is staying a Saturday night or not. Let be the demand  
function from segment when it is offered the price The aggregate  
demand function is then  
That is‚ if the uniform price is offered to all groups‚ the total demand  
from all groups is exactly the aggregate demand.  
The monopolist’s optimal prices are then obtained by solving  
As the problem is separable by groups‚ the optimal prices are simply  
determined by applying \(8.3\) to each group‚ yielding  
where is the marginal revenue of group  
Assuming the monopolist can prevent customers from switching to  
products not intended for him‚ then *any* sorting mechanism will result  
12See Chapter 5 for a discussion of this myopic-behavior assumption. *The Economics of RM* 357  
in \(weakly\) higher profits‚ since  
However‚ if there is no correlation between the segments and willingness  
to pay‚ then the discrimination will simply produce “copies” of the  
original demand function; for all where  
In this case‚ the inequality above is tight and there is no benefit from  
discrimination. If there are correlations between price sensitivity and  
segment \(that is‚ the demand elasticity varies from segment to segment\)‚  
there will be a strict benefit to discrimination.  
Of course‚ all this hinges on the ability of the monopolist to maintain  
the separation of segments. Indeed‚ if the separation breaks down‚ the  
monopolist may be worse off using price discrimination‚ as the following  
example illustrates\:  
**Example 8.5** Demand is given by as in Example 8.4. The marginal  
cost is  
*Optimistic monopolist* The monopolist believes it can perfectly segment customers  
and set two prices for the product and that all customers with valuations  
greater than or equal to will buy at and those with valuations between and  
will buy at Then its problem is  
One can verify that the optimal solution to this problem is to set and  
*Worst-case monopolist* The worst that can happen is that the sorting mechanism  
cannot be maintained and *all* customers buy at the lowest price. In this case‚ the  
monopolist’s profit from and is  
In short‚ the profit function and outcome are the same as those of the single-price  
monopolist. However‚ since the price is strictly less than the optimal single-price  
of this will result in lower profits. Hence‚ there is a danger that if the  
monopolist has optimistic beliefs about its ability to sort customers yet the sorting  
mechanism is easy to bypass‚ then price discrimination will generate lower profits  
than the single-price strategy.  
The issue of creating incentives for customer to “stay in their des-  
ignated segment” is the essence of second-degree price discrimination‚  
which we look at next.  
**8.3.3.3 Optimal Second-Degree Price Discrimination**  
Now suppose the monopolist cannot discriminate based on any ob-  
servable characteristics. In other words‚ customers reveal their “types”  
only through their purchase behavior‚ and they are not *ex ante* identifi- 358 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
able. In this case, the monopolist is forced to design a mechanism such  
that customers self-select the designated product.  
To make things simple, suppose the monopolist identifies a purchase  
condition—a contract—for which customers have a utility or disutility  
\(the Saturday stay\) that divides customers into groups of size  
Assume further that all customers in group have the same  
reservation price for contract denoted We assume for all  
that is, customers in group prefer contract Assume for simplicity  
the marginal cost is  
If the monopolist sets a price of for contract then a customer in  
group receives a utility from purchasing it. The customer will  
then self-select contract if it provides positive utility,  
and it has the highest utility among all contracts; that is‚ if  
Equation \(8.6\) is called the *participation constraint* because it ensures  
customers have nonnegative surplus from participating \(purchasing\).  
Equation \(8.7\) is called the *incentive compatibility* constraint and ensures  
that customers in group have an incentive to in fact select contract  
The monopolist then must solve the problem  
subject to satisfying \(8.6\) and \(8.7\) for all groups  
Note that if the monopolist could identify a customer’s group and  
charge them based on their identity \(third-degree discrimination\)‚ then it  
could eliminate constraint \(8.7\). In this case‚ it would charge each group  
a price just sufficient to satisfy the participation constraint \(8.6\)—  
namely‚ their maximum willingness to pay However‚ because  
of the need to induce customers to self-select and satisfy the incentive  
compatibility constraint \(8.7\)‚ the monopolist may be forced to charge  
some groups strictly less than their maximum willingness to pay  
The monopolist will therefore in general make less profit under second-  
degree price discrimination because of the need to create self-selection  
incentives. The following example illustrates this idea\:  
**Example 8.6** An airline offers an unrestricted full-price fare and a Saturday-stay  
discounted fare Business travelers want to return before the weekend and have a  
valuation for returning midweek and a value for staying over on  
Saturday. Leisure customers have no time preference and value both times at 100‚ so *The Economics of RM* 359  
their values are Suppose there is one business customer‚ two leisure  
customers‚ and no capacity constraints.  
If the airline could identify the business and leisure passengers and charge them  
accordingly \(third-degree discrimination\)‚ it would be optimal to charge the business  
customer \$700 for his desired flight and the two leisure customers \$100. However‚ if  
it cannot identify customers‚ then the airline must ensure that the business customer  
prefers the full-fare ticket. This will happen only if This  
constrains the monopolist’s price. In fact‚ an optimal set of prices to charge in this  
case is and This ensures that the business customer’s surplus  
from the full-fare is no less than his surplus from staying  
a Saturday night and buying the discounted fare‚  
Hence‚ we see the monopolist is forced to lower its full-price ticket by \$100 to induce  
self-selection.  
A multiprice policy need not be motivated by price discrimination  
alone. A monopolist might use multiple prices because of uncertainty in  
aggregate demand or because it fetches revenue with more consistency‚  
among other reasons‚ as we discuss next.  
**8.3.3.4 Capacity Constraints**  
Capacity constraints combined with aggregate uncertainty in demand  
can create an incentive to use multiple prices‚ as illustrated in the fol-  
lowing example\:  
**Example 8.7** \(Wilson \[568\]\) Suppose the capacity is 100 and there are two types of  
customers\: there are 50 customers who are willing to pay \$12 and an additional 100  
customers willing to pay only \$10. Customers arrive at random order \(with a pro-  
portional rationing\)‚ and there is no way to distinguish the high-valuation customers  
from the low-valuation ones.  
Charging a single price of \$12 fetches \$600‚ and charging a single price of \$10  
fetches \$1‚000. However‚ if the first 75 units are sold at \$10 and the remaining 25  
at \$12‚ then on average‚ one-third of the first 75 units \(or 25 units\) are sold to the  
high-valuation customers \(at less than the price they are willing to pay‚ \$10\)‚ and the  
remaining 50 units are sold to the low-valuation customers. The last 25 units will be  
sold only to the remaining high-valuation customers at \$12. So the expected revenue  
will be \$1‚050.13  
Example 8.7 works because total demand exceeds capacity‚ and there-  
fore multiple prices serve to efficiently ration capacity to high-value cus-  
tomers. The next case shows multiple prices will lead to more revenue  
even when total demand is no more than capacity.  
13The calculation‚ admittedly somewhat crude‚ goes like this. Of the first 75 seats‚ 25 are  
sold to the \$12 customers by proportional rationing. So 25 of the \$12 customers remain to  
buy the last 25. So the revenue is \$750 from the first 75 units and \$300 from the last 25  
units. 360 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**8.3.3.5 Precommitment and Demand Uncertainty**  
Just as in the Prescott equilibrium in the competitive case \(Sec-  
tion 8.2.3\)‚ the need to commit to prices combined with aggregate de-  
mand uncertainty create an incentive for a monopolist to use multiple  
prices. The following example illustrate this idea\:  
**Example 8.8** \(Dana \[142\]\) A monopolist must commit to both its capacity *C* and  
its prices prior to the realization of demand. The capacity cost is and the  
variable cost to serve is zero. Demand is high with a probability of 0.5 and low with  
probability 0.5. In the low-demand state‚ there are 50 customers with a reservation  
value of \$10; in the high-demand state‚ there are 100 customers with a reservation  
value of \$12.  
If the monopolist sets a single price of \$10‚ it is optimal to provide *C* = 100  
units of capacity‚ and the monopolist’s expected profit is \$750 – \$200 = \$550. If the  
monopolist sets a price of \$12‚ it is optimal to provide *C* = 50 units of capacity and  
the expected profit is \$600 – \$100 = \$500.  
However‚ by using multiple price and capacity controls‚ the monopolist can gener-  
ate more profit. Specifically‚ the monopolist could provide capacity of *C =* 100‚ sell  
the first 50 units at and sell the remaining 50 at a price of There-  
fore‚ if demand is low‚ its revenue will be \$500‚ and if demand is high‚ its revenue will  
be \$1‚100‚ giving an expected profit of \$800 – \$200 = \$600; hence‚ setting multiple  
prices and limiting sales at the lower price generate more revenue.  
Note that in this example the quantities supplied as the low and high  
price are exactly the Prescott quantities from Section 8.2.3; however‚ the  
prices are different. Namely‚ the Prescott prices \(8.1\) in this example  
are and The difference here is that the  
monopolist sets prices based on the maximum willingness to pay in each  
scenario rather than on the need to simply cover capacity costs‚ as is  
required in the zero-profit competitive equilibrium.  
**8.3.3.6 Risk Reduction**  
Even if there is no increase in expected revenue‚ a monopolist might  
still prefer a multiprice policy in the face of aggregate demand uncer-  
tainty because it lowers the *variance* of its revenue \(for example‚ the  
monopolist may be risk-averse\)‚ as shown by the following example\:  
**Example 8.9** Suppose that the firm has a resource with two units of capacity and  
there are three customers each demanding one unit. There is uncertainty in the  
valuations of the customers\: the firm knows only that the customer will buy with  
probability 1 if it prices at \$62.5 and with probability 0.5 if it prices at \$100.  
Then the best single-price policy can be verified to be \$100‚ with a total expected  
revenue of \$1‚100/8 \(the firm will sell zero units with a probability 1/8‚ exactly one  
unit with a probability 3/8 and two units with a probability 1/2\). A multiprice policy  
of selling the first seat at \$62.5 but the second at \$100 fetches the same expected  
revenue of \$1‚100/8 \(the firm will sell no units with a probability zero‚ exactly one  
unit at \$62.5 with a probability 1/4 and 2 units‚ one at \$62.5 and the other at \$100 *The Economics of RM* 361  
with a probability 3/4\). However‚ the variance of the revenue obtained is reduced  
from 4‚843.75 to 1‚875‚ as seen from the calculations in Table 8.3 for the single-price  
policy and in Table 8.4 for the multiple-price policy.  
In this example‚ the firm can cut its uncertainty in the number of  
units sold by selling the first few at a low price more consistently and  
then taking the risk of having unused capacity on only the final few  
high-priced units.  
**8.3.3.7 Fairness**  
An oft-forgotten consequence of selling at a fixed price is the inher-  
ent unfairness of the distribution of goods \(see Section 7.3.5 on models  
of rationing\). Customers who happen to arrive first get served with a  
higher probability‚ regardless of their valuations. A monopolist might be  
motivated to enforce fairness for the sake of long-run customer satisfac-  
tion. Multiple prices may be seen as one way to rectify this unevenness  
in allocation.  
**Example 8.10** Consider again a set of customers with private valuations for a  
single unit of a good. The firm has one unit for sale‚ and there are exactly two  
customers in the market who arrive sequentially‚ in period 1 and period 2 respectively.  
The firm knows only that the valuations are normally distributed with a mean of  
\$200 and standard deviation of \$30.  
The optimal single price for the firm can be verified to be equal to \$179.56 as  
follows. Let *F*\(200‚30\) be a normal distribution representing customer valuations 362 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
with mean 200 and standard deviation 30. For the single price case‚ we need to  
solve which yields The optimal  
single price of \$179.56 fetches a revenue of \$168.53. The first customer then gets the  
good with probability 0.752‚ and the second with probability 0.186‚ even though their  
valuations follow the same distribution.  
What if the monopolist wants both customers to have the same probability of  
obtaining the good? Let be the price charged in period 1 and for period  
2\. If we impose the restriction that customers have equal probabilities of getting  
the item‚ we need to solve subject to  
for a revenue of  
This yields \$172 and both the first and the second period customer will take home the good with  
a probability of 0.47.  
While the firm gives up some revenue as well as increases its risk of  
not selling the item‚ it decreasing the variance in customer surplus‚ and  
one can argue that this might have a long-term benefit to the firm. Con-  
ceivably other fairness criteria can also be used—equal *ex post* expected  
payments‚ equal expected surplus‚ are some possibilities.  
**8.3.3.8 Demand Learning**  
The price and demand in a given period provides information to the  
monopolist that it can potentially use to adjust the price in the sub-  
sequent period. This learning can lead to different prices in different  
periods as illustrated in the following two-period model\:  
**Example 8.11** \(Lazear \[332\]\) A firm has one unit of a good remaining and two  
periods in which to sell it. All customers have a uniform valuation unknown to the  
firm. The firm has a prior distribution of as uniform between 0 and 1.  
If the monopolist prices at a price in the first period and the unit does not  
sell, it knows that The firm’s posterior distribution of is then uniformly  
distributed between 0 and It can then use this updated information to set its  
price in the second period.  
Let be the prior c.d.f. in period 1 \(and p.d.f. and the posterior  
c.d.f. in period 2. Then the monopolist’s problem is to solve  
The optimality condition for \(8.8\) is  
which implies has to be greater than For the case of uniformly distributed‚  
The solution to \(8.8\) turns out to be  
**8.3.3.9 Changing Customer Valuations over Time**  
Finally‚ multiple prices could be used just because customer valuations  
change over time. A fashion good is not as fashionable after a while‚ *The Economics of RM* 363  
and customers might value it less. The following example illustrates this  
phenomenon\:  
**Example 8.12** \(Lazear \[332\]\) Customers value a good at during the first period,  
and at during the second The firm estimates the distribution of as  
uniform between 0 and 1. Then its pricing problem is  
Solving the optimality conditions result in optimal prices\:  
**8.3.3.10 The Effects of Discounting**  
We next illustrate the effect of discounting as discussed in Lazear \[332\].  
Consider the two-period learning model of Example 8.11. Let’s say the  
firm now has a discount rate \(a discount *factor* of so a  
sale at price in period 2 has a present value of Then its  
objective function changes from \(8.8\) to  
The optimal solution \(with a prior distribution of uted between 0 and 1\) changes to  
uniformly distrib-  
Note the difference between this and the solution to \(8.9\).  
The argument is that given *any* price in period 1‚ the firm should  
set the monopoly price in period 2‚ based on the posterior distribution.  
This would give for the uniform case. Now substitute this in  
\(8.10\)‚ and differentiate to get  
Notice that the policy in the second period does not change from  
Example 8.11. For large values of the firm prefers to sell in period 1  
than in period 2‚ so it prices lower than in Example 8.11 \(for example‚  
during the first period.  
**8.3.4 Strategic Customer Behavior**  
Customer are said to be *strategic* if they optimally adapt their be-  
havior in response to changes in a firm’s pricing policies or sales mech-  
anism. We have already considered strategic behavior in Section 5.5.2 364 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
in the context of price skimming‚ and in Chapter 6 in the context of  
strategic bidding in auctions. Here we reexamine the effect of strate-  
gic behavior—in particular‚ strategic purchase-timing behavior—on the  
optimal pricing decisions of a monopolist.  
**8.3.4.1 The Coase Problem Without Discounting**  
Questions concerning a monopolists’s ability to charge different prices  
over time were raised as far back as Coase \[124\]. The *Coase conjecture*14  
‚  
applied to a *durable good*15 with an infinite life‚ goes like this. Consider  
a monopolist selling a durable good with a constant marginal cost of  
production. As in our graphical example of third-degree price discrimi-  
nation in Section 8.3.3.2‚ a monopolist would ideally like to price its good  
high at first to sell to high-valuation customers. Once this high-value de-  
mand is exhausted \(the durable-goods assumption\)‚ the monopolist then  
lowers the price to sell to the remaining customers with lower valuations‚  
and so on. This results in a decreasing sequence of prices. However‚ ra-  
tional customers will anticipate the lower future prices and refuse to buy  
until the price drops to the minimum price‚ so the monopolist can sell  
only at the lowest price. Hence‚ the firm is forced to sell at a uniform  
price.  
Moreover‚ the monopolist may be forced to set its uniform price at  
marginal cost. This occurs‚ as in the price skimming model of Sec-  
tion 5.5.2‚ if the monopolist cannot credibly *commit* to its pricing strat-  
egy. Any fixed price higher than marginal cost is not subgame perfect  
because once the firm sells to the high-valuation customers‚ it is then  
optimal for it to subsequently lower the price \(provided the initial price  
is above the marginal cost\). Anticipating the firm’s temptation to lower  
prices‚ rational customers will not purchase at the initial high price.  
Pricing at marginal cost‚ therefore‚ is the only strategy that is subgame-  
perfect. This gives the Coase conjecture\: a durable-goods monopolist is  
forced to price at marginal cost‚ recovering the competitive outcome.  
As McAfee and Wiseman \[370\] point out‚ intuitively this result oc-  
curs because the monopolist is‚ in a sense‚ forced to “compete with  
itself in future periods; purchasing in the future is a perfect substi-  
14The Coase Conjecture‚ verified under certain conditions in the models of Stokey \[491\]‚  
Bulow \[93\]‚ and Gul‚ Sonnenschein‚ and Wilson \[228\] for high discount factors‚ is still referred  
to as a conjecture‚ and is distinct from the Coase theorem.  
15By *durable good‚* we mean here a good that does not need to be replaced in the foreseeable  
future‚ usually taken to be three years \(automobiles‚ major household appliances‚ personal  
computers‚ and so on\)‚ so that once customers buy‚ they do not need to buy again in sub-  
sequent periods. This is in contrast to nondurable goods \(groceries‚ gasoline‚ electricity\)‚  
which need to be purchased frequently over time. *The Economics of RM* 365  
tute for purchasing now \(assuming either arbitrarily fast price decreases  
or no discounting of utility over time‚ or both\). A qualitative recom-  
mendation that results from the Coase conjecture is that it is better  
for the monopolist to lease at a uniform price rather than sell outright  
because then a change in its lease price affects both current and future  
customers equally. The firm can then credibly commit to offering the  
optimal monopoly price. \(Wilson \[569\] offers this as an explanation for  
IBM’s traditional emphasis on leasing mainframe computers.\)  
While airline seats‚ retail fashion goods‚ and hotel rooms may seem  
the antithesis of a durable good‚ the differences are not as great as they  
appear at first blush. For one‚ a customer who purchases a unit of a  
perishable resource \(either a fashion item‚ an airline seat‚ or a hotel  
room\) is unlikely to buy another unit during the relevant life cycle \(sale  
period\) of the product‚ so the product effectively has an *infinite life* in  
this sense. There may be a limited number of potential customers as  
well‚ so as for the durable good‚ customers are exhausted over time. If  
the product is perishable and capacity is limited‚ most customers are  
aware that the RM monopolist has considerable difficulty committing  
to its price.16 Most important‚ the RM monopolist is asking the same  
questions as the durable-goods monopolist. A retailer may wonder if  
its markdown pricing policy will induce some high-valuation customers  
to delay their purchase until the markdowns occur. Similarly‚ an air-  
line or hotel manager might wonder if business customers are buying  
advance-purchase discounts‚ resulting in a dilution of revenue. For all  
these reasons‚ the durable-goods monopoly is a relevant model for un-  
derstanding RM practice.  
**8.3.4.2 The Coase Problem with Discounting**  
The above discussion ignores customers’ discount factors. We next  
describe the Coase problem and results with discounting. Our model  
and notation follow von der Fehr and Kühn \[540\].  
Assume that initially there is a group of customers who are willing  
to buy during the subsequent periods but that customers \(the buyers‚  
*B*\) discount their valuations by a rate and the firm \(the seller‚  
*S*\) discounts its revenues at a rate of Let and  
be the corresponding discount factors. The monopolist  
sells to a set of customers who demand exactly one unit of the good‚  
which has a marginal cost of zero to produce. can either be finite  
16A good industry example of this behavior is seen in the cruise-line industry‚ where last  
minute discounts are pervasive. As a result‚ most industry insiders feel customers are now  
“trained” to wait until the last minute to purchase. 366 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
or a continuum Customers’ valuations  
are given by and we assume that the customers are  
indexed by nondecreasing valuations. The utility for a customer with  
value who purchases in period at price is given by The  
firm can choose its prices from a set *P‚* which can be either a discrete  
price grid or a continuum The number of periods *T* can be either  
finite or infinite.  
The firm sets a price in period based on past history. Given a  
price in period and the history of all prices up until time customers  
decide whether to purchase or wait for the next period. The firm can  
potentially condition its strategy based on the purchase behavior of each  
single customer. Both customers and the firm are assumed to be risk-  
neutral utility maximizers. The following result then holds\:  
THEOREM 8.1 *\(\[26\]; proof in \[540\]\) If then for every is finite and the price-set*  
*there exists a such that for all*  
*the unique subgame-perfect equilibrium in prices is perfectly*  
*discriminating.*  
Note that this is solely an existence result. Essentially‚ Theorem 8.1  
says that if the firm is sufficiently patient‚ it will \(credibly\) threaten to  
wait as long as it takes for the high-valuation customer to buy. Only  
then will it lower the price. Since there is a finite number of customers‚  
each customer has a significant impact on the firm’s profit‚ again making  
the threat credible. Customers faced with a firm like this are better off  
purchasing immediately as soon as the price drops below their valuations;  
that is‚ it is optimal for customer to behave *myopically.* Although the  
number of periods can be infinite‚ this is not strictly necessary‚ provided  
the firm can condition prices on which customers purchased so far‚ as  
the following example from Bagnoli et al. \[26\] shows\:  
**Example 8.13** The market has two customers with reservation values and  
there are two periods of sale. Assume Assume also that customers  
purchase at any price that gives them a nonnegative utility \(as opposed to the utility  
maximizers of Theorem 8.1\). In period 2‚ both customers are better off buying if the  
price is below their valuations. The firm knowing this sets if customer  
1 has not yet purchased the good‚ and if customer 1 already purchased in  
period 1. \(Note that this policy requires the firm to know who bought in the first  
period.\) Given that the second stage is played this way‚ we can verify that the firm  
obtains the maximum payoff by setting \(by calculating the payoff for the two  
options and The firm will discriminate perfectly‚ and its discounted payoff is  
then  
For the next result, assume that and let the marginal cost  
be a real number but not an integer. \(This is an odd—yet not that *The Economics of RM* 367  
restrictive—assumption‚ but if *c* is integer‚ von der Fehr and Kühn \[540\]  
show that multiple equilibria can exist.\) *P* is a set of uniformly spaced  
grid of prices‚ We then have  
THEOREM 8.2 *\(\[228\], \[21\]; proof in \[540\]\) There exists a*  
*such that for all and all there exists a unique*  
*subgame-perfect equilibrium with the Coase property; that is, is the*  
*competitive price and all customers with valuations greater than*  
*buy in the first period.*  
For this result to hold two conditions are important. First‚ there is a  
continuum of customers‚ so no customer by himself is important enough  
to the firm‚ and therefore the firm’s threat not to reduce prices until a  
measure of high-value customers buys ceases to be credible. Second‚ the  
firm can cut the price only in discrete amounts \(here by 1‚ but more gen-  
erally by an amount as in \[540\]\)‚ so if the customers’ discount factor  
is sufficiently close to 1‚ they can wait for a price cut. \(If prices are con-  
tinuous‚ no matter how patient the customers‚ the firm can cut in small  
enough increments to force the customers to purchase immediately.\)  
While the opposing conclusions of Theorems 8.1 and 8.2 might appear  
confusing at first‚ the important point is the dependence of the results on  
the relevant factors‚ such as the number of customers‚ the relative value  
of the discount factors‚ the firm’s knowledge of customer valuations‚ and  
the information the firm gains after each sale about who bought and who  
didn’t.  
These relationships provide insights into RM. For one‚ they suggest  
a firm’s ability to discriminate intertemporally depends on who is more  
patient‚ the firm or the customer. If the firm is patient‚ it can credibly  
sustain price discrimination; conversely‚ if consumers are patient‚ it can-  
not. This is key issue when selling a perishable product; if customers  
know that the good is perishable or has a fixed deadline for sale‚ they  
know that the discount factor for the firm is low. On the other hand‚  
customers are aware that there is a fixed capacity‚ and there is a chance  
that demand will exceed capacity and they will be rationed out of the  
market. The longer customers wait‚ the smaller their chances of getting  
the good‚ so their discount factor is also low \(unless of course they know  
that demand is certain to be below capacity\). However‚ it is likely that  
only the firm knows the information about aggregate demand \(say from  
the historical demand\). This suggests it is strategically important for the  
firm not to reveal information on its demand state—such as remaining  
capacity‚ historical demand‚ or current rate of sale. For their part‚ cus-  
tomers have an incentive to conceal information about their valuations‚  
even *ex post‚* because otherwise the firm can identify who purchased and 368 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
who did not and change its pricing based on the history of valuations.  
This latter point serves as something of theoretical justification for the  
often wary public reaction to the concept of *personalized pricing.* \(See  
Johnson \[269\].\)  
Finally‚ we have also assumed that all customers *want* to purchase the  
items at time zero and discount their valuations in each subsequent pe-  
riod. For the monopolist‚ this leads at best to a price-skimming policy or  
at worst to a constant-price policy. A more general assumption would be  
that customers’ desired purchase times are randomly distributed during  
the horizon and that they discount both having to buy earlier or later  
than they would like.  
**8.3.4.3 Quasi-Myopic Behavior**  
Somewhat in between the myopic- and strategic-customer model is a  
model where the firm sets its prices so that it is in the best interests  
of the strategic customer to *be* myopic \(myopic behavior is incentive-  
compatible\). This‚ of course‚ gives the firm more leeway and leads to a  
revenue that‚ while not as good as the perfect-discrimination price‚ is not  
as bad as the Coasian prediction. One such model is found in Harris and  
Raviv \[239\]‚ which we describe as given in Wilson \[569\] \(pp.242–244\).  
**Example 8.14** \(MYOPIC INCENTIVE CONSTRAINED PRICING\) A monopolist faces *N*  
potential customers whose valuations are distributed over the discrete set of values  
with a known, discrete distribution. Each customer demands  
one unit of the product. The firm has an inventory of *C* units and assume *N \> C.*  
The firm sets a declining price schedule with price valid in  
period The probability of the inventory is still available in period is given by  
It is assumed that the customer is able to calculate this number. A customer with a  
valuation that is planning on purchasing in period will have an expected  
surplus of Period is targeted at the customer with valuation The  
firm sets the prices such that each customer is indifferent between purchasing at the  
intended time or delaying to a later period. That is, the prices satisfy the indifference  
constraint  
This recursive constraint‚ in fact‚ determines the prices set by the monopolist\:  
The monopolist’s decision is essentially to determine the lowest-valuation customer  
that it is willing to sell to. \(Note that only the lowest-valuation customers that can  
buy are left with zero surplus.\) *The Economics of RM* 369  
**8.3.5 Optimal Mechanism Design for a**  
# Monopolist  
Thus far we have assumed that the selling mechanism of the monopo-  
list is given. But what if the monopolist has the freedom to chose among  
all possible mechanisms? Which is the optimal one to use?  
In a sense, this question was answered in Section 6.2.5 on optimal  
auctions. There we saw that under the assumptions of the private-value  
auction model, a first- or second-price auction with an appropriately  
chosen reserve price is optimal among all possible selling mechanisms,  
including simple posted prices, price discrimination, and dynamic pric-  
ing. \(See the discussion in Section 6.2.6.\) Here we consider a variation  
of this same optimal-mechanism design result, due to Harris and Ra-  
viv \[239\], in which customers take on a discrete number of types. \(This  
contrasts with the private-value auction model, in which customers take  
on a continuum of types.\) We show that an alternative pricing mecha-  
nism is optimal in this case, though it is closely related to an auction  
mechanism and is essentially a variation of the optimal auction results.  
There are *N* potential customers indexed by and the firm has a finite  
capacity *C.* The firm and all customers are risk-neutral. The marginal  
cost of serving a customer is zero. Customer is willing to pay an amount  
to acquire the product. Customers’ valuations are private information,  
and the firm and customers other than know only that the distribution  
of is equally likely to be one of values \(So  
the situation is one of asymmetric information.\) For simplicity, assume  
the values are on an equally spaced grid so that  
where and are given constants. Customers’ valuations are  
independent draws from this discrete distribution. Let  
with denoting as usual the vector without the component.  
As in the optimal auction analysis of Section 6.2.3‚ the monopolist’s  
problem can be reduced to a search for an optimal direct-revelation  
mechanism‚ in which the customers truthfully reveal their valuations and  
the monopolist’s problem is to find only the optimal direct-revelation  
mechanism. Formally‚ a direct-revelation mechanism is defined by an  
allocation rule \(a collection of functions that describe the num-  
ber of units allocated to each customer as a function  
of the values **v**\) and a payment rule \(another collection of functions  
that describe what each customer is required to pay  
in return for his allocation\). Customers are asked to report their values 370 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**v**‚ and then they receive their allocation and make payments according  
to the announced allocation and payment functions. One can show it is  
sufficient to consider only symmetric allocation and payment rules‚ in  
which case the allocation to customer is only a function of his value  
and the values of the other customers. That is‚  
and for all So in what follows‚ we consider only  
symmetric mechanisms.  
For the mechanism to be a direct-revelation mechanism‚ each cus-  
tomer should have an incentive to report his true value rather than  
some other value This is enforced by the following incentive compat-  
ibility constraint\:  
where *S*\(*·*\) is a customer’s expected surplus‚ given by  
where good and denotes the probability of obtaining the  
denotes the expected payment of  
customer  
Harris and Raviv \[239\] analyze this problem and show that‚ as in  
the optimal-auction problem‚ the above optimization problem can be  
reduced to a function of the allocation variables alone; namely‚  
where  
The function is analogous to the virtual value we saw in Chapter 6;  
note that it is strictly less than the customer’s value because‚ as in an  
auction‚ customers retain some “information rents” due to the asymme-  
try of information. Like the virtual value in the auction‚ also has  
the interpretation as the monopolist’s marginal-revenue function. To see  
why‚ let denote the expected demand at price and observe that *The Economics of RM* 371  
\(increasing price decreases demand\). The expected revenue  
at price is then  
Therefore‚ the marginal revenue obtained by increasing demand from  
to is  
And again as in the auction-design problem‚ the optimal allocation  
above is straightforward to implement\: rank the customers  
by their virtual values and allocate the items to those customers  
with the highest virtual values stopping when either all *C* units  
are exhausted or the virtual value of the customers drops below zero.  
Harris and Raviv show that the following *priority-pricing* scheme  
achieves this optimal allocation\: the firm announces a schedule of prices  
and each customer self-selects the price he is willing  
to pay. However‚ customers selecting higher prices have higher priority  
because the firm allocates items to customers in order from highest to  
lowest price. Formally‚ let be a cut-off index defined such that  
Then we have the following result\:  
THEOREM 8.3 *\(\[239\]\) \(i\) If C \< N‚ the optimal scheme is a priority-*  
*pricing scheme with priority prices is defined by \(8.12\)\)*  
*given by*  
*where under the optimal allocation\:*  
*is the probability of purchase for a customer with valuation*  
*\(ii\) If equal to the optimal marketing scheme is to set a single price*  
*where again‚ is as given by \(8.12\). This is the smallest* 372 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
*reservation value such that the marginal expected value is greater than*  
*or equal to zero \(the marginal cost\).*  
One can interpret Theorem 8.3 in terms of our earlier optimal auction  
results of Chapter 6 as follows. The priority price is equivalent to  
the optimal bid that a customer of type would make in a first-price  
auction‚ and is equivalent to the optimal reserve price. And as in  
a first-price auction‚ customers are sorted and awarded units according  
to their bid values. Here‚ because types are discrete‚ the firm can pre-  
compute the optimal bids and offer them as posted priority prices.17  
Customers will pick the priority price that corresponds to their optimal  
first-price bid. In this sense‚ the priority pricing mechanism is essentially  
equivalent to an optimal first-price auction mechanism.  
**8.3.6 Advance Purchases and Peak-Load Pricing**  
# Under Monopoly  
As mentioned in Sections 8.2.7 and 8.2.4‚ advance-purchase markets  
and peak-load pricing are common features of many quantity-based  
RM industries. Here we look at the monopoly analysis of Gale and  
Holmes \[196\] of these two phenomena‚ who use mechanism design tech-  
niques to show that advance-purchase discounts achieve the revenue of  
the best possible sale mechanism \(and is superior to peak-load pricing\).  
We present their explanation in terms of an airline example‚ although  
similar reasoning can be given for other industries where identical \(sub-  
stitutable\) inventory is sold for use in different periods.  
The model is similar in spirit to the one discussed in Section 8.2.6.  
Consider a monopoly that has two flights for a future day of departure‚  
one flight departing at a time of high demand and the other at a time  
of low demand. The capacity of each flight is *C.* The total number of  
customers *N* exceeds *C* but is less than 2*C‚* The time before departure  
is divided into two periods‚ an early period \(call it period 1\) and a  
late period nearer the time of departure \(call it period 2\). We assume  
that there is a continuum of customers and that the capacity and the  
population size are normalized so that the total population size is one  
\(*N* = 1\). All the customers are identical and have a reservation price of  
The customer purchase model is essentially identical to that of Sec-  
tion 8.2.6; during period 1‚ customers are uncertain which one of the  
flight times they prefer. They will realize this only during period 2.  
17Indeed‚ note the similarity between the formula for the optimal price optimal bidding strategy \(6.4\) of Section 6.2.2.2 for the first-price auction.  
above and the *The Economics of RM* 373  
However, throughout they know their private waiting cost \(even dur-  
ing period 1\) for taking their less preferred flight. The waiting cost  
varies from individual to individual and \(from the perspective of the  
firm\) is an i.i.d. random draw from a distribution with density  
over A customer then, is willing to pay for his less  
preferred flight. Of the total number of customers, a fraction  
will realize in period 2 that they prefer the first flight. So there is con-  
gestion on this flight, but there is enough capacity to satisfy all potential  
demand on the second flight—that is, The monopolist is  
aware that the first of the two flights is going to be the peak-demand  
flight.  
The monopolist would like to design a mechanism that maximizes its  
profits. However, since the customers’ cost information is private, the  
mechanism should be such that it is in the customers’ best interests to  
truthfully reveal their costs.  
There are a number of different pricing options\: using a single-price  
for both flights, a peak price for the first flight and a lower price for the  
second flight, or an advance-purchase discount \(APD\) in period 1. In  
fact, there are an infinite number of possible sales mechanisms. Although  
one could use the theory of mechanism design to find the best among all  
possible forms of pricing policies, here we focus on comparing peak-load  
pricing with advance-purchase discounts.  
In peak-load pricing the peak flight is sold at a price of and  
the off-peak flight at a lower price of \(A single-price policy will  
lead to equal or lower revenue than a peak-load pricing policy as the  
monopolist has the option of setting  
Let be the unique solution satisfying  
Then at a price of for flight 1 and for flight 2‚ the monopolist  
is assured of filling flight 1. Indeed‚ it is not hard to show that  
\(a price of for flight 1\) is always optimal and that it is optimal to have  
So the optimal maximizes the total revenue  
defined by  
The first-order conditions imply  
and is the solution to this equation. 374 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
If‚ instead‚ the monopolist prices both flights at a cost of during  
period 1 and offers an advance-purchase discount of during period 1  
for the low-demand flight‚ any customer with a time cost below will  
find it beneficial to buy the low-demand flight early; if he waits‚ he has  
to pay but if he buys in advance‚ he has to pay only \(with  
a probability that it won’t be his desired flight and he will incur an  
expected time cost of So it is incentive compatible for the customer  
to follow the monopolist’s plan.  
The monopolist will set to maximize its profit function under the  
advance-purchase discount scheme which is given by‚  
Differentiating we get as the solution to  
We assume is increasing in so this solution is uniquely  
defined.18 Comparing \(8.15\) with \(8.13\)‚ as shown in Ap-  
pendix 8.A‚ the revenue from giving advance-purchase discounts exceeds  
that from peak-load pricing—that is‚  
The intuition behind this result is that in a peak-load pricing scheme‚  
the monopolist has to give a discount to *all* customers who fly on the low-  
demand flight—even those customers with high valuations who prefer  
the low-demand flight. In contrast‚ the advance-purchase mechanism—  
because it is a self-selection mechanism—gives discounts only to cus-  
tomers with low waiting costs.  
Note also that the discounts are offered in period 1‚ before customers  
know their preferences. This uncertainty plays a role\: the monopolist  
can offer a discount of instead of in the earlier period‚ because  
there is some chance customers will end up on their preferred flight. The  
lower discount that results makes this a profitable policy. This advan-  
tage of advance-purchase selling is reiterated by Shugan and Xie \[467\]‚  
who note that in the advance-purchase market a firm sells to customers  
who are uncertain about their time preferences‚ and this puts the firm in  
a better position during the consumption period when customers \(pri-  
vately\) know their time preferences. In this sense‚ the information asym-  
18This assumption is equivalent to the familiar monotone marginal-revenue assumption‚ As-  
sumption 7.2‚ but expressed in terms of distribution of the waiting cost rather than in  
terms of the distribution of the utility *The Economics of RM* 375  
metry between customers and the firm is lower in the advance-purchase  
market‚ which benefits the firm.  
From a social-welfare point of view also‚ the advance-purchase dis-  
count mechanism turns out to be superior‚ as the overall sum of cus-  
tomer and firm surplus is maximized. Those with high costs for taking  
the less desirable flight do not take it‚ and those with lower costs take  
the low-demand flight. Here‚ advance-purchase restrictions serve as the  
optimal mechanism for allocating resources‚ while being compatible with  
customers’ interests in revealing their private information.  
**8.4 Price and Capacity Competition in an**  
# Oligopoly  
An oligopoly is a market in which a limited number of firms compete  
to supply the same \(or similar\) good. As in a monopoly‚ individual firms  
are sufficiently large so that their actions \(prices and quantities\) affect  
market demand. Yet‚ firms do not operate in isolation as in a monopoly‚  
and the actions of one firm affect the demand of its competitors as well.  
This creates a strategic interaction among the firms’ decisions‚ which  
is the distinguishing feature of oligopolistic competition. Oligopoly is  
arguably the most interesting market condition for studying RM because  
it is the prevailing competitive situation in many RM industries.  
The two classic models of oligopoly are the Cournot model \(com-  
petition in quantities \[132\]\) and the Bertrand model \(competition in  
prices \[54\]\). The standard equilibrium concept for an oligopoly is the  
\(pure-strategy\) Nash equilibrium. \(See Appendix F for basic definitions  
and concepts related to Nash equilibria.\) The equilibria need not be  
unique.  
The goal of oligopoly analysis is to derive Nash equilibria‚ analyze  
their properties‚ and study the resulting implications for individual firms  
and the market as a whole. When multiple Nash equilibria exist‚ the pre-  
dictive power of the model is diminished because it is not clear which of  
the multiple equilibria will emerge in an industry.19 Therefore‚ prov-  
ing there is a unique equilibrium—if this is the case—is important.  
Sometimes‚ no pure-strategy equilibrium exists at all. In such cases‚  
a *mixed-strategy equilibrium* may exist‚ in which firms randomize over  
their strategies‚ though such equilibria typically give less insight into  
market outcomes.  
19 Ways to predict the “most-likely” equilibria when multiple equilibria exist is an active topic  
of research in game theory. See Samulson \[453\]. 376 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
We begin by looking at static \(one-shot\) oligopoly models where firms  
sell a homogeneous product. We then look at dynamic models with  
repeated interactions between firms. Finally‚ we consider models where  
firms sell differentiated products.  
**8.4.1 Static Models**  
Static models of oligopoly are one-stage models of competition in  
which firms make their decisions simultaneously. We look first at compe-  
tition in quantities \(Cournot competition\) then at competition in prices  
\(Bertrand competition\).  
Do firms practicing RM compete on price or quantity? It’s difficult  
to say. On the one hand‚ as capacity is fixed in many RM contexts‚ this  
would suggest that price is the relevant strategic variable. So Bertrand  
competition might seem more appropriate. On the other hand‚ the main  
decision variables in quantity-based RM are capacity allocations‚ which  
are quantity variables. This would seem to imply that Cournot models  
are more relevant for quantity-based RM. Yet‚ neither the Bertrand  
nor the Cournot model is completely adequate for describing quantity-  
based RM. In Section 8.4.3‚ we model dynamic RM interactions in price  
and allocations in a duopoly \(two-firm\) market‚ which comes closer to  
fully describing RM competition. Still‚ for broad questions on long-term  
market behavior‚ strategic-capacity investment‚ and price competition‚  
Cournot and Bertrand models are relevant to RM.  
**8.4.1.1 Static Cournot Model**  
Cournot’s paper \[132\] is one of the earliest models of oligopolistic  
competition. He studied a market of firms that choose their production  
quantity simultaneously. The market then determines the price that  
clears total output.  
Let denote the output of the firms‚ and  
denote the aggregate supply. The price at which the market  
clears the supply *X* is given by an inverse-demand function Note  
that the exact mechanism by which this supply is sold is unspecified  
in the model‚ though one can imagine a fictional auctioneer who sells  
the total supply by searching for a price that exactly clears the market.  
\(Indeed‚ the absence of a realistic price-setting mechanism is a persistent  
criticism of the Cournot model.\) Nevertheless‚ the model captures many  
important aspects of strategic interaction and as a result has become a  
mainstay of the industrial organization literature. *The Economics of RM* 377  
For simplicity we assume a constant marginal cost *c* for each firm.  
Then firm maximizes its profit  
This leads to the first-order condition \(called the *Cournot pricing for-*  
*mula*\)\:  
The Cournot equilibrium is given by the simultaneous solution of these  
first-order conditions‚ and it exists under quite general conditions.  
For instance‚ a sufficient condition is that the profit function *V*\(·\) be  
quasiconcave in and the strategy spaces compact. The *markup* of  
firm *i* is given by if The size of the  
markup indicates the degree of market power that firms have.  
Let denote the market share of firm and  
denote the market-demand elasticity \(with respect to  
quantity\) at *X.* Rewriting the Cournot pricing formula in terms of  
these quantities‚  
Thus‚ a firm’s markup is directly proportional to its market share and  
is lower if the demand elasticity is higher. All firms that produce make  
positive profits. However‚ if all the firms have the same marginal costs‚  
as the number of firms increases‚ Cournot profits approach zero; equiva-  
lently‚ the equilibrium approaches that of perfect competition. We illus-  
trate this outcome for the case of linear demand and constant marginal  
costs in the following example\:  
**Example 8.15** \(COURNOT WITH LINEAR-DEMAND FUNCTIONS\) Consider a market  
with function firms with a constant marginal cost of production and linear inverse-demand  
So firm payoff function is  
Differentiating \(8.17\) with respect to and setting it to 0 yields  
The symmetric equilibrium is given by 378 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and the market-clearing price at the Cournot equilibrium by  
So the equilibrium price is strictly above marginal cost‚ but as the  
competitive price.  
For general \(nonquasiconcave\) payoff functions‚ an equilibrium need  
not exist.  
**8.4.1.2 Cournot with Uncertain Demand and Exogenous**  
# Price  
We next look at a variation of the Cournot model with demand un-  
certainty that more closely matches quantity-based RM situations. It is  
the oligopoly analogue of the well-known *newsvendor problem* in opera-  
tion management‚ and one can think of it as a stylized model of firms  
competing in capacity allocations under demand uncertainty.  
Consider first the following monopoly newsvendor model. A firm faces  
a stochastic demand *D* for its good and must produce before observing  
the value of *D. D* is a continuous random variable with known distri-  
bution *F*\(·\). There is a variable cost for producing units‚ and each  
unit sells at a fixed price The newsvendor problem is a good model  
for situations where prices are exogenous‚ and capacity decisions have  
to be made *ex ante* and cannot be changed after observing high or low  
demand states.  
The \(monopolist\) newsvendor problem is to order a quantity to  
maximize the firm’s expected profits \(assuming salvage value of 0\)  
This is a well studied problem \(see Winston \[571\]‚ pp.907–909\) and serves  
as the basic template for the overbooking problems of Chapter 4. From  
the first-order conditions for \(8.21\)‚ one can show that the optimal out-  
put quantity satisfies  
This result is analogous to Littlewood’s rule \(2.2\) from Chapter 2.  
The oligopoly version of the newsvendor problem can be considered  
as Cournot competition with uncertain demand and an exogenously de-  
termined price. The exogenous price can be thought of being set com-  
petitively at a aggregate level‚ while capacity allocations take place at  
a lower‚ operational level \(for example‚ airlines matching fares in broad  
O-D markets but tactically competing in terms of allocating capacity on  
individual flight departures\). *The Economics of RM* 379  
Each firm chooses a quantity before demand is realized. Customers  
choose among the available firms‚ and if a firm is out of stock‚ customers  
may switch and purchase from a competing firm. \(Customers are willing  
to substitute among firms.\) Hence‚ the demand that firm sees depends  
on the quantity decisions of its competitors‚ Specifically‚ firm  
payoff function is given by  
where is the *effective demand* function \(a random variable\)  
for that is a function of *D* and the quantities **x**‚ supplied by all firms.  
Because price is not guaranteed to adjust to the supply‚ as in the Cournot  
model‚ there is a possibility of the market supplying too much or too  
little capacity for a given demand realization.  
The effective demand may be defined by various reallocation rules or  
through discrete-choice models of customer behavior. \(See Lippman and  
McCardle \[346\] and Mahajan and van Ryzin \[355\].\) The only assump-  
tions required‚ however‚ are \(1\) that the effective demand for firm is  
stochastically decreasing in that is‚ the more capacity its competi-  
tors provide‚ the lower the demand seen by firm and \(2\) the distribu-  
tion of the effective demand is continuous on a bounded interval  
for all  
quantity The payoff function \(8.22\) for each firm is concave in the firm’s own  
Hence‚ by a standard result in game theory for games with  
quasiconcave payoff functions \(see Appendix F\)‚ it follows  
THEOREM 8.4 *\(\[346\]\) There exists a pure-strategy equilibrium in in-*  
*in the n-firm competitive newsvendor*  
*ventory levels game.*  
A quantity of interest is the total capacity provided by the firms and  
how it compares with that of the monopoly case. Consider for illustra-  
tion purposes the following duopoly setting\:  
**Example 8.16** Consider a duopoly newsvendor competition‚ and let denote the  
“native demand” for firm That is‚ these are the customers whose first preference  
is for firm However‚ customers will buy from the competing firm if their preferred  
firm has no remaining capacity. The effective demand for firms 1 and 2 is then given  
by  
where are the capacities of the two firms. The aggregate demand is  
and it is assumed to have a continuous‚ strictly increasing c.d.f. *F*\(·\)*.*  
Each firm has a variable cost for its capacity.  
Recall that for the monopoly case‚ the optimal quantity The equilibrium duopoly quantities‚ is determined by  
in contrast‚ 380 satisfy  
*THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Now suppose monopoly capacity. Then  
that is‚ the total equilibrium capacity is less than the  
a contradiction. So we must have therefore at least as large as the monopoly capacity.  
the total duopoly capacity is  
This example suggests that if firms compete in allocations‚ they will  
tend to use allocations that are higher than the monopoly allocations.  
Lippman and McCardle \[346\] show that this result holds in general  
for certain reallocation rules‚ and Mahajan and van Ryzin \[355\] show  
that it holds when customers choose sequentially according to a general  
discrete-choice model. However‚ Netessine and Rudi \[405\] provide ex-  
amples where competitive quantities can be lower than the monopoly  
quantities‚ at least for one of the firms.  
An interesting case in point is when “competing goods” are in fact  
really substitute goods offered by the same firm. For example‚ they  
could represent different departure times offered by the same airline. The  
model here suggests that if firms are not aware of customer substitution  
behavior‚ they may in effect be “competing with themselves” in setting  
allocations for their substitute goods. This can lead to distortions in  
the capacity allocations and lower profits compared with the case where  
allocations are coordinated.  
**8.4.1.3 RM Duopoly Games**  
Consider the case of a duopoly in which both firms have a fixed capac-  
ity but sell in two classes‚ denoted *H* \(high\) and *L* \(low\). Each firm offers  
identical prices Customers substitute among airlines within  
the same class‚ and the strategic decisions are how much of the capacity  
to allocate to class *L.* This problem has been studied by Netessine and  
Shumsky \[404\]‚ and we review their model here.  
Demand for each firm and class is modeled as random variables for  
and with demand reallocation occurring as follows.  
If class *H* is closed for firm 1‚ all residual *H* demand for 1 goes to class  
*H* of firm 2 and vice versa. Similarly‚ if class *L* is closed for firm 1‚ all  
residual *L* demand for firm 1 goes to class *L* of firm 2 and vice versa.  
Note there is no buy-up; a *L* customer is assumed to never purchase a *The Economics of RM* 381  
*H* fare, and a *H* customer never purchases a *L* fare. We also assume  
that all *L* demand appears before *H* demand. This corresponds to a  
duopoly version of the independent-class assumption of Chapter 2 and  
Appendix E.  
We next argue that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium should exist for  
this game, using a bipartite graph framework and Littlewood’s rule \(Sec-  
tion 2.2.1\). Let the strategy space for firm 1 be the high-fare protection  
level, over the set of integers between \[0, *C*\], and for firm 2, let its  
strategy space be defined over \[0, *C*\]*,* where is firm 2’s high-fare  
protection level.  
By Littlewood’s rule, the optimal protection level for *H* is independent  
of the demand from *L* customers. As *L* demand does not buy up, this  
two-class RM game can be defined in terms of the protection levels for  
*H* demand only.  
Form a bipartite graph with *C* nodes on one side representing firm  
1’s strategy and *C* nodes on the other side, with node representing  
firm 2’s strategy of protecting units \(Figure 8.2\). Call this the  
*equilibrium graph.* Arc represents firm 1’s best response \(order  
units\) if firm 2 protects units. The following proposition is proved  
in Appendix 8.A\:  
PROPOSITION 8.1 *Let and Then the equilibrium graph*  
*for the duopoly RM game cannot have the two best-response arcs for firm*  
*1 of the form and Similarly for firm 2.*  
If the graph has no crossing arcs, as in Proposition 8.1, then there  
has to exist an equilibrium pair of arcs, as seen by simply following  
a sequence of best-response arcs\: we either have an equilibrium pair  
of arcs, or we have to double back and create a crossing pair of arcs  
\(Talluri \[503\]\). Thus, the game has an equilibrium.  
Littlewood’s rule assumes that the demands for the two classes are not  
correlated. However what if demand is correlated across the two firms  
\(but still without buy-up from *L* to *H*\)? That is, the *L* demand for  
firm 1 is correlated with the *L* demand for firm 2, and similarly, the *H*  
demand. Notice that in this case, each firm will still set its best-response  
using Littlewood’s rule\: For a fixed protection level of the other firm,  
the *L* and *H* demand each firm sees is uncorrelated. So with this type of  
correlation in demand, the protection level set for *B* is still independent  
of the demand forecast of *L*, and by the above argument there is still a  
guaranteed equilibrium.  
Netessine and Shumsky \[404\] analyze this game for the more com-  
plicated case where there is a correlation between the *L* demand and  
*H* demand, and also for the case of “vertical competition” with two 382 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
airlines serving different markets and operating connecting itineraries.  
For the case of correlation between *L* and *H* demand‚ they show that  
an equilibrium need not always exist. The best response functions for  
their example without an equilibrium \(under their continuous model\)  
are shown in Figure 8.3.  
The correlations between the *L* and *H* demands can cause a firm’s  
objective function \(say firm 1\) to be multimodal \(for a fixed allocation  
of the other airline\). As the other firm increases its booking limit for  
the lower class‚ the optimal solution for firm 1 can jump from one of the  
peaks of the multimodal function to another peak‚ causing the jump seen  
in Figure 8.3. In addition‚ one of the main results of \[404\] are conditions  
on the correlation matrix for existence of pure-strategy equilibrium.  
**8.4.1.4 Static Bertrand Models**  
The second fundamental model of oligopoly competition is the  
Bertrand model of price competition. The main assumptions in this  
model are that firms produce an identical commodity and that, as in  
the case of perfect competition, all customers buy only from firms offer-  
ing the lowest price. Firms compete on price, and each firm produces  
a quantity sufficient to satisfy *all* the demand it faces at its offered  
price. Firms choose their prices noncooperatively and simultaneously. *The Economics of RM* 383  
We present the model for a duopoly, but the analysis extends easily to  
the firm case.  
Assume there are two firms, denoted 1 and 2. Also, for simplicity  
assume each firm has the same marginal cost As earlier, let the  
market-demand function be denoted by The demand for firm 1 at  
price is given by the demand function  
\(Similarly for firm 2.\) Note the inherent discontinuity in the demand  
function. If firm 2 prices are even a tiny amount below 1’s price‚ firm 1  
will lose all its demand. Firm 1’s profit function is then given by  
Let the Nash equilibrium in prices be denoted The equilib-  
rium in the Bertrand model is in fact very clear-cut\: the unique equi-  
librium is for both firms to price at the marginal cost identical to the 384 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
perfectly competitive prediction. The explanation is as follows. From  
firm 1’s perspective‚ if firm 2 prices at firm 1 has to price at least  
at or else it receives no demand at all. If it is in firm 1’s  
interest to undercut firm 2 slightly and price at for some  
small It then receives all the demand and makes a positive profit.  
But the symmetric argument holds for firm 2‚ which in turn has an in-  
centive to slightly undercut firm 1. This downward sequence of prices  
continues until both firms’ prices reach marginal cost‚ which is the only  
equilibrium.  
Thus‚ under Bertrand’s model‚ firms make zero profits‚ even when  
faced with just one competitor. This result suggests that if the only  
differences between firms are their prices‚ the competitive outcome will  
be quite bleak indeed. While stylized‚ the intuition behind the Bertrand  
model is compelling and helps explain why firms often strive so hard  
to differentiate themselves and avoid head-to-head price competition as  
much as possible.  
The situation is different‚ however‚ if one firm’s marginal cost is lower  
than the others. For example‚ if \(firm 1 is the “low-cost leader”\)‚  
then by the same reasoning as above the unique equilibrium is  
In this case‚ the low-cost firm makes a positive profit since  
but the high-cost firm makes zero profit. It makes sense then  
in this situation for the low-cost firm to emphasize price as the main  
point of differentiation‚ since it benefits from pure price competition.  
A real world example of this situation is the low-cost airlines‚ which—  
because of their lower cost structures—benefit greatly by emphasizing  
price competition. Walmart is another well-known example of a firm  
with a clear low-cost‚ low-price strategy of this sort.  
The extreme prediction of the Bertrand model‚ however‚ demands  
that we examine the main assumptions of the model more closely\:  
Products are homogeneous and identical.  
There are no capacity constraints on a firm’s production.  
Firms have constant marginal costs of production.  
There is one and only one opportunity for strategic interaction.  
The demand model is deterministic.  
Relaxing any one of these assumptions leads to more realistic predic-  
tions‚ albeit at the expense of more complicated analysis. In particular‚  
for RM industries products are usually differentiated‚ capacity restric-  
tions are important‚ demand is uncertain‚ and firms interact frequently *The Economics of RM* 385  
over time. Although we don’t know of static models of oligopoly competi-  
tion that incorporate all these features‚ there are a number of economic  
models in the literature that relax one or the other and derive alter-  
native equilibria predictions. Repeated interactions are the subject of  
Section 8.4.2‚ and Section 8.4.3 covers competition between firms with  
differentiated products. In the next section‚ we look at the effects of  
capacity constaints on the Bertrand model.  
**8.4.1.5 Bertrand-Edgeworth**  
Consider Bertrand’s model in which firms have capacity constraints.  
Demand in excess of the capacity constaints is reallocated to other firms  
according to a rationing rule. In this case‚ multiple prices can exist in the  
market. For instance‚ firm 1 can price higher than firm 2 and still sur-  
vive by receiving all the residual demand that exceeds firm 2’s capacity  
\(assuming that the demand is high enough to cover its costs\). In general‚  
when there are decreasing returns to scale \(the marginal cost increases as  
capacity increases\)‚ the model is called the Bertrand-Edgeworth model  
of price competition. Edgeworth showed that an equilibrium need not  
exist in such a case. \(However‚ mixed-strategy equilibria exist as shown  
below.\) The market will never settle down‚ and prices will cycle between  
high and low values—a pricing pattern known as the *Edgeworth cycle.*  
This is illustrated in the following example\:  
**Example 8.17** An extreme instance of increasing marginal cost occurs when there  
are rigid capacity constraints \(marginal costs above the capacity constraint are in-  
finite\). In the presence of capacity constraints‚ we have to specify a rationing rule.  
We assume the randomized rationing rule \(Section 7.3.5\)‚ where customers arrive at  
random and purchase the lowest-priced product that provides them with a positive  
surplus.  
Suppose there are two firms‚ each with a capacity of 1 and a marginal cost of \$1.  
The demand consists of three customers‚ two of whom have a willingness to pay of \$1  
and the third with a willingness to pay of \$3. Note if one firm prices at \$1‚ the other  
firm has an incentive to price at \$3 since it will then capture the \$3 customer with  
probability 1/2‚ generating a positive expected profit of \$3\(1/2\)–\$1 = \$0.5. However‚  
if one firm prices at any price then the other firm can increase its expected  
profit by pricing at to take away the \$3 customer from its competitor. This  
means that each firm has an incentive to undercut its competitor if the competitor  
prices above marginal cost‚ and yet each firm also has an incentive to raise its price  
if its competitor prices at marginal cost. Firms therefore cycle continuously between  
high and low prices \(the Edgeworth cycle\).  
This example shows that capacity constraints provide an explanation  
for unstable pricing. For example‚ the volatility in airline pricing—  
and the on-and-off price wars observed in that industry—are arguably  
examples of this type of Bertrand-Edgeworth phenomenon. 386 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Although there may be no pure-strategy equilibrium for the Bertrand  
model with capacity restrictions‚ one can show that there exists a mixed-  
strategy equilibrium. Assume a linear inverse-demand curve  
Each of the firms faces a strict capacity limit of *C* and  
sets prices simultaneously and independently.  
THEOREM 8.5 *\(\[341\]‚ \[314\]‚ \[88\]\) Assume the efficient-rationing rule*  
*\(customers with the highest valuations are served first \(7.3.5\)\). Then*  
*\(i\) If an equilibrium is given by*  
*and firms make zero profits.*  
*\(ii\) If the equilibrium is given by*  
*\(iii\) If a mixed-strategy equi-*  
*librium exists and in any such equilibrium‚ expected profit is given by*  
There may be many other factors besides capacity constraints that  
lead to the nonexistence of pure-strategy equilibria in a Bertrand style  
competition or lead to equilibria with positive profits. Indeed‚ consider  
a duopoly where there is a fixed cost *F* of entry‚ in addition to the  
marginal cost of production‚ so that for and  
otherwise. Then according to the assumptions of Bertrand  
competition‚ each firm if it entered would price at the marginal cost  
but then both firms would end up making negative profits‚ so no  
firm supplies the market \(assuming both firms make simultaneous entry  
decisions\). There are a number of such variations of the basic Bertrand  
model. \(See Vives \[539\] and Tirole \[513\].\)  
**8.4.1.6 Cournot *Then* Bertrand-Edgeworth**  
Here we consider a two-stage oligopoly model in which firms choose  
capacities in the first stage, and then in the second stage—knowing each  
others’ capacities—they choose prices. This is a reasonable abstraction,  
for example, of competing retailers ordering quantities at the beginning  
of the season and then pricing the products to clear their stocks; or  
airlines making short-term schedule and capacity decisions in a market  
and then pricing their products afterward.  
Consider a duopoly with a linear-demand function  
and identical marginal costs of capacity as given in Example 8.15 and  
Theorem 8.5.20 We assume Once capacity is chosen in stage 1,  
20We limit our discussion to a linear-demand model for simplicity. The results of Kreps and  
Scheinkman \[314\] apply to more general, differentiable, and concave demand functions. *The Economics of RM* 387  
there are no further costs; that is‚ the marginal cost to serve demand  
is zero. Kreps and Scheinkman \[314\] show that in this two-stage game  
under efficient rationing \(Section 7.3.5\)‚ there is an equilibrium in which  
firms choose exactly the Cournot capacities in the first stage. Thus‚ the  
severe zero-profit outcome of Bertrand price competition is considerably  
tempered when firms must precommit capacity. \(However‚ Davidson  
and Deneckere \[147\] show that this result is sensitive to the form of  
rationing‚ specifically‚ it holds only for efficient rationing.\)  
To show this outcome‚ we use Theorem 8.5‚ extended to a duopoly  
with asymmetric capacities and To do so‚ let denote  
the optimal quantity response of firm to firm capacity choice  
assuming there is no cost to capacity. That is‚  
Kreps and Scheinkman \[314\] show the following crucial result  
THEOREM 8.6 *\(\[314\]\) \(i\) A pure-strategy equilibrium exists only if*  
*and and the prices at this equilibrium are given*  
*by*  
*\(ii\) If or there exists a mixed-strategy equi-*  
*librium‚ and the highest-capacity firm \(that is firm 1\) makes a profit in*  
*the second stage equal to*  
We can use this result to show that the Cournot symmetric equilib-  
rium‚ denoted is an equilibrium of the two-stage game. For our  
linear-demand function‚ \(equation \(8.19\)\)‚ and  
So‚  
To show that is an equilibrium‚ assume that firm 2  
chooses Then if firm 1 chooses  
So by Theorem 8.6\(i\)‚ it has a pure-strategy equilibrium price  
and its revenue‚ So

in the first stage sum to  
But it follows from \(8.19\) that 388 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
So is indeed an equilibrium in capacity choices as  
claimed. Kreps and Scheinkman \[314\]‚ in fact‚ show that this Cournot  
equilibrium in the first stage is unique.  
**8.4.2 Dynamic Models**  
While static models of competition provide important insights on RM  
competition‚ in real life‚ competitors often interact with each other re-  
peatedly over time. For example‚ retailers order and price their products  
every sales season and repeatedly compete with each other in each sea-  
son; airlines periodically adjust schedules fleet assignments‚ and prices  
over time‚ competing with each other in each period. Such repeated  
competitive interaction can lead to very different equilibrium outcomes.  
One important consequence of repeated interaction is the possibility  
of collusion. Of course‚ overt collusion in setting prices or quantities  
is nearly always prohibited by law \(although there are some significant  
exceptions‚ such as the OPEC oil cartel\). Yet under repeated oligopolis-  
tic competition‚ another form of collusion‚ called *tacit collusion‚* is a  
possible equilibrium outcome. Even though firms do not communicate  
with each other or form explicit agreements to collude‚ it can be in each  
firm’s interest in equilibrium to set prices that approach collusive levels.  
In this section‚ we look at models and conditions to sustain or break  
such tacit collusion.  
Chamberlin \[103\] was one of the first economists to point out that  
repeated interaction between oligopolists can facilitate collusion. With  
repeated interactions firms can threaten retaliation \(price wars\) and thus  
ensure that competitors do not deviate from collusive prices. Stigler \[488\]  
modeled factors‚ such as the credibility of threats‚ the speed with which  
competitive moves are detected‚ and the speed of information transmis-  
sion‚ and studied how they affect collusion. While a number of static  
models \(kinked-demand theory and conjectural variations theory\) have  
been developed to address collusion‚ modern industrial organization the-  
ory relies on repeated games to model competitive interactions in an  
oligopoly.  
Models of finitely repeated pricing games‚ somewhat surprisingly‚ turn  
out to say little more than what their static counterparts do. The  
subgame-perfect equilibrium \(see Appendix F\) of a *T*-period Bertrand  
game turns out to be the Bertrand equilibrium \(that is‚ marginal-cost  
pricing\) repeated *T* times. The argument for this is relatively simple *The Economics of RM* 389  
and follows by backward induction\: In the last period‚ the static equi-  
librium is the unique marginal-cost equilibrium. Given this outcome for  
the last period‚ the equilibrium for the next-to-the-last period is again  
the marginal-cost equilibrium‚ and so on. This is disappointing‚ be-  
cause with a repeated game one would like to uncover new equilibrium  
possibilities.  
In infinite games the situation changes; threats‚ retaliation‚ and pun-  
ishment become credible as firms can punish a deviating firm with a price  
war for a sufficient number of periods and then revert back to collusive  
pricing. The basic requirement for this to be implementable is that each  
oligopolist be able to observe defections from collusive pricing quickly.  
When such detection lags are short and price changes are costless and fre-  
quent‚ a collusive outcome is a possible—albeit nonunique—equilibrium.  
On the other hand when detection is difficult‚ the collusiveness breaks  
down‚ and firms revert to marginal-cost pricing even in supergames.  
Thus secret price cuts and private deals undermine collusive pricing.  
Most RM industries have a mixture of public and private prices. Air-  
lines post their fares on reservation systems \(public tariffs\) and at the  
same time make numerous private arrangements with corporations or  
individual travel agents \(negotiated tariffs\). A similar situation holds  
for hotels‚ cruise lines‚ and rental-car companies. It is not unusual to  
see identical pricing by firms for products posted publicly but large vari-  
ations for prices negotiated privately. Retail prices by and large are  
public information‚ but at the same time‚ it is also difficult to gather  
price information.21  
**8.4.2.1 Dynamic Finite Bertrand-Edgeworth**  
As we mentioned‚ the finite-stage version of the Bertrand pricing  
game leads to an equilibrium where firms follow the static Bertrand  
equilibrium \(Section 8.4.1.4\) in each stage. This need not be the case if  
firms have capacity constraints‚ however. We consider here a finite-stage  
duopoly version of the Bertrand-Edgeworth model of Section 8.4.1.5‚ due  
to Dudey \[164\].  
Consider two firms with capacities and that sell a homogeneous  
good to *N* customers \(*N* is assumed to be known to both firms\) at  
prices and respectively. Each customer has a reservation price  
and chooses to buy from the low-price firm‚ and if both prices are the  
same‚ will choose one of the two firms with equal probability. If  
21Notable exceptions occur in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry‚ which maintains a database  
of prices‚ and e-commerce sites—however‚ even the latter make it difficult for robots to gather  
prices automatically. 390 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and the customer does not purchase from either firm. Firms  
can change the price dynamically and quote a price for each customer  
separately. If a firm sells out its capacity‚ its price is assumed to be set  
at Assume the marginal cost of a sale is where Assume  
the discount factor is one for both firms.  
Let period correspond to customer At any given  
period there are remaining customers. Let and  
represent remaining capacities for the firms at the beginning of period  
and Let and represent prices  
quoted by the firms for the customer in period Firms are assumed  
to know *N‚* and the history of prices prior to but not necessarily  
and However‚ knowing the price history‚ *N*‚ and firms  
can accurately infer and  
These informational assumptions of the model are rather restrictive‚  
as in practice firms usually do not know either or *N* \(and hence cannot  
infer or the remaining capacities of the other firm\). However‚ this  
model is a reasonable stylized representation of RM dynamics under  
competition.  
**Case 1\:** The equilibrium analysis breaks up into different cases\:  
Firm 1 cannot supply the entire market‚ but  
firm 2 can. In this case‚ let firm 1’s strategy be  
and firm 2’s strategy  
These strategies are shown in \[164\] to be a *unique* equilibrium to the  
finite-stage game. Note that if at any time the result  
is a dynamic Bertrand game from onward, and both firms make zero  
profits. So it turns out that firm 2 is better off letting the smaller-  
capacity rival sell out and then move to monopoly price. To see why,  
consider a point when, say, firm 1 has a capacity of units, there  
are 101 remaining customers and firm 2 has a capacity of  
Firms have no reason to price at values other than firm 1’s strategy, if firm 2 prices at until or Given  
\(until at least *The Economics of RM* 391  
one customer buys from firm 2 first\)‚ its expected profit22 is  
However‚ if it follows the strategy \(8.27\)‚ waiting for firm 1 to sell out‚ its  
profit is Firm 1 earns and firm 2 earns  
Depending on *N* and firm 1‚ the one with the smaller capacity‚ can  
make higher profits.  
**Case 2\:** profit of Both firms set their prices equal to unless  
their capacity is 0‚ in which case they set it to Firm 1 makes a  
and firm 2 a profit of  
In general‚ if at any period and  
both firms set their prices equal to  
**Case 3\:** Both firms set their prices equal to unless  
their capacity is 0‚ in which case they set it to Both firms make  
0 profits.  
In general if at any period both firms set  
their prices equal to  
**Case 4\:** Both firms set their prices equal to  
or in general‚ if at any stage  
both firms set their period prices equal to  
This is the strangest case because firms can price below cost. Say  
and If customer 101 purchases from one of  
the firms‚ then the subsequent equilibrium yields for the other  
firm and for the firm that made the sale to customer 101. If  
instead‚ both firms set their prices equal to then both  
firms earn This is an equilibrium because‚ given the other firm  
sets raising the price above will fetch  
and lowering it below will fetch less than  
So even though the static Bertrand-Edgeworth need not have a pure-  
strategy equilibrium‚ the finite-stage version can have unique equilibrium  
strategies in a duopoly. While the existence of the equilibrium makes  
this model appealing‚ the conclusions are rather odd indeed \(especially‚  
Case 4\). There is also a disproportionate sharing of profits‚ with the  
firm with the smaller capacity always coming out best. One is therefore  
led to suspect the assumptions of the model.  
22Calculated as follows\: The first term represents the next customer buying from firm 2‚  
after which‚ they revert to Bertrand. This makes firm 2 a profit of The second  
term represents the next customer buys from firm 1‚ and the one after that buys from firm  
2‚ in which case firm 2 makes and so on. 392 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**8.4.2.2 Dynamic Infinite Bertrand**  
We next consider infinitely repeated Bertrand competition. It turns  
out that almost any price up to the monopoly price can be sustained  
in equilibrium‚ and there are an infinite number of possible equilibria.  
Nevertheless‚ it is a good place to start understanding the supergame  
framework.  
Consider two firms competing in a repeated Bertrand game over an  
infinite horizon. In each period there is exactly one customer who pur-  
chases based on the Bertrand formula \(8.24\). Future profits are dis-  
counted by a factor In period firms simultaneously set prices  
and and collect a payoff  
Firms maximize  
The one-shot Bertrand equilibrium‚ where both firms price at marginal  
can be shown to be a \(stationary\) equilibrium to this infinite  
cost game.  
However‚ there are many other possible equilibria based on the con-  
cepts of credible threats and trigger strategies. Let be the monopoly  
price \(maximizing A *trigger strategy* for a firm is to price at  
if the other firm has priced at for all preceding periods and to price  
at otherwise. So each firm *threatens* the other firm with marginal-cost  
pricing forever if the other firm deviates in any period from the \(collu-  
sive\) price  
A trigger-price strategy is an equilibrium as long as To see  
this‚ note that if a firm deviates by from in period it receives a  
profit of in that period and zero from then on. On the other  
hand‚ if it sticks to the trigger strategy‚ it receives a profit of  
as long as In fact‚ one can substitute any between and  
and reason the same way to show that it too can be sustained in  
equilibrium.  
**8.4.2.3 Cournot Followed by Dynamic Infinite**  
# Bertrand-Edgeworth  
The two-stage Kreps and Scheinkman model of Section 8.4.1.6 showed  
that an equilibrium for the first-stage Cournot game in which the payoff *The Economics of RM* 393  
is given by a second stage of Bertrand-Edgeworth competition is the  
same as the one-shot Cournot capacity prediction of Section 8.4.1.1‚ and  
both firms set the market-clearing price in the second stage. Do the  
results change if the second-stage game is an infinite-period Bertrand-  
Edgeworth game? That is‚ firms‚ after they choose their capacities‚ have  
*many* opportunities to adjust their prices. This question was explored  
by Benoit and Krishna \[46\]‚ and we present their results below.  
First of all‚ one equilibrium to this Cournot and infinite Bertrand-  
Edgeworth game turns out to be setting Cournot capacities in the first  
stage and the Cournot prices for every period during the price competi-  
tion phase. Call this the *stationary Cournot equilibrium.* But—and this  
is generally no surprise in a supergame—there are many other equilibria  
for this Cournot and infinite Bertrand-Edgeworth game.  
THEOREM 8.7 *\(\[46\]‚ \[88\]\) For all discount factors and for*  
*all choice of capacities chosen by the firms‚ there exists a price*  
*such that is a subgame-perfect equilibrium for the*  
*second-stage infinite-horizon Bertrand-Edgeworth game.*  
All equilibria other than the stationary Cournot equilibrium share  
some common properties. *All* equilibria for the Cournot and infinite  
Bertrand-Edgeworth game‚ except the stationary Cournot equilibrium‚  
will have the firms choosing excess capacity in the first stage—excess  
capacity in the sense that firms do not use this capacity in the second  
stage but build it solely to threaten their rivals with a price drop if  
they deviate from the collusive prices. We show this informally by the  
following arguments\:  
If firms will share the demand equally‚ and if firm 1  
will first get a demand of  
and firm 2 will get a residual demand of  
If firm 2 gets the demand first and then firm 1 will get the  
residual demand. *Excess capacity* is defined as when either firm chooses  
capacity  
Define firm 1’s minmax revenue as the least amount firm 2 can hold  
firm 1’s revenue down to. That is‚ 394 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and vice versa for firm 2.  
Suppose that both firms choose in the first stage  
in a stationary perfect-equilibrium path‚ and that are not the  
Cournot equilibrium capacities \(say‚ because is not a best-response  
for firm 1 in the first stage Cournot game\). Then there exists some  
capacity such that  
Consider  
as So firm 1 would prefer to use capacity and  
get its minmax revenue for the second-stage price game than use  
Similarly for firm 2. Hence must be the Cournot equilibrium.  
If exactly one firm—say‚ firm 1—has excess capacity; that is‚  
Then \(shortening to  
and using the same argument as of \(8.29\)  
So firm 1 would use capacity rather than in the  
stationary perfect-equilibrium path‚ and we can say\:  
PROPOSITION 8.2 *If and is a stationary*  
*perfect equilibrium path of this \(two-stage‚ infinite\) game‚ then either*  
*\(i\) is a Cournot equilibrium or \(ii\) for all both firms have*  
*excess capacity.*  
Benoit and Krishna \[46\] furthermore prove the following theorem for  
nonstationary equilibrium paths\:  
THEOREM 8.8 *\(\[46\]\) If and form a*  
*subgame-perfect equilibrium path of the Cournot and infinite Bertrand-*  
*Edgeworth game‚ either*  
*\(i\) is a Cournot equilibrium and Cournot prices‚*  
*for all t or*  
*\(ii\) for an infinite number of periods* *The Economics of RM* 395  
The intuition is that firms cannot avoid excess capacity; if they  
both choose small capacities‚ each has an incentive to expand because  
its capacity-constrained competitor is unable to retaliate in the price-  
competition phase. Yet if both choose large capacities‚ it is unprofitable  
for each to fully utilize their capacities.  
**8.4.3 Product Differentiation**  
Thus far we have assumed that firms produce an identical‚ perfectly  
substitutable product \(a commodity\). Yet this is rarely the case in real  
world markets. Customer tastes and preferences differ‚ and it is in the  
firms’ interest to differentiate their products‚ both to exploit customers’  
willingness to pay for different features and to mitigate the effects of  
competition. RM industries are characterized by their rich diversity  
of products and features. The features may differ physically \(fashion  
apparel‚ airline schedules and service‚ hotel location‚ network ratings\)  
or may differ in their terms of trade. For such differentiated products  
markets‚ what does economic theory say about competitive outcomes?  
The effect is significant. Even in a Bertrand-style pricing game‚ equi-  
librium prices can exceed marginal cost. The premium is directly pro-  
portional to a measure of the customer’s taste for diversity and also the  
number of firms in the market.  
**8.4.3.1 Static Model**  
Consider a static-pricing game of a duopoly with a product each. For  
illustration‚ we derive the equilibrium price assuming customer purchase  
behavior follows a multinomial-logit \(MNL\) model.  
Let *N* denote the number of customers‚ denote the price of firm  
1 and that of firm 2. The products are differentiated by a set of  
attributes‚ and customers preference for these attributes may make them  
choose a product from a firm even if the product is priced higher than  
the other.  
The customer’s taste for such diversity is modeled by a factor  
The probability that a customer will buy product *i* is given by  
When tends to zero‚ it means customers are indifferent to the product  
characteristics and buy based purely on price‚ whereas when is very  
high‚ they are quite insensitive to price and buy each product with equal  
probability. 396 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Let be the marginal cost of production and *K* the fixed cost of  
production. Then the profit function for firm is given by  
This function turns out to be strictly quasiconcave \(under the logit  
assumption of our model; see \[16\]‚ p.222\). Differentiating the profit  
functions of firms 1 and 2 with respect to and and setting them to  
zero simultaneously gives the symmetric equilibrium for the firms as  
The result can be extended to a oligopoly to give  
Thus‚ the equilibrium price is above marginal cost‚ and the lower the  
price sensitivity‚ the higher the premium above marginal cost—quite a  
different outcome than the one obtained in the commodity Bertrand  
competition case. This outcome suggests why firms strive so hard to  
differentiate their products and services; it is one way to avoid the  
zero-profit outcome of head-to-head price competition. \(For variations  
and analysis on optimal product diversity‚ see Anderson‚ de Palma‚ and  
Thisse \[16\].\)  
**8.4.3.2 Dynamic RM Competition in Allocations and**  
# Prices  
In Section 8.4.2.1‚ we have seen a dynamic model of price competition  
in a duopoly where the firms have fixed capacities\: The price competi-  
tion in each period was modeled as a Bertrand game—firms can observe  
each others’ remaining capacities‚ and the buyers are assumed to always  
purchase from one of the firms. In this section‚ we relax these assump-  
tions the following way. Firms sell differentiated products and make  
available an offer set as in quantity-based RM. Customers consider the  
offer sets from each firm and make a purchase decision based on a choice  
rule. Customers have a no-purchase option‚ and they decide not to pur-  
chase with a certain positive probability. In contrast to the findings of  
the model in Section 8.4.2.1‚ an equilibrium need not always exist under  
this model‚ and the no-purchase option plays a crucial role on whether  
it does or not.  
**Model** The model‚ in fact‚ can be considered the duopoly version of the  
dynamic discrete-choice model of quantity-based RM of Section 2.6.2  
\(with elements from the differentiated products competition model of *The Economics of RM* 397  
Section 8.4.3.1\). Let’s recall some of the elements of this model. Time is  
discrete‚ and there are *T* periods until the time of service. The resources  
of both firms are consumed simultaneously at time *T.* Bookings occur  
during the intervals 0 to *T* with at most one arrival during each period.  
A customer arrives in a period‚ observes the available choices of the two  
firms‚ and then‚ based on the prices and attributes of the fare products‚  
either decides to buy one of the products of one of the firms or decides  
not to purchase any of the available products. Let 0 represent this no-  
purchase alternative.  
We assume a MNL customer choice model with a no-purchase alter-  
native. In each period there is a probability of a customer arrival. If  
a customer does not purchase in a period‚ he does not reappear in a  
later period. Since the choice model is MNL‚ a customer’s probability  
of choosing an available product of firm when firm 1 offers the set  
and firm 2 offers the set can be represented for convenience by  
where the weights and are formed by the prices and and  
possibly other attributes of the products and firms‚ and is the weight  
of the no-purchase alternative.  
Firms have capacities of and units and and RM products  
respectively that share the capacities. Firms can observe each others’  
remaining capacities and choose offer sets simultaneously in each period.  
They fix the prices of the products and  
initially and keep them fixed throughout the booking horizon. At the  
beginning of each period‚ each firm makes available a subset of its fare  
products. So even though prices are fixed‚ the firms can influence the  
prices that a consumer sees in each period by changing the offer set.  
Although specific to a choice rule with the the logit functional form‚ this  
model captures both customer choice and the dynamics of availability  
controls in quantity-based RM.  
**Equilibrium Analysis** The state space is the firms’ remaining capac-  
ities‚ and The reaction function of a firm is based on its own  
remaining capacity‚ its competitor’s remaining capacity‚ and its com-  
petitor’s current offer set.  
As we saw in Section 2.6.2‚ under the MNL customer-choice model in  
the monopoly case a firm’s optimal offer set has the nested-by-revenue  
order property‚ which means that each firm needs to consider only com-  
plete sets. That is‚ for firm 1‚ sets of the form for  
and for firm 2‚ sets of the form for 398 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
are optimal. This property carries over to the duopoly  
case‚ so we assume from now on that the strategy spaces for the firms  
are these complete sets. We represent the collection of all complete sets  
as for firm 1 and for firm 2. We will say that if  
or‚ as the sets are nested‚ If we denote the set  
difference as  
The value function for firm 1 at time given firm 2 offers is given  
by the following\:  
where is the equilibrium revenue to go from period onward.  
There are two things to note about \(8.30\)\: \(1\) it is defined at time  
only if there is an equilibrium from until T‚ and \(2\) if there are multiple  
equilibria‚ we assume \(exogenously\) that one equilibrium is chosen so  
that the value function is again uniquely defined. The value function  
for firm 2 is defined similarly. We let denote firm 1’s  
revenue if it uses to react to firm  
While equation \(8.30\) looks complicated‚ in words it simply says that  
given that firm 2 chooses offer set firm 1’s revenue is the current  
period’s revenue plus the expected revenue to go in the next period‚  
which depends on the new capacity state for each firm in the next period.  
To analyze this recursion‚ let us rewrite equation \(8.30\)‚ using the fact  
that  
as *The Economics of RM* 399  
Let and  
Let represent the term  
For simplicity we just write as whenever there is no  
room for confusion. Notice that for firm 1 is independent of the  
strategies of firm 2‚ and vice versa for firm 2.  
The following relationships are intuitive and not hard to show rigor-  
ously\:  
and  
Note that  
As prices are decreasing in as firm offers larger sets‚ the func-  
tion increases monotonically first and then decreases monotoni-  
cally \(that is‚ it is unimodal\). The function can also be negative.  
It could be the case that is negative for all strategies of firm Fig-  
ure 8.4 shows the two possibilities for firm where is the set that  
has the maximum value of We call the case where as Case  
I‚ and Case II when  
PROPOSITION 8.3 *\[503\] When both firms are in Case I‚ or both are in*  
*Case II‚ there exists an equilibrium in offer sets.*  
The difficulty is if one firm is in Case I and the other in Case II.  
Consider the following example\:  
**Example 8.18** Suppose firm 1 and firm 2 have the data given in the following table\:  
*Firm 1*  
*Firm 2*

Then the payoff and best-response arcs are as given in Figure 8.5‚ and it can be seen  
that there is a cycle and no equilibrium‚ even for the MNL choice function. 400 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
So even though the single-period problem always has an equilibrium  
the competitive game over a finite number of periods‚  
may end up having no equilibrium. Notice that this is not a repeated  
game\: the dynamic program has strong intertemporal relationships‚ and  
the parameters of the game change over time.  
One can give some conditions on the choice model parameters that  
guarantees existence of an equilibrium. Define for  
which represents the weighted-average price for the products from to *The Economics of RM* 401  
PROPOSITION 8.4 *If for the choice model satisfy*  
*and for any the parameters of*  
*then there exists a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the subsets that each*  
*firm offers at every time interval*  
The condition for Proposition 8.4 holds, for instance, when  
That is, if a period has a customer arrival and available inventory, that  
period will have a sale.  
In the finite Bertrand-Edgeworth game of Section 8.4.2.1 an equilib-  
rium always exists. In that model too firms can observe each other’s  
capacities, but the customer in each period will always purchase from  
one of the two firms to if there is available inventory.  
So the no-purchase option plays a crucial role indeed; its relative mag-  
nitude determines whether we have an equilibrium in the game or not.  
Figure 8.6 shows the intuition behind why modeling the no-purchase  
option introduces the instability into the game under certain circum-  
stances.  
While Example 8.18 is somewhat discouraging, it is not indicative of  
a nonequilibrium in many interesting cases, such as the following\: if the  
two firms have equal capacities, identical products, and customers, then  
will we see equilibrium in the offer sets? Example 8.18 is not applicable,  
and it is possible that one can derive conditions on and to show the  
existence of an equilibrium. Indeed, Example 8.18 is not even conclusive  
for the general case; it does not show that the and used actually arise 402 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
in a dynamic game. So there are still many gaps in our understanding  
of quantity-based RM competition, even for a duopoly.  
The results of this section also extend to a choice model where cus-  
tomers choose the lowest-available product in the offer sets. If there is a  
single segment \(as we assumed here\) of customers, then this is essentially  
equivalent to firms offering a single price in each time-period—that is,  
dynamic pricing. Customers then have three options\: no-purchase or  
purchase at the price offered by firm 1 or from firm 2. One needs to  
impose a few conditions on the parameters of the choice model, how-  
ever\: the weights are decreasing functions of the price, and is uni-  
modal. For instance, the logit model with weights of the form used in  
Section 8.4.3.1 satisfy this property.

# ESTIMATION AND FORECASTING  
**9.1 Introduction**  
A revenue management system requires forecasts of quantities such as  
demand, price sensitivity, and cancellation probabilities, and its perfor-  
mance depends critically on the quality of these forecasts. Indeed, some  
industry estimates suggest that a 20% reduction of forecast error can  
translate into a 1% incremental increase in revenue generated from the  
RM system \(Poelt \[424\]\). While it is difficult to generalize from such  
figures, there is little doubt that good forecasting is vitally important for  
RM. In practice, forecasting is a high-profile task of RM, consuming the  
vast majority of development, maintenance, and implementation time.  
The term *forecast* may conjure up the notion of a single number, such  
as the demand for a specific day on a specific flight in the future or  
demand for a particular item at a retail store \(a so-called *point esti-*  
*mate*\). *A.* certain amount of misunderstanding about RM forecasting is  
not uncommon among nontechnical analysts and managers, who are ac-  
customed to thinking of forecasts as a single number. However, a point  
estimate is almost never accurate; a forecast is more complicated than  
a single number and needs to be understood in statistical terms that  
account for the inherent uncertainty in predicting future outcomes.  
In this chapter, we examine forecasting for RM. We start with an  
overview of the role of forecasting in RM—surveying the available data  
sources, forecasting strategies and methodologies, and factors involved  
in actually operationalizing a RM forecasting system. The remainder of  
the chapter describes estimation and forecasting methods in more depth.  
While our discussion is centered on RM forecasting, most of the tech-  
niques we describe are not particular to RM and as such can safely 408 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
be described as *standard.* Indeed, there are many excellent textbooks  
devoted to estimation and forecasting, and it is not our intention to  
approach them in scope and depth. Rather, this chapter is intended  
as a primer on the subject—sufficient in coverage to give a good sense  
of the range of methods and issues involved in RM forecasting but not  
providing an in-depth reference on any one method. We do, however,  
give enough detail to understand and implement at least a basic version  
of each method. To implement and maintain a high-quality, production-  
level RM forecasting system, one needs to know more about the nuances  
of each forecasting method, and the reader in this situation is encour-  
aged to consult a specialized source for such information. \(The Notes  
and Sources section at the end of the chapter contains references to a  
number of books dedicated to estimation and forecasting.\)  
**9.1.1 The Forecasting Module of RM Systems**  
RM forecasting presents many challenges to a system designer. For  
one, a significant amount of programming work is involved in collecting  
and manipulating the data to convert it into the required data feeds for  
the forecasting module. Large volumes of transactional data have to be  
gathered from multiple sources, either in real time or on an overnight  
batch basis. The database design is an important issue because in many  
large-scale implementations, an immense number of records have to be  
retrieved, updated, and added within a small time window. Data back-  
up procedures take up further time. All these data and systems issues  
must be addressed prior to actual forecasting itself.  
Figure 9.1 shows a schematic of the process flow of a typical quantity-  
based RM system and where the forecasting module resides in the process.  
The outputs of the forecasting module are fed to the optimization mod-  
ule, which produces RM controls such as markdown prices, booking  
limits, bid prices, and overbooking limits. In the stage between forecast-  
ing and optimization, most RM systems also give analysts monitoring  
and overriding ability over the forecasts. These so-called *user influ-*  
*ences* are used to either increase or decrease the forecasts at different  
levels of aggregation before they are used in optimization. Indeed, in  
most quantity-based RM systems, analysts are not permitted to change  
capacity controls directly but can change them only indirectly by manip-  
ulating the forecast inputs. This practice is based on the belief \(wide-  
spread among RM practitioners\) that knowledge of markets or special  
conditions can sometimes make human analysts better than algorithms  
at forecasting demand, but rarely, if ever, can human analysts set RM  
controls better than optimization algorithms. *Estimation and Forecasting* 409 410 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
In most RM systems, forecasting is automated, transactional, and  
data-driven—as opposed to qualitative \(such as expert opinion\) or  
survey-based. This is primarily due to the sheer volume of forecasts  
that have to be made and the tight processing-time requirements. These  
practical constraints limit the choice of forecasting algorithms. They also  
limit the types of data that can reasonably be collected and the amount  
of time a user can spend calibrating and verifying forecasts. Often, cer-  
tain forecasting procedures, even if they give superior forecasts, may not  
be a viable option because they take too long to run, require data that is  
too expensive to collect \(say, using surveys\), or require too much expert,  
manual effort to calibrate.  
For quantity-based RM, most systems use time-series methods, which  
use historical data to project the future. For price-based RM systems  
\(retail RM, for example\), one is usually interested in forecasting demand  
as a function of marketing variables such as price or promotion. As a  
result, causal forecast models, which use explanatory variables such as  
prices, weather or economic indicators, play a bigger role in price-based  
RM.  
**9.1.2 What Forecasts Are Required?**  
RM forecasting requirements are driven by the input requirements  
of the optimization module. As we saw in previous chapters, most op-  
timization models use stochastic models of demand and hence require  
an estimate of the complete probability distribution or at least parame-  
ter estimates \(e.g., means and variances\) for an assumed distribution.  
Moreover, forecasting aggregate demand is just one of a host of quan-  
tities that need to be estimated in a RM system. Many other features  
of the demand—how it evolves over time, what percentage cancel, how  
it responds to a promotion—are also important in making good control  
decisions, and need forecasting.  
**Quantity-Based RM Forecasts** Quantity-based RM industries like  
airlines and hotels have a wide variety of forecasting requirements. For  
example, in addition to the demand data, characterizing the way reser-  
vations for different customer types arrive during the booking period is  
important for some optimization models. Thus, so-called *booking-curve*  
or *booking-profile forecasting* is usually an important task.  
Cancellation and no-show probabilities usually have to be estimated  
as well. Cancellation probabilities tend to be a function of time. \(A  
customer who books early may have a higher probability of cancelling  
than one who books later.\) Therefore, forecasting a cancellation *curve*  
over time may be more appropriate, giving better information to the *Estimation and Forecasting* 411  
optimization module. No-shows occur at the time of service; hence,  
assuming that a customer shows up with a certain probability is often  
an appropriate model of no-shows \(see Chapter 4\). Both no-show and  
cancellation-rate forecasts have to be calculated for future customers as  
well as customers who have already booked. For existing reservations,  
however, additional sources of information, such as the customer’s own  
past history of cancelling, whether the reservation has been paid and  
ticketed, and characteristics of how the reservation was made \(channel,  
time, etc.\) can be used, increasing the data-gathering requirements.  
Revenue values are also critical inputs to optimization modules. Of-  
ten, these values change over time or are uncertain, so the prices at which  
the products will be sold in the future may have to be forecasted. Pre-  
dicting revenue values can be a major challenge, especially when prices  
change rapidly and competitive forces drive pricing.  
Optimization models may also require estimates of cross-selling and  
up-selling probabilities. The buy-up factors discussed in Section 2.6.1  
may have to be estimated from historical data. Spill and recapture are  
two other quantities that are sometimes required in setting \(or at least  
managing\) RM controls. *Spill* refers to the amount of demand that is  
lost by closing down a class or because a compartment is sold out, while  
*recapture* is the amount of this spilled demand that is recaptured by the  
firm’s substitute products. The discrete-choice model of Section 2.6.2,  
requires estimates of the parameters of a choice model, sometimes by  
channel of distribution or by customer segment.  
**Price-Based RM Forecasts** For price-based RM, somewhat different  
forecasts are required. One common requirement is an estimate of the  
parameters of a demand function—or at least an estimate of the price  
sensitivity at the current price. Cross-price elasticity estimates may  
also be required when there are significant substitution effects \(say, for  
category pricing in a retail store\), which vastly increases the scale of the  
forecasting task. In addition, forecasts of demand at the current price,  
the size of the potential customer population, stockout and low-inventory  
effects, and switching behavior may be required. Such estimates require  
looking at the historical price-demand relationship of the product or  
similar products or at intertemporal panel tracking data. Some retailers  
have also tried intelligent experimentation in real time to estimate how  
consumers will respond to various price changes \(*live price testing*\).  
In summary, the forecasting requirements in even a modestly large RM  
system are daunting, indeed. It is little wonder, then, that developing  
a good forecasting system is so vitally important for a successful RM  
implementation. 412 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**9.1.3 Data Sources**  
Data is the life-blood of a forecasting system. Therefore, identifying  
which sources of data are available and how they can best be used is an  
important first step in developing a forecasting system.  
Most RM systems in practice rely primarily on historical sales data  
to construct forecasts. While this leads to highly efficient systems for  
data collection, forecast calibration, and automated forecasting, relying  
on historical data has its weaknesses. For example, in industries where  
products change frequently—when an airline offers service to a new city  
or at a new time for instance—there is often little historical data on  
which to base forecasts. Similarly, in media RM, forecasts for rating of  
new programs must be constructed despite the fact that their ratings  
often have little relationship to the ratings observed for past programs.  
Fashion apparel retailers, for instance, have to estimate sales of new  
styles that may be only vaguely similar to the styles sold in the past.  
In addition, even if the product stays constant, major changes in the  
economy, competing technologies, or industry structure may render past  
data of little use in predicting the future.  
In short, if no explicit relationships with external data sources are  
tracked, the forecasting system will be “blind” to outside events. The  
same is true with respect to changes in competitors’ products and prices.  
In cases where such external data is ignored, it is common practice in  
RM to rely on analysts to monitor outside events and compensate by  
adjusting forecasts appropriately through so-called *user influences.*  
**9.1.3.1 Sales-Transaction Data Sources**  
The main sources of data in most RM systems are transactional  
databases—for example, reservation and property management systems  
\(PMSs\), CRM and ERP databases, and retail inventory and scanner  
databases. Further descriptions of these data sources are given in Chap-  
ters 10 and 11. These sources may be centralized, independent entities  
shared by other firms in the industry \(such as GDSs of the airline in-  
dustry selling MIDT data\), a centralized facility within a company that  
interfaces with several local systems \(a retail chain’s point-of-sale \(POS\)  
system linking all its stores\), a local reservation system \(a hotel PMS\), or  
customer-oriented databases with information on individual customers  
and their purchase history \(customer-relationship management \(CRM\)  
systems and PNR databases\).  
For quantity-based RM, the most widely used transactional data  
source is the reservations database. Reservation databases typically  
store customer data in two formats\: either as an aggregate number *Estimation and Forecasting* 413  
of bookings in a class \(total bookings\) or as information about each  
individual booking, called a *customer booking record* \(*passenger name*  
*record \(PNR\)* in the airline industry\). Forecasts may be based on either  
the aggregate bookings or individual customer booking records. The  
aggregate bookings data contain information only on the total number  
booked in each fare class, while the individual booking records contain  
much more specific information on each customer—such as their name,  
address, booking time, number of units booked, amount paid, frequent  
flyer or other loyalty program number, booking class, cancellation time,  
capacity used \(length of stay and room number for a hotel, car type and  
duration for a rental-car company, or itinerary for an airline\), ancillary  
spending \(dining expenses, telephone calls\). The customer record may  
also contain links to other customer records \(for example, for a group  
booking\) that may be useful for forecasting.  
For retail RM, factory-shipment data, store-level scanner data,  
consumer-panel data, regional demographic data, and advertising and  
promotions data are the primary data used. Industry-wide aggregate  
scanner data \(sold by firms such as Information Resources, Inc. and  
A.C. Nielsen\). Warehouse-shipment data can be obtained from Selling  
Areas Marketing, Inc. \(SAMI\), which provides sales, average price, and  
distribution information for the U.S.  
Panel data, obtained from tracking purchases of a group of panelists  
over time, provides valuable information on cross-sectional and intertem-  
poral purchase behavior. Such data are widely used in retail and media  
industries. A panel member’s purchase data is also linked to promotions,  
availability, displays, advertising, couponing, and markdowns through  
the time of purchase, allowing for precise inferences on preferences and  
marketing influences. Many marketing research companies provide such  
panel-data services.  
# 9.1.3.2 Controls-Data Sources  
In addition to sales information, databases often store information  
on the controlling process itself. Examples of this kind of data include  
records of when a class is closed for further bookings, snapshots of bid  
prices used in the control, overbooking authorizations, past prices, and  
promotion activities. Such information is of great use in correcting for  
unobservable no-purchase decisions by potential customers \(Section 9.4\).  
Industrywide database systems \(such as a GDSs in the travel indus-  
try\) may also yield additional information for forecasting—for example,  
the availability of competitor bookings, prices of competing products,  
and market share. Many airline GDS companies make this information  
available on a weekly or monthly basis on tapes called *market infor-* 414 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
*mation data tapes \(MIDT\).* Although few airlines at present use this  
information in their RM systems, it is useful for estimating competitive  
market share, and for longer-term, strategic planning and analysis.  
For markdown pricing and other price-based RM applications, the  
control decisions are past history of prices and promotions. Most retail  
POS systems store this information routinely. For in-store displays or  
bundle pricing, the POS data has to be merged with a marketing data-  
base. Inventory data is also provided by many retail POS systems, and  
this data is useful for correcting for stockouts and broken-assortments  
effects \(missing color-size combinations\).  
**9.1.3.3 Auxiliary Data Sources**  
A few auxiliary data sources also play a big role in RM forecasting  
in some industries. For instance, currency exchange-rate and tax infor-  
mation is necessary to keep track of revenue value for sales in different  
countries. In the airline industry, the schedules and possible connections  
\(provided by firms such as OAG\) are required to determine what markets  
are being served. If a ticket is sold across multiple airlines, the various  
prorating agreements affect the ultimate revenue value of each product  
sold. A revenue accounting system keeps track of such agreements and  
calculates the net revenue.  
In broadcasting, ratings, customer location, and demographic infor-  
mation is required. A causal forecasting method may take into account  
information on the state of the economy, employment, income and sav-  
ings rates, among other factors. A rental-car firm can use advance travel  
bookings to predict its own demand at airport locations. Information on  
ad-hoc events \(special events\) like conferences, sports events, concerts,  
holidays, is also crucial in improving the accuracy of forecasts. Many  
forecasting systems allow the users to manually enter information on  
such events.  
Many retail RM systems also use weather data, which is supplied  
by several independent vendors via daily automated feeds. Short-term  
weather forecasts guide discounting and stocking decisions \(for example,  
a snow-storm could suggest high demand for snow shovels\). Weather  
data also plays an important role in energy forecasting for electric power  
generators and distributors.  
Macroeconomic data \(such as GNP growth rates and housing starts\)  
is rarely used in automated, tactical forecasting but frequently plays a  
role in aggregate forecasts of factors such as competitors’ costs, industry  
demand and market share, and broad consumer preferences. Statistics  
on cost of labor are published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \(BLS\)  
in the United States in a monthly publication called *Employment and* *Estimation and Forecasting* 415  
*Earnings,* which provides average hourly earnings for workers by product  
category. BLS also provides monthly producer price indexes on raw  
materials.  
For products sold through distributors, important data is not always  
available. For example, an automobile manufacturer may not know the  
final price paid by a customer because dealers have no obligation to  
report this information back to the manufacturer. Similarly, trade pro-  
motions may lead to increased shipments for the manufacturer, but the  
distributor may simply stock up during the trade deal and sell at a  
normal price, reducing the impact of the promotion. Lack of such infor-  
mation is one of the impediments for many firms contemplating RM.  
**9.1.3.4 Partial-Bookings Data**  
In most quantity-based RM applications, bookings occur over an ex-  
tended period of time, yet the product or service is provided on a very  
frequent basis, often daily. For example, an airline may sell seats on a  
flight that operates every day, but bookings can occur over a period of  
12 months prior to departure; hotels take reservations for rooms for each  
day, yet bookings are made many days or weeks in advance. In such sit-  
uations, there are often large quantities of so-called *partial-booking data*  
in the reservation system. While incomplete, such data is quite useful  
for forecasting.  
Figure 9.2 shows an example of partial-bookings data, indicating the  
number of bookings observed each day for capacity in the past as well  
as the future. The represents the date of service \(such as the  
departure date in the airline case or the check-in date for a hotel\), and  
the represents the number of days prior to the date of the service.  
One way to use these partial histories of bookings is to forecast the  
*increments* of demand for each booking day, rather than forecasting the  
total demand to come. Thus, for example, data on the demand received  
on the day prior to service can be used to predict demand on the  
day prior to service in the future, even though the data may be  
from a booking history that is incomplete. Such methods are discussed  
in more detail in Section 9.3.9.  
**9.1.4 Design Decisions**  
After the data sources are identified, one has to make a number of  
design decisions regarding the forecasting strategy and methodology.  
Here we look at the main design decisions in qualitative terms. 416 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**9.1.4.1 Parametric or Nonparametric Forecasts?**  
As mentioned in Section 9.1.2, in most RM forecasting we are in-  
terested in estimating a probability distribution of future demand—or  
in estimating demand as a function of price variables or product at-  
tributes. Such estimates can be made in one of two ways. The first is  
to assume a specific functional form and then estimate the parameters  
of this functional form. This approach is called *parametric estimation.*  
Alternatively, distributions or functions can be estimated directly based  
on observed historical data, without assuming any a *priori* functional  
form. This approach is called *nonparametric estimation.* Choosing be-  
tween a parametric or nonparametric approach to forecasting is a basic  
design decision.  
While nonparametric methods are in a sense more general, they are  
not necessarily a better choice. Nonparametric estimates suffer from  
two serious drawbacks\: First, because they do not use a functional form  
to “fill in” for missing values, they often require much more information  
than is available in many RM applications to obtain reasonable estimates  
of a distribution or demand function. Second, even with sufficient data,  
nonparametric estimates may not be as good at predicting the future,  
even if they fit the historical data well. Parametric models are better  
able to “smooth out” the noise inherent in raw data, which often results  
in a more robust forecast. Indeed, we know of no RM systems that use  
purely nonparametric methods to estimate demand, though several use  
nonparametric methods in selected places. Neural networks, which are  
sometimes viewed as *semiparametric* methods, have been reported in  
several RM applications, and these we cover later in this chapter. *Estimation and Forecasting* 417  
Parametric methods usually are much more modest in their data re-  
quirements, have the advantage of providing estimates of demand that  
extend beyond the range of the observed data \(allow for extrapolation\),  
and are generally more robust to errors and noise in the data. The  
disadvantage of parametric techniques is that some properties of the  
distribution must be assumed—for example, that it is symmetric about  
the mean, has certain coefficients of variation, or has certain *tail behav-*  
*ior* \(the characteristics of the demand distribution for extreme values  
of demand\). Thus, parametric methods can suffer in terms of overall  
forecasting accuracy if the actual demand distribution deviates signifi-  
cantly from these assumptions \(called *specification errors*\). Because they  
are more widely used in RM, we focus on parametric methods in this  
chapter.  
**9.1.4.2 Levels of Aggregation**  
Forecasts can be made at different levels of aggregation as well, and  
how to aggregate data and forecasts is another important design decision.  
To give an example, airlines price their products by fare-basis codes  
with a large number of fares-basis codes sold within each booking class.  
Capacity control, however, is usually performed at the booking-class  
level. How, then, should forecasting be handled? Should the demand  
be forecast for each fare product \(basis code\) or each booking class?  
That is, should we aggregate all the fare products in a booking class  
and forecast at the level of the booking class? Or should we forecast at  
the fare-product level and aggregate these forecasts into a forecast for  
booking-class demand?  
Another level-of-aggregation design decision comes up in network RM  
\(Chapter 3\), where the optimization system requires a forecast of de-  
mand for each multiresource product in the network. In principle, the  
forecasts should be at the level of the network products \(O&Ds or lengths  
of stay\) as this is the level required by network-optimization models.  
However, many reservation systems do not collect data at this level of  
detail. In the airline case, for example, reliable data may exist only  
for individual flight legs, and we may have to heuristically disaggregate  
leg-level forecasts into O&D, product-level forecasts.  
Ultimately, however, we need to produce the forecasts required by the  
optimization module. Continuing the airline example, this would imply  
generating forecasts at the fare-product level if we were using a bid-price  
control, but perhaps at the booking-class level if we were using a resource  
level, booking-class-based control. On the other hand, the requirements  
of the optimization module can often be manipulated. For example,  
one can simply forecast at the booking-class level and then assume that 418 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
all the demand in this booking class has the same \(say, the average\)  
fare. In the network case, the RM system might be using a simple  
single-resource heuristic to approximate the network RM problem, in  
which case an aggregate forecast for each resource independently may  
do just fine. Thus, the forecasting and optimization design decisions are  
intimately related. Indeed, in practice it is hard to change one without  
affecting the other.  
In retail RM as well, the level of aggregation in forecasting is largely  
governed by the data and optimization requirements. Store-level pricing  
requires store-level estimates of demand and price sensitivity for each  
product, whereas a model that optimizes prices set on a chainwide ba-  
sis may not require this same level of detail. If household purchase  
data \(panel data\) is available or if experiments or surveys can be con-  
ducted, then one can forecast based on models of individual purchase  
behavior and combine these to determine an aggregate demand function.  
However, if only aggregate POS sales data can be obtained, one has to  
estimate the aggregate demand function directly.  
**9.1.4.3 Bottom-Up versus Top-Down Strategies**  
Broadly speaking, there are two different strategies for aggregating  
forecasting. In a *bottom-up forecasting strategy,* forecasting is performed  
at a detailed level to generate *subforecasts.* The end forecast is then  
constructed by aggregating these detailed subforecasts. In a *top-down*  
*forecasting strategy,* forecasts are made at a high level of aggregation—a  
*superforecast*—and then the end forecast is constructed by disaggregat-  
ing these superforecasts down to the level of detail required. The follow-  
ing are examples of bottom-up and top-down forecasting strategies.  
**Example 9.1** \(BOTTOM-UP FORECASTING\) An airline is interested in getting fore-  
casts of load factors \(occupancy\) for each flight in each compartment for an upcoming  
season. The airline stores data of each past customer, itinerary, and fare class. This  
itinerary-level data is first used to make forecasts for the number of customers ex-  
pected to book for each itinerary and fare-class combination for every day of the  
season. Next, these detailed forecasts are added together to produce an aggregate  
forecast for the seasonal load-factors.  
**Example 9.2** \(TOP-DOWN FORECASTING\) A hotel is interested in a forecast of the  
number of people expected to book for each future date in each room-category and  
length-of-stay combination. The hotel first forecasts the total number of guests who  
will book to arrive on each day in each rate category \(the superforecast\). Then it  
forecasts the fraction of guests that stay for a specified length of time \(a length-of-stay  
distribution\). Finally, it combines these two components to arrive at an end forecast  
of expected number who will start their stay on a specific date and stay a certain  
number of days by multiplying the forecast for the aggregate number of guests on a  
specific date by the estimate of the fraction that will stay for a given length of time. *Estimation and Forecasting* 419  
Which strategy is most appropriate is not always clear-cut. It depends  
on the data that is available and accessible to an automated system on  
a daily basis, the outputs required, and the types of forecasts already  
being made and available for use. Moreover, the “right” answer in most  
cases is that *both* strategies are required because certain phenomena can  
be estimated only at a low level of aggregation, while others can be  
estimated only at a high level of aggregation.  
For example, it is clear that in an airline network if one wants an  
estimate of demand for each itinerary and fare-class combination, then  
aggregate booking-class or flight-leg data will not be sufficient; data for  
each passenger itinerary is required. At the same time, such passenger-  
level data is sparse, with often only a handful of bookings occurring for  
any given combination in a year. Hence, aggregate phenomena such as  
daily or weekly seasonalities, holiday effects, or upward or downward  
trends in total demand are—for all practical purposes—unobservable  
at the disaggregate level; one must look at aggregate booking data over  
many itinerary and fare-class combinations to observe such effects. Even  
with good passenger-level data, one may therefore need to aggregate  
data and perform aggregate forecasts to identify important “large-scale”  
phenomena. As a result, hybrid combinations of bottom-up and top-  
down approaches are the norm in practice.  
**9.2 Estimation Methods**  
Estimation is the problem of finding model parameters that best de-  
scribe a given set of observed data. Forecasting, in contrast, involves  
predicting future, unobserved values. Thus, estimation is generally *de-*  
*scriptive* \(characterizing what *has been* observed\), while forecasting is  
*predictive* \(characterizing what *will be* observed\). Roughly, in the RM  
context, estimation is the calibration of a forecasting model’s parameters  
\(hence it also is called *forecast calibration*\) and is done relatively infre-  
quently; while forecasting is the use of the estimated model to predict  
future values, and is performed frequently on an operational basis.  
For example, an estimate of price sensitivity based on past sales data  
may be used in a forecast of future demand. Similarly, many forecasting  
methods are based on estimating the parameters of a dynamic model  
from historical demand data, which is subsequently used to predict fu-  
ture values of demand. Yet this distinction between estimation and fore-  
casting is not always very sharp. In some methods, such as the Kalman  
filtering, estimation and forecasting work in lock-step, one after another.  
Here we examine methodology for parameter estimation and discuss  
some of the theoretical and practical issues that arise. 420 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**9.2.1 Estimators and Their Properties**  
An estimator represents, in essence, a formalized “guess” about the  
parameters of the underlying distribution from which a sample \(the ob-  
served data\) is assumed to be drawn. Estimators can take on many  
forms and can be based on different criteria for a “best” guess. We use  
demand estimation as our example, but the ideas apply more generally.  
**9.2.1.1 Nonparametric Estimators**  
Let the random variable denote the observation of demand,  
and let denote the distribution of Nonparamet-  
ric estimation methods do not make any assumptions on the underlying  
distribution *F*\(·\). For example, we could estimate by simply com-  
puting the fraction of observations in the sample that are less than or  
equal to for each value of This empirical distribution then forms a  
nonparametric estimate of the true distribution  
Nonparametric estimates of this type have the advantage of not re-  
quiring any assumptions on the form of the distribution. However, as  
mentioned earlier, they typically require more data to produce accurate  
estimates and do not allow one to extrapolate beyond the observed data  
easily. For example, if there were no observations less than 10 in a data  
set, then the empirical distribution would estimate that  
for all values of less than 10.  
**9.2.1.2 Parametric Estimators**  
For a parametric estimator, we assume that the underlying distribu-  
tion of is of the form  
where is a vector of *M* explanatory \(independent\)  
variables \(time, indicators of holiday events, prices, lagged observations  
of itself, and so on\) and is a M-dimensional vector  
of parameters. For ease of exposition, we assume that the dimension of  
and are the same, though this is not necessary.  
Assume we have a sequence of *N* independent observations  
with values for the explanatory vari-  
ables, alternatively represented by vectors or by a *N* × *M*  
matrix The estimation problem, then, is to  
determine the unknown parameters using only the sample of the *N* ob-  
servations \(the data\) and the values of the explanatory variables **Y**  
corresponding to each observation \(characteristics of the observed data\). *Estimation and Forecasting* 421  
It is usually convenient to express the relationship between the de-  
mand and the explanatory variables by a simple functional form con-  
sisting of a systematic \(deterministic\) component and an additive noise  
component\:1  
where the randomness comes from the error term Many of the re-  
gression and time-series forecasting models of this chapter can be viewed  
as manifestations of \(9.2\). The following is a common example of \(9.2\)\:  
**Example 9.3** \(LINEAR MODEL\) Consider the linear model of demand  
where are i.i.d. random variables, independent also of the explanatory  
variables **y**. *Z* is often referred to as the *dependent* variable and the vector **y** as the  
*independent* variables. The distribution of *Z* in terms of \(9.1\) is then  
where is the standard normal distribution.  
**9.2.1.3 Properties of Estimators**  
If the *N* observations, are considered independent  
realizations of then the estimator based on these  
observations is a function of *N* i.i.d. random variables, and is  
therefore itself a random variable. What properties would we like this  
\(random\) estimator to have?  
**Bias** For one, it would be desirable if the expected value of the estimator  
equaled the actual value of the parameters—that is, if  
If this property holds, the estimator is said to be an *unbiased estimator,*  
otherwise, it is a *biased estimator.* The estimator of the is said to have a *positive bias* if its expected value exceeds parameter,  
and  
a *negative bias* if its expected value is less than  
If the estimator is unbiased only for large samples of data—that is, it  
satisfies  
then it is called an *asymptotically unbiased estimator.* All unbiased es-  
timators are, of course, also asymptotically unbiased.  
1  
We drop the notation conditioning on and **y**, when it is obvious from the context. 422 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**Efficiency** An estimator is said to an *efficient estimator* if it is  
unbiased and the random variable has the smallest variance among  
all unbiased estimators. Efficiency is desirable because it implies the  
variability of the estimator is as low as possible given the available data.  
The Cramer-Rao bound2 provides a lower bound on the variance of  
*any* estimator, which can be used to prove an estimator is efficient. In  
particular, if an estimator achieves the Cramer-Rao bound, then we are  
guaranteed that it is efficient. An estimator can be inefficient for a finite  
sample but *asymptotically efficient* if it achieves the Cramer-Rao bound  
when the sample size is large.  
**Consistency** An estimator is said to be *consistent* if for any  
that is, if it converges in probability to the true value as the sample  
size increases. Consistency assures us that with sufficiently large samples  
of data, the value of can be estimated arbitrarily accurately.  
Ideally, we would like our estimators to be unbiased, efficient, and  
consistent, but this is not always possible. We revisit these properties  
in Section 9.5.1.2 on specification errors.  
**9.2.2 Minimum Square Error \(MSE\) and**  
# Regression Estimators  
One class of estimators is based on the *minimum mean-square error*  
\(MSE\) criterion—also referred to as *regression estimators.* MSE estima-  
tors are most naturally suited to the case where the forecast quantity  
has an additive noise term as in \(9.2\). Given a sequence of observa-  
tions and associated vectors of explanatory variable values  
the MSE estimate of the vector is the solution to  
where is as defined in \(9.2\). The minimization problem \(9.4\)  
can be solved using standard nonlinear optimization methods such as  
conjugate-gradient or quasi-Newton. However, the problem is greatly  
simplified if the function and the error terms have a specialized  
form, as shown next.  
**Ordinary Least-Squares \(OLS\) and Linear-Regression Estima-**  
**tors** If the function in \(9.1\), the error terms in \(9.2\), and explana-  
2See DeGroot \[151\], pp. 420–430 for a discussion of the Cramer-Rao bound. *Estimation and Forecasting* 423  
tory variables satisfy the assumptions listed in Table 9.1, the MSE  
estimates are also known as the *ordinary least-squares \(OLS\) estima-*  
*tors*—or *linear-regression estimators.* Specifically, suppose the observa-  
tions are linear functions of *M* explanatory variables of the form,  
Furthermore, suppose the explanatory variables are uncorrelated and  
the error term are independent, normal random variables that have  
means of zero and identical variances \(homoscedasticity\). Then the OLS  
estimators are the values that solve  
We can write equation \(9.2\) in matrix form as  
where and The MSE  
estimates for given *N* observations are then  
assuming the matrix is invertible.  
**Example 9.4** Consider the following model of demand\:  
This model has one scalar parameter which is constant over time, and is equivalent  
to having *M =* 1 and **Y** = \(1,...,1\) in \(9.5\). Assume is normally distributed with  
mean 0 and constant variance. Then if we have *N* observations, the MSE  
estimate based on this data solves  
Applying \(9.6\) and noting that and we obtain  
which is simply the sample mean of the data. 424 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT* *Estimation and Forecasting* 425  
From \(9.6\) it can be seen that the OLS estimator is a linear func-  
tion of the random observations **Z**, which makes computing the estimates  
quite easy. In addition, the OLS estimators have several desirable prop-  
erties\: they are consistent, unbiased, and efficient under very general  
conditions. For these reasons, the MSE/linear-regression estimator is  
popular in practice.  
Regression is widely used in price-based management for estimating  
price sensitivity, market shares, and the effects of various marketing  
variables \(such as displays and promotions\) on demand. Regression es-  
timates are somewhat less common in quantity-based RM forecasting  
application such as airline and hotel RM because in these applications it  
is often difficult to obtain data on the exogenous explanatory variables  
as an automated data feed. When regression is used in quantity-based  
RM, typically the only explanatory variables in the model are the his-  
torical demand data itself \(the explanatory variables are past demand  
observations\). However, in such cases formal time-series models of the  
type discussed in Section 9.3.2 are usually preferred.  
When any of the assumptions of the OLS regression in Table 9.1  
is violated, one has to resort to more advanced regression techniques  
such as *generalized least squares* \(GLS\), *seemingly unrelated regressions*  
\(SUR\), and two-stage and three-stage least squares \(2SLS, 3SLS\) \(see  
Greene \[220\]\). A description of these methods is beyond the scope of  
this chapter.  
**9.2.3 Maximum-Likelihood \(ML\) Estimators**  
While regression is based on the least-squares criterion, *maximum-*  
*likelihood \(ML\) estimators* are based on finding the parameters that  
maximize the “likelihood” of observing the sample data, where *likeli-*  
*hood* is defined as the probability of the observations occurring. More  
precisely, given a probability-density function of the process gener-  
ating which is a function of a vector of parameters  
and the observations of the explanatory variables, the likelihood of  
observing value as the observation is given by The  
likelihood of observing the N observations is then  
The ML estimation problem is to find a that maximizes the likelihood  
It is more convenient to maximize the log-likelihood, In because  
this converts the product of functions in \(9.8\) to a sum of functions.  
Since the log function is strictly increasing, maximizing the log-likelihood 426 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood. This gives the ML problem\:  
In special cases, this problem can be solved in closed form. Other-  
wise, if the function is a differentiable function, gradient-based  
optimization methods such as Newton’s method can be used to solve it  
numerically.  
ML estimators have good statistical properties under very general  
conditions; they can be shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal,  
and asymptotically efficient, achieving the Cramer-Rao lower bound on  
the variance of estimators for large sample sizes.  
**Example 9.5** \(ESTIMATING THE MEAN OF A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION\) Consider the  
following model of demand from Example 9.4\:  
Recall that the model assumes that the scalar parameter is normally distributed with mean 0 and constant variance observations, Then the ML estimator solves  
is constant over time, and  
Suppose we have *N*  
Taking the log of the objective function yields  
Differentiating with respect to ML estimator is  
and setting the result to zero, one can show that the  
which is just the sample mean. Note despite the fact that the estimation criterion is  
different, this estimator is the same as the MSE estimator of Example 9.4.  
**Example 9.6** \(ESTIMATING THE PARAMETERS OF MULTINOMIAL-LOGIT MODEL\) The  
MNL discrete-choice model is described in Section 7.2.2.3. The data consists of a set  
of *N* customers and their choices made from a finite set *S* of alternatives. Associated  
with each alternative is a vector of explanatory variables \(assume for simplicity  
there are no customer-specific characteristics\). The probability that a customer selects  
alternative is then given by \(assuming that all customers face the same choice-set  
of products\) *Estimation and Forecasting* 427  
where is a vector of \(unknown\) parameters. Let The likelihood function is then  
be the choice made by customer  
The maximum-likelihood estimate is then determined by solving  
While this maximum-likelihood problem cannot be solved in closed form, it has  
good computational properties. Namely, there are closed-form expressions for all first  
and second partial derivatives of the log-likelihood function, and it is jointly concave  
in most cases \(McFadden \[372\]; Hausman and McFadden \[244\]\). The ML estimator  
has also proved to be robust in practice. \(See Ben-Akiva and Lerman \[48\] for further  
discussion and case examples.\)  
**9.2.4 Method of Moments and Quantile**  
# Estimators  
While MSE and ML estimators are the most prevalent, several other  
estimators are also used in practice. Two common ones are the *method*  
*of moments* and *quantile estimators.*  
In the method of moments, one equates moments of the theoretical  
distribution to their equivalent empirical averages in the observed data.  
This yields a system of equations that can be solved to estimate the  
unknown parameters The following example illustrates the idea\:  
**Example 9.7** \(ESTIMATING THE PARAMETERS OF A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION\) Sup-  
pose we want to estimate the parameters of a normal distribution. The sample mean  
and sample second moment are computed as follows\:  
Equating these to the theoretical mean and second moment yields the system of  
equations  
Solving for and gives the estimates and  
Alternatively, we can use quantile estimates based on the empirical  
distribution to estimate the parameters of a distribution. For example, 428 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
we might estimate the mean of a normal distribution by noting that as  
the normal distribution is symmetric, the mean and median are the  
same. Hence, we can estimate the mean by computing the median of a  
sequence of *N* observations. More generally, one can compute a number  
of quantiles of a data set and equate these to the theoretical quantiles  
of the parametric distribution. In general, if parameters need to  
estimated, different quantiles are needed to produce equations in  
unknowns \(for a normal distribution, for example, one could equate  
the 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles of the data to the theoretical values to get two  
equations for the mean and variance\). Quantile estimation techniques  
are sometimes preferred, as they tend to be less sensitive to outlier data  
than are MSE and ML estimators.  
**9.2.5 Endogeneity, Heterogeneity, and**  
# Competition  
Table 9.1 lists the standard problems associated with classical  
regression—correlation of the error terms, collinearity, and so on—and  
techniques for dealing with violations of the assumptions. Such prob-  
lems and their corrective measures are well known and can be found in  
many standard econometric books. In this section, we focus on a few  
nonstandard estimation problems that are of particular importance for  
RM applications—endogeneity, heterogeneity, and competition.  
**9.2.5.1 Endogeneity**  
The model \(9.2\) is said to suffer from endogeneity if the error term is  
correlated with one of the explanatory variables in **y**. This is a common  
problem in RM practice, both in aggregate-demand function estimation  
and in disaggregate, discrete-choice model estimation.  
For example, products may have some unobservable or unmeasurable  
features—quality, style, reputation—and the selling firm typically prices  
its products accordingly. So if there are two firms in the market with  
similar products and one has higher nonquantifiable quality, we may  
observe that the firm with the higher-quality product has both a larger  
market share and a higher price. A naive estimation based on market  
shares that ignores the unobserved quality characteristics would lead  
to the odd conclusions that higher price leads to higher market share!  
Such effects are widespread in price-elasticity estimation because we can  
rarely observe all relevant product and firm characteristics and price is  
usually correlated with many of these unobservable characteristics.  
Econometricians call this problem *endogeneity* or *simultaneity.* The  
technical definition is that the random-error term in \(9.2\) is correlated *Estimation and Forecasting* 429  
with one of the explanatory variables, or equivalently \(in  
the case of linear regression\) these vectors are not orthogonal. So while  
is supposed to represent all unobservable customer and product char-  
acteristics that influence demand for a given set of explanatory variables  
\(*Z*|**y**\), some of the explanatory variables **y** also contain information on  
the unobservable attributes through their correlation with  
Econometric techniques to correct endogeneity fall under a class of  
methods called *instrumental-variables \(IV\) techniques,* attributed to  
Reiersøl \[438\] and Geary \[202\]. Two-stage and three-stage least-squares  
methods \(2SLS and 3SLS\) are some of the popular IV techniques. In-  
strumental variables are exogenous variables that are correlated with an  
explanatory variable but are uncorrelated with the error term If there  
are such IVs, we can use them to “remove” the problematic correlation  
between the independent variables **y** and  
We illustrate the idea for the case of linear regression. In \(9.5\) suppose  
However, suppose there exist *M* instrumental variables \(we can use some  
of the to construct this vector of IVs\) for each observation so that  
we have a *N × M* matrix **V** with the property that and  
is nonsingular. Then the IV estimator is  
where The IV estimator is a consistent estimator of  
which can be shown by substituting in \(9.12\)\:  
For a given set of *N* observations can be calculated by the sample average  
the IV estimator  
which converges by the weak law of large numbers to w.p.1 as  
and w.p.1.  
A regression with an IV transformation is called an *IV regression*  
\(see Greene \[220\] and Woolrdige \[581\] for details and examples of IV  
methods\) and a *generalized IV regression* if we use more than *M* IV  
variables. There are no mechanically generated IVs that work for all  
cases. It often requires considerable ingenuity to find good IVs and to 430 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
argue that they can in fact serve to correct for endogeneity. This is what  
makes the technique rather difficult to apply, requiring the skills of an  
experienced econometrician.  
In nonlinear problems, IV techniques become more difficult to apply.  
For example, one often encounters endogeneity when estimating discrete-  
choice demand models such as the MNL model from aggregate data  
\(prices correlated with unobservable product characteristics\). However,  
the problem is hard to correct because the aggregate demand is a nonlin-  
ear function of the utilities of each product and the endogeneity is present  
in the equation for the utilities. So using any IV technique for correcting  
for endogeneity becomes computationally challenging, as pointed out by  
Berry \[53\]. Berry \[53\] and Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes \[52\] recommend  
that for the case of discrete-choice models in an oligopoly setting, one  
use measures of the firm’s costs and the attributes of the products of the  
other firms as IVs. See also Besanko, Gupta, and Jain \[63\] for estimating  
a logit model in the presence of endogeneity due to competition.  
**9.2.5.2 Heterogeneity**  
Customer heterogeneity is important to understand in RM. In Sec-  
tion 7.2.3 we examined a few models of heterogeneity—namely, the finite-  
mixture logit model and the random-coefficients discrete-choice model.  
Here, we discuss how to estimate these models.  
Estimation of the finite-mixture logit model is relatively straightfor-  
ward. First, we must determine the number of segments. If there is no  
*a priori* knowledge of the number, we iterate the estimation procedure,  
increasing or decreasing the number of segments in each round, using  
suitable model-selection criteria \(see Section 9.5.1\) to decide on the op-  
timal number of segments. For a given number of segments *L*, we find  
the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood function. For the finite-  
mixture logit model of Section 7.2.3.1, this would amount to maximizing  
the following likelihood function based on the purchase histories of *N*  
customers\:  
where is the choice made by customer The only difficulty, from  
an optimization point of view, is that taking logs on both sides does not  
convert the right-hand side into a sum of terms, so the maximization is  
somewhat more challenging than the estimation of standard logit models.  
Estimation of the random-coefficient logit, likewise, uses maximum-  
likelihood estimation and is more difficult in general than the standard  
multinomial logit. Consider the model given in Section 7.2.3.2. Assum- *Estimation and Forecasting* 431  
ing the parameters follow a normal distribution, the likelihood function  
that needs to be maximized is given by  
where is the *M*-dimensional joint normal p.d.f. \(with an identity covari-  
ance matrix if the taste parameters are independent\). If the distributions  
of the parameters are modeled as a joint normal distribution with a  
general covariance matrix structure, then evaluation of the integral is  
quite difficult in practice. However, the extreme value distribution has  
been integrated out in \(9.13\), and we do end up with a logit-like term  
inside the integrals.  
One of the problems dealing with unobservable heterogeneity in the  
population is that we often have to assume a distribution of hetero-  
geneity without having much evidence as to its specification. Many  
times, a distribution is chosen for analytical or computational conve-  
nience. Unfortunately, a situation can arise where two radically differ-  
ent distributions of heterogeneity equally support the aggregate demand  
observations. This was pointed out by Heckman and Singer \[248\], who  
illustrated this overparameterization with the following example\:  
**Example 9.8** Consider an aggregate-demand function based on a heterogeneity pa-  
rameter The variance on the distribution of represents the degree of heterogeneity.  
Let the demand for a particular value of be given by the distribution  
and let be equal to a constant with probability 1 \(essentiallysaying the population  
is homogeneous\). The aggregate-demand distribution then is  
Consider another possible specification where  
and the distribution of given by This also turns out to lead to an aggregate-  
demand distribution given by So based only on aggregate demand data, it  
is impossible to identify which specification is correct.  
Therefore, one should proceed with caution when inferring a func-  
tional form for unobserved heterogeneity from aggregate data.  
Nonparametric methods avoid the problem of having to specify a dis-  
tribution, and Jain, Vilcassim, and Chintagunta \[267\] follow this strat-  
egy. Assume that the coefficients of the MNL model in \(9.10\) are  
randomly drawn from a discrete multivariate probability distribution  
That is, the customer is assumed to make his choice us-  
ing whose components are drawn from *G*\(·\) is considered 432 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
a discrete distribution with support vectors They estimate  
the number of support vectors *L,* the location of the support vectors,  
and the probability mass associated with the support vector from  
observed data.  
**9.2.5.3 Competition**  
If one has access to information on prices and demand for an en-  
tire market \(such as MIDT data for airlines and scanner-panel data  
sold by marketing research firms\), it is possible to separately estimate  
competitive- and own-price effects. A common strategy in such cases is  
to assume a model of competition between the firms, derive the equilib-  
rium conditions implied by this model, and then estimate the parameters  
subject to these equilibrium conditions. We illustrate this approach with  
an example\:  
**Example 9.9** Assume a homogeneous population of customers who choose among  
products according to the MNL choice rule. Then the theoretical share of product  
is given as in Section 7.2.2.3,  
where price is one of the explanatory variables in One way to estimate the  
parameters is by equating the observed market share to the theoretical prediction  
of equilibrium. It is convenient to take logs in doing this, which yields the following  
system of equations relating market shares to choice behavior\:  
Next assume that prices are formed by a Bertrand-style competition in prices \(see  
Section 8.4.1.4\). Let be the constant marginal cost of production for product  
The profit function for product is given by  
where *N* is the size of the population. Let Differentiating \(9.16\) with respect to equilibrium conditions,  
be the coefficient of price in \(9.14\).  
and setting it to zero, we get the first-order  
The vector of parameters is then estimated by attempting to fit a solution to  
\(9.15\) and \(9.17\) simultaneously. This can be done using, say, nonlinear least-squares  
estimation. *Estimation and Forecasting*  
433  
**9.3 Forecasting Methods**  
We next turn to forecasting methods, which explicitly attempt to  
“predict” the future values of a sequence of data. For RM, we are mostly  
interested in forecasting demand \(demand to come, as well as aggregate  
demand for the resource and at various levels of aggregation\), though in  
many cases one also needs to forecast quantities such as market prices,  
length of stay \(in hotel RM\), cancellation and no-show rates, and so  
on. Indeed, the methods presented here, by and large, apply to a wide  
variety of forecasting tasks, though for purposes of illustration we focus  
on demand forecasting as our canonical application.  
Forecasting is a vast topic, spanning a diverse range of fields includ-  
ing statistics, computer science, engineering, and economics. Over the  
years, a core set of forecasting methods have been developed and new  
improvements continue despite the maturity of the field. Some of these  
forecasting methods are based on rigorous mathematical and statistical  
foundations, while others are largely heuristic in nature.  
Yet despite this long history and vast body of research on forecast-  
ing, there are few published reports that document the performance of  
various forecasting methods in RM applications. Presentations on fore-  
casting by practitioners at industry conferences often suffer from the  
proprietary nature of the material, with key details either omitted or  
disguised. The same can be said of most presentations by RM system  
vendors. Nevertheless, one can still glean some useful insights into cur-  
rent practice from these sources.  
For one, most forecasting algorithms in RM practice are variations of  
standard methods, and most are not particularly complicated or math-  
ematically sophisticated. Also, many vendors use multiple algorithms,  
which allow users the option of choosing one or more methods, or, alter-  
natively, the system may combine the forecasts from the various methods  
itself \(see Section 9.3.11\). Finally, the majority of forecasting effort in  
practice is directed at data-related tasks—collection, preprocessing and  
cleansing—rather than on forecasting methodology per se.  
In terms of forecasting methods, the emphasis in RM systems is on  
speed, simplicity, and robustness, as a large number of forecasts have to  
be made and the time available for making them is limited. For example,  
if an airline has 50,000 itineraries in 10 fare classes that it reforecasts 40  
times during a sales period \(typical numbers for a medium-size airline\),  
then they must forecast nearly *2 million* demand quantities every day!  
And this does not include forecasts of important auxiliary quantities  
such as cancellation and no-show rates. It is little wonder, then, that  
fast, simple methods are preferred in RM systems. 434 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Forecasting is normally performed overnight in a batch process and  
then fed to the optimization modules, so the time window for completing  
all control operations ranges from six to eight hours at most. Forecasting  
model calibration \(estimation\), in turn, can only be done off line and  
infrequently.  
Robustness of the forecasts is also important in practice for these  
same reasons. If a large number of forecasts are off widely and the  
system starts generating exceptions, analysts may be overwhelmed by  
the amount of manual intervention required. Hence, performance—in  
terms of forecast accuracy under “normal” data conditions—while al-  
ways a desirable criteria, has to be balanced against these “real world”  
speed constraints and robustness considerations. We next provide an  
overview of RM forecasting algorithms, starting with ad hoc and time-  
series methods and progressing to Bayesian, state-space \(Kalman filter\),  
and machine-learning \(neural network\) methods.  
**9.3.1 Ad-Hoc Forecasting Methods**  
The first-class of methods we look at are known as ad-hoc forecasting  
methods because their reasoning is largely heuristic in nature. The term  
*ad hoc* is somewhat misleading, however, as many of these methods turn  
out to have good theoretical properties despite their heuristic origins.  
They are also sometimes referred to as *structural* forecasting methods  
because they proceed by assuming a compositional structure on the data,  
breaking up and composing the series into hypothesized patterns \(see  
Figure 9.3\). These include the following three types of components\:  
**Level** The typical or “average” value of the data, though in ad-hoc  
methods the level is not defined as a statistical average in any formal  
sense.  
**Trend** A predictable increase or decrease in the data values over  
time. Most often these are modeled as linear increases or decreases,  
but other functions may be used.  
**Seasonality** A periodic or repeating pattern in the data values over  
time—for example, as produced by day-of-week or time-of-year ef-  
fects.  
Ad-hoc forecasting methods are intuitive, are simple to program, and  
maintain and perform well in practice. For these reasons, they are preva-  
lent in RM practice.  
A common strategy of ad-hoc forecasting methods is to try to  
“smooth” the data or average-out the noise components to estimate the  
level, trend, and seasonality components in the data. These estimates of *Estimation and Forecasting* 435  
the smoothed series are then used to forecast future values, as we show  
next.  
**9.3.1.1 *M*-Period Moving Average**  
Let represent the current time, and suppose we want to forecast  
values at time in the future, called the *ahead forecast.*  
Let denote the observed demand data, and  
denote the forecasts. To forecast one period ahead, one simple approach  
is to use the average of the past *M* observations. That is, the forecast  
for period is given by  
called the *simple M-period moving-average forecast. M* is called the *span*  
of the moving average. The formula for the ahead forecast is  
given by 436 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
A different way of writing \(9.18\) is  
which is computationally faster. If is less than *M* \(that is, in the initial  
stages of forecasting\), one can use  
The moving-average method is very simple and fast, but its motivation  
is largely heuristic. The idea is simply that the most recent observations  
serve as better predictors for the future than do older data. Therefore,  
instead of taking the forecast as the average of *all* the data, we average  
only the *M* most recent data observations.  
The moving-average forecast responds more quickly to underlying  
shifts in the demand process if the span *M* is small, but a small span  
results in a more volatile forecast \(one that is more sensitive to noise  
in the data\). In practice, *M* may range from 3 to 15, but the value  
depends heavily on the data characteristics and the units used for the  
time intervals.  
When the data exhibits an upward or downward trend, the moving  
average method will systematically under forecast or overforecast. To  
handle such cases, variations such as double or triple moving average  
have been developed, but for such data one of the exponential smoothing  
methods given next is usually preferred.  
**9.3.1.2 Exponential Smoothing**  
Exponential-smoothing methods are among the most popular fore-  
casting methods used in RM practice because they are simple and robust  
and generally have good forecast accuracy. We look at three variations of  
exponential smoothing. First, however, we formally define the following  
component estimates of the forecast\:  
= the estimate of the level \(average\) for period  
= the estimate of the trend for period and  
= the estimate of the seasonality factor for period  
See Figure 9.3 for an illustration of these components.  
**Simple Exponential Smoothing** This simplest version of exponen-  
tial smoothing is defined by a single parameter, called the  
*smoothing constant for the level.* The forecast for time-period is  
given by  
The ahead forecast is then simply *Estimation and Forecasting* 437  
The choice of is a design decision and is usually calibrated prior to  
starting the forecasting system. Smaller values of smooth the fore-  
casts more, leading to more stability, while larger values of make the  
forecast more responsive to recent changes in level but also more sus-  
ceptible to noise. In practice, is typically set between 0.05 and 0.3  
in RM applications. In addition, more advanced adaptive variations of  
the smoothing methods attempt to automatically optimize the value of  
based on its observed performance.  
Some motivation for the exponential smoothing method can be ob-  
tained by expanding the recursive formula \(9.19\), substituting repeat-  
edly for  
Thus, we see the forecast for period is a weighted combination  
of all previous observations with the weights “exponentially” decreasing  
at a rate of High values of make the decrease rapid, and the  
forecasts will be more responsive to recent observations, while low values  
of will spread the weights over a longer period, and the forecasts will  
react more slowly to changes in demand. Figure 9.4 illustrates the role  
of the smoothing parameter on a sample time series of data.  
The smoothing parameters play a similar \(albeit more complicated\)  
role in the next two models. 438 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**Exponential Smoothing with Linear Trend** Let and  
be two parameters representing the smoothing factors for  
the underlying level and trend, respectively. Then the forecast for time-  
period is given by the following formulas\:  
The ahead forecast is given by  
Note is the estimate of the trend factor in each period and is smoothed  
using  
# Exponential Smoothing with Trend and Seasonality \(Holt-  
**Winter’s Method\)** This method is applicable to data series that ex-  
hibit seasonal variations \(for example, monthly, quarterly, or half-yearly  
variations\). Let and be three para-  
meters used to control the smoothing on the underlying level, trend,  
and seasonality, respectively. Let *L* represent the periodicity of the  
seasonality—that is, the number of periods after which the seasons re-  
peat. *L* depends on the length of the periods and the seasonality—for  
instance, if we are constructing quarterly forecasts and the seasonality  
is by quarter, *L =* 4, or if we are constructing monthly forecasts and the  
seasonality is by month, *L =* 12\. Then the forecast for time-period  
is given by the formula,  
and the three components of this forecast are updated as follows\:  
In \(9.23c\), is the new estimate of the seasonality factor for period  
These factors are updated once each season and are smoothed with the  
previous estimate of the seasonality factor, of *L* periods in the past, using  
Equation \(9.23a\) “deseasonalizes” the data by replacing by  
and then updates this deseasonalized data using the same procedure as  
in exponential smoothing with a linear trend. *Estimation and Forecasting* 439  
The deseasonalized forecast is “reseasonalized” in \(9.22\) by multiply-  
ing by the estimated seasonality factor to generate the forecast  
More than one seasonal factor can be incorporated into the model  
\(such as both a day-of-week factor and a monthly factor\) by simply keep-  
ing two multiplicative seasonal factors and updating them as in \(9.23a\)  
and \(9.23c\).  
**9.3.2 Time-Series Forecasting Methods**  
In contrast to ad-hoc forecasting methods, time-series methods are  
based on well-specified classes of models that describe the underlying  
time series of data. These models have relatively simple mathematical  
structures, yet the model classes are rich enough to represent a wide  
range of data characteristics. Since the models are well specified, it  
is possible to derive “optimal” \(MSE or ML\) forecasting methods for  
each one. In this way, the forecasting procedure is specifically tailored  
to the underlying data-generation model. This formal representation of  
the dynamics governing the time series and the rigorous development of  
optimal forecasting methods is what distinguishes time-series methods.  
The collection of random variables is called a *time series* if it  
represents successive observations taken over time. The values are  
assumed to be generated by a dynamic system, which may depend on  
past values for and a series of random disturbances At time  
we have observations of the past data values and would like  
to forecast the future values of the time series—for example, forecasting  
the value units in the future, or We might be interested in a  
single point estimate, of this future value or an estimate of  
the parameters of its distribution.  
A time-series forecasting process proceeds in two basic steps. First,  
we make a hypothesis about the specific type of process generating the  
time series of data. Various model-identification techniques can be em-  
ployed to help determine which models best fit the data. Once the  
model is identified, we estimate its parameters. Finally, we apply the  
corresponding optimal forecasting method specific to that model.  
One distinct advantage of time-series methods is that they explicitly  
model the correlations between successive data points and exploit any  
dependence to make better forecasts. However, it is up to the RM sys-  
tem designer to decide if such correlations exist \(for example, whether  
there are “runs” in the data, where high-demand observations are often  
followed by other high-demand observations\). Moreover, even when cor-  
relation exists, the designer must decide if it is worth building in this  
extra complexity to obtain better forecasts because these models require 440 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
relatively large samples of data \(usually at least 50 observations\) to cal-  
ibrate accurately.  
In what follows, we present several time-series models and methods  
for forecasting and updating estimates of their parameters. But first,  
we introduce two important concepts central to time-series forecasting\:  
stationarity and autocorrelation.  
**9.3.2.1 Stationary Time Series**  
Stationarity is an important property of a time series that greatly  
simplifies the forecasting task. Simply put, a time series is stationary  
if its statistical properties do not change over time. More formally, if  
and are two sets of random variables  
from the series, then the series is said to be *stationary* if the joint distri-  
bution of these two sets of variables is the same for all choices of time  
and all pairs of values and  
To understand why the stationarity assumption simplifies forecast-  
ing, consider the problem of estimating the first two moments \(means,  
variances, and covariances\) of a collection of *N* random variables from  
a nonstationary time series. Nonstationarity means that these *N* ob-  
servations were generated by a random process whose joint distribution  
could be different at each time. Therefore, to estimate the first and sec-  
ond moments, we need to estimate *N* expected values, *N* variances, and  
*N*\(*N –* 1\)/2 covariances—a total of parameters. However,  
if the series is stationary, all the expected values and variances will be the  
same, as and have the same marginal distribution. Moreover,  
there are only *N –* 1 distinct covariances because the joint distribution  
of and is the same as that of and \(for all and  
\), and hence their respective covariances are the same. Therefore, the  
number of parameters we need to estimate if the series is stationary is  
only 2 *+* \(*N –* 1\), a much more manageable task. To simplify things even  
further, one often makes further structural assumptions that guarantee  
that a large number of the covariances are identically zero, making the  
estimation problem even simpler.  
How serious is the assumption of stationarity? At first glance, it seems  
quite restrictive. In fact, many time series encountered in practice are  
clearly nonstationary. For example, any time-series data with a trend  
or seasonal pattern is not stationary \(if the series shows an increasing  
trend, the underlying distributions of the successive random variables  
are certainly not identical\). However, even if the time series itself is not  
stationary, transformations of the series—such as the difference between  
successive values—may be stationary. Indeed, time-series forecasting  
methods for nonstationary data typically involve transforming the data *Estimation and Forecasting* 441  
to obtain related stationary series; forecasts based on this transformed  
stationary series are then used construct a forecast for the original time  
series.  
**9.3.2.2 Autocorrelation**  
As we show below, entire classes of stationary time-series methods  
are specified through their covariance structure over time—that is, the  
covariance of and for all The autocorrelation function \(ACF\)  
and partial autocorrelation function \(PACF\) are the key tools to analyze  
this covariance structure. They serve as “signatures”, as it were, of a  
time-series model, and by comparing these signatures to the “sample”  
signatures obtained from our data we can determine which models are  
most appropriate.  
Specifically, the *autocovariance* function is defined as the covari-  
ance between and  
The autocovariance function measures the dispersion or variance of the  
process. However, two data series that are identical except for the scale  
of measurement will have different autocovariance functions. Therefore,  
it is better to deal with the *autocorrelation* function, defined as the  
autocovariance function divided by the variance  
which is scale invariant.  
Given a data series the *sample autocovariance* function  
is given by  
where is the sample mean  
The *sample autocorrelation function* is given by  
The partial autocorrelation function \(PACF\) is defined as 442 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and can be shown to be equal to the ratio of two determinants involv-  
ing the autocorrelations \(see Wei \[560\], pp.15–22\). A sample PACF can  
be defined analogous to the sample ACF, but it is considerably more  
complex to compute. However, most statistical packages automatically  
compute and plot the sample ACFs and PACFs, so the complexity of  
the calculations is not a major concern. An example of a sample auto-  
correlation function and a partial autocorrelation function is shown in  
Figure 9.5.  
**9.3.3 Stationary Time-Series Models**  
We first consider stationary time-series models. To begin, define a  
*linear filter* as a stochastic process that can be written as an infinite  
weighted sum of random variables as follows\:  
\(the minus sign on the is by convention\), where and are constant  
parameters and the random variables \(called *white-noise disturbances*\)  
are assumed to be i.i.d. normally-distributed random variables with a  
mean of 0 and standard deviation for all The stochastic process  
is therefore a stationary process. We define to be the level of the  
series, which is assumed to be constant. If the sequence is  
finite or is infinite and convergent, then one can show that the process  
is stationary and is the mean of the series  
We can rewrite equation \(9.24\) to express in terms of  
and as follows\:  
First, eliminate from \(9.24\), and write remaining variables and parameters,  
in terms of the  
Substitute \(9.26\) in \(9.25\) to obtain  
Repeat this process to eliminate and so on to obtain an  
equation where is expressed solely in terms of and *Estimation and Forecasting* 443 444 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where and  
and are a new set of constants that depend on  
The random variable can represent either a stationary or nonsta-  
tionary process depending on the properties of the parameters \(equiv-  
alently, Three important stationary time-series models arise from  
using \(9.24\) and \(9.28\)\:  
**Moving average process** a finite number of is given by  
This process requires that only  
be nonzero in \(9.24\). A order MA process  
**Autoregressive process** a finite number of This process requires that only  
be nonzero in \(9.28\)\:  
**Autoregressive moving average process** This  
process is a combination of MA and AR process  
An AR process is stationary if the roots of the polynomial  
are greater than one. An MA process is called *invertible* if  
all the roots of the polynomial are greater than  
one. One can show that a finite-order stationary AR process can be  
expressed as an infinite-order MA process, and conversely, a finite-order  
invertible MA process can be written as an infinite-order AR process.  
This relationship is useful because if a fitted AR model contains a large  
number of parameters, it is possible that the corresponding MA model  
will have fewer parameters, and vice versa. An ARMA model, being  
a combination of an AR and an MA process can, in principle, reduce  
the number of parameters even further. Every model has  
what is called a *pure MA representation*—that is, it can be written as  
the following infinite sum \(see Wei \[560\], p.58 for a derivation\)\:  
In most practical applications of these models, and rarely ex-  
ceed 2. The means and covariances for ARMA series with small values  
of and are given in Table 9.2. Recall denotes the covariance *Estimation and Forecasting* 445  
Note that for stationary processes, the covari-  
ances are independent of with representing the variance. In some  
cases \(as for AR\(2\)\), the covariances do not have a closed-form formula  
but can be derived as solutions to a set of equations \(see Wei \[560\]  
for derivations\). The AR and MA processes have distinctive ACF and  
PACFs. Figure 9.6 shows some typical theoretical ACF and PACFs.  
The forms of these ACF and PACFs provide important clues as to  
which model is most appropriate for the observed data. Such model-  
identification issues are discussed in Section 9.3.5.  
Once we decide that a set of time-series data is an or an  
process, we can proceed to identify the parameters of the model by using  
ML or MSE criteria. We can then use the models for forecasting in a  
relatively straightforward manner, as shown in the following example.  
**Example 9.10** We illustrate the forecasting process on the following data set  
Assume the data comes from an AR\(2\) process,  
The forecasting process proceeds as follows\: 446 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**Parameter estimation** We first estimate the parameters and in \(9.32\) by  
MSE estimation. This we do by solving the following optimization problem \(note  
that an AR\(2\) process requires at least two initial points, so we begin with data *Estimation and Forecasting* 447  
point 3\)\:3  
Let and denote the parameters that minimize the mean-square error  
on these data. For an AR\(2\) process, \(9.33\) has a closed-form solution, but in  
general numerical optimization is required to find the minimum. \(Most statistical  
software packages solve this optimization problem automatically.\) The parameters  
that minimize the mean-square error for the data set \(9.10\) turn out to be  
and  
**Forecast** For an AR\(2\) process, the one-step forecast depends on the two previous  
observations. In general, the forecasts for are then  
given by \(assume  
The results of the forecast are given in Table 9.3.  
**9.3.4 Nonstationary Time-Series Models**  
As mentioned, most time-series data encountered in practice are non-  
stationary. In such cases, stationary time-series models may not fit the  
data well and can produce poor forecasts. Techniques to deal with non-  
stationary data try to make the data stationary by a suitable transfor-  
mation, so that one can then apply a stationary time-series model to  
the transformed data. The resulting stationary forecasts are then trans-  
formed back to their original nonstationary form. Differencing successive  
points in the time series is one such technique.  
Time series that are stationary after successive differencing are called  
*homogenous* nonstationary series. This means that after differencing  
the series is adequately represented by an ARMA model of the form  
\(9.31\). Other transformations, such as taking the logarithm of the series,  
can make a series stationary if the relative or percentage changes are  
stationary rather than the differences. For ease of exposition, however,  
we focus only on differencing in this section.  
Given a time series define a new time series as  
is called the first-difference of the series. As we mentioned, there  
is often good reason to suspect that even if is not stationary, might  
be. A series with a linear trend, for instance, has constant differences and  
3Solving the minimization problem \(9.33\) could be computationally quite intensive, espe-  
cially if it has to be re-solved after each observation. A practical alternative is to estimate  
parameters only periodically—say, after every 50 observations. 448 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
its first-difference series would be stationary. If we can construct a new series that is the differences of still is not stationary,  
and examine  
if it is stationary, and so on.  
An *autoregressive integrated moving-average process,*  
is one whose differenced series is an case of ARMA models, the parameters process. As for the  
are usually small \(less than  
or equal to 2\) in real-world forecasting models.  
How do we decide how many differences to take or whether to differ-  
ence at all? The ACF is helpful in this regard. If the series is nonsta-  
tionary, the sample ACF shows high values for many periods, whereas  
if the series is stationary, it damps down to zero quickly, often within  
four or five periods. We can then difference the data and analyze the  
resulting ACF to see if the results indicate stationarity. If not, then  
more differencing may be needed.  
The model is designed for homogeneous, nonstation-  
ary time series. For example, when there is a trend \(linear or nonlinear\),  
then successive differencing of ARIMA converts the series to a station- *Estimation and Forecasting* 449  
ary series. If, however, the data has a seasonal pattern in addition to  
a trend, a more involved procedure is required. One option is to con-  
sider the series as a product of two stationary series—one that represents  
the seasonal component and another that represents a stationary time  
series. We can then difference the seasonal component by the period  
of seasonality, and the other component can be treated as a stationary  
time series. However, model identification, parameter estimation, and  
forecasting are considerably more complicated for this sort of model and  
are beyond the scope of this chapter.  
Finally, we note there is a heuristic relationship between ARIMA  
process and the simple exponential smoothing method \(9.3.1.2\). To see  
this, consider the following ARIMA\(0,1,1\) series\:  
and  
Substituting successively for we obtain  
in the form \(9.36\) into \(9.35\),  
Note the similarity with the simple exponential smoothing  
method \(9.20\), where Box and Jenkins \[85\] and Har-  
vey \[243\] derive many connections like this between ad-hoc models and  
ARIMA models.  
**9.3.5 Box-Jenkins Identification Process**  
Determining the model that best represents a given time series is more  
of an art than a science. Often many different models must be tried  
before one can narrow down the choice of a “best” model. However,  
the Box-Jenkins method provides a framework to formalize the model-  
selection process. It recommends an iterative methodology of choosing  
the model, validating it, and modifying it to identify the best possible  
time-series model. Here, we briefly review this methodology.  
The first step in the process is *identification.* In this step, the sample  
ACF and PACF functions are plotted to tentatively identify the most  
likely candidate for a model. These correlograms are then compared  
with the correlograms of a standard process such as or  
for small values of and For instance, if the sample  
ACF stops after spikes, an model would be appropriate; if the 450 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
sample PACF stops after spikes, an model would be appropriate;  
if neither looks like the right model but the correlograms still decline  
exponentially toward zero, an ARMA model would be more suitable.  
The next step is an *estimation* step in which the model parameters are  
estimated from the data. Usually, these are least-squares or maximum-  
likelihood estimates.  
The final step is the *diagnostic* step, which verifies that the chosen  
model and parameters indeed fit the data well. We do this by taking  
the ACF of the residual series \(actual data values subtracted from the  
model prediction data\) and performing various statistical tests \(such  
as the Box-Pierce test\) to see if it represents white noise. If the model  
performs poorly on these tests, the model is rejected, and another model  
is tested.  
Once the model has been selected, we can then use it to generate  
forecasts as illustrated in Example 9.10. In practice, once a system is  
operational, the model itself is rarely altered. In contrast, nonparamet-  
ric or semiparametric methods, such as neural-network methods, adapt  
the model automatically based on recently observed data. Indeed, the  
substantial amount of manual work and statistical skills required to im-  
plement the Box-Jenkins methodology are its main disadvantages in  
practice, especially in a RM context where one needs a highly auto-  
mated forecasting system with minimum manual intervention. As a  
result, time-series methods have not found much favor in current RM  
practice. But their performance, when sufficiently tuned and calibrated,  
can be significantly better than the simpler ad-hoc forecasting methods  
of Section 9.3.1. So even if they are not used operationally, time-series  
methods play an important role as reference methods when evaluating  
simpler forecasting methods.  
**9.3.6 Bayesian Forecasting Methods**  
Bayesian methods are a large class of forecasting methods that use  
the Bayes formula to merge a prior belief about forecast values with  
information obtained from observed data. The methods are especially  
useful when there is no historical data, a common occurrence when new  
products are introduced. For example, an airline may start flying on  
a new route and have no historical demand information on the route.  
Fashion apparel products often change every season, and hence demand  
may be unrelated to the historical sales of past products. Similarly, a TV  
broadcaster has no historical demand information on demand for a new  
series. Nevertheless, in each of these cases forecasters may have some  
subjective beliefs about demand, based on human judgment or alterna-  
tive data sources \(such as test marketing and focus groups\). Bayesian *Estimation and Forecasting* 451  
methods provide a rigorous and systematic way of specifying such prior  
beliefs and then updating them as demand data is observed. Hence,  
they make it possible to combine subjective knowledge with information  
obtained from data and observations.  
**9.3.6.1 Basic Bayesian Forecasting**  
As before, let be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables repre-  
senting a data-generation process. We assume has a density function  
that is a function of a single, unknown parameter For example,  
might have a Poisson distribution, and the parameter might be the  
mean Since is unknown, it too is assumed to be a random variable  
with a probability density This density, called the *prior,* represents  
our current belief about the value of the parameter Roughly, if we are  
confident about the value of then the density would be tightly  
concentrated \(have a low variance\); conversely, if we are very unsure  
about the value of then it would be more spread out \(have a higher  
variance\). A prior with a large variance is called a *diffuse* prior.  
When new data is observed, we may change our belief about the  
parameter The procedure for formalizing this updating is given by  
Bayes rule. Let represent our initial prior distribution  
and denote our first observation. Then after observing demand, our  
*posterior distribution* of is given by  
The Bayes estimator of is then the expected value of based on the  
posterior distribution \(that is, once the information from the observed  
demand had been incorporated\)\:  
The estimator has several nice theoretical properties. In particular,  
one can show that it minimizes the variance of the forecast error.  
The value is used in forecasting by setting Once  
the next data value is observed, we repeat the procedure to get  
and so on. Thus, represents our current \(time belief about  
\(Note that it is a function of the history of observations,  
What makes Bayes estimation practical is that for certain prior dis-  
tributions of the parameters and certain corresponding sample dis-  
tributions of the random variable *Z,* the posterior distributions of the  
parameters in \(9.37\) have the same distributional form as the prior, and  
their parameters are given by closed-form updating formulas. A pair of 452 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
distributions that has this property is said to be a *conjugate family of*  
*prior distributions.* We list below some well-known pairs of conjugate  
families of prior distributions \(see DeGroot \[151\] for derivations\)\:  
**Beta-binomial** are 0-1 random variables from a  
Bernoulli distribution with and has a beta dis-  
tribution with parameters After observing has  
a beta distribution with parameters and  
**Poisson-gamma** have a Poisson distribution with  
mean and has a Gamma distribution with parameters After  
observing has a gamma distribution with parameter  
and  
**Normal-normal** have a normal distribution with a  
known variance but an unknown mean and suppose  
has a normal distribution with mean and variance The posterior  
distribution of is a normal distribution with mean  
and variance  
The following example illustrates the use of these formulas for fore-  
casting\:  
**Example 9.11** \(BAYESIAN FORECASTING\) Consider the following time series\:  
where is, the random variables is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a known variance —that  
are assumed to be from a normal distribution  
Suppose our prior distribution on is modeled as being normal with mean and  
variance The value can be thought of as representing our “best guess” of  
and the value as representing our degree of confidence in this guess.  
After an observation is made, our estimate on the distribution of is updated  
using the update formulas in \(9.39\) and \(9.40\). *Estimation and Forecasting* 453  
After the next observation is made, they are again updated as follows\:  
and so forth. After each observation the revised forecast of is given by  
Notice the ease with which new forecasts can be computed in Exam-  
ple 9.11\. The method is also parsimonious with data\: only the current  
estimates need to be stored and updated; all the previous information is  
contained in the current estimates. However, for distributions that are  
not conjugate, the updating formulas get complicated, and the Bayesian  
method loses its attractive properties.  
**9.3.6.2 Hierarchical and Empirical Bayes Methods**  
Hierarchical Bayes methods are an appealing way to combine sales  
data from multiple locations or sources. For example, a manufacturer  
might be forecasting the sales of its brand across multiple retail chains,  
a retailer might combine the demand data for a product from multiple  
stores locations, or an airline might combine data from multiple flights  
serving a given market.  
The method works as follows\: Let be the number of sources and  
represent the random variables of demand at each source. Let  
denote *N-*vectors of observations of demand at each source  
is assumed to be a vector of *N* i.i.d. realizations of the random variable  
Let be the parameters of the distributions of  
respectively, with densities We assume for simplicity that the  
are scalars.  
How should we combine these observations? The answer depends on  
how the parameters are related. If the parameters are com-  
pletely unrelated, we can estimate each independently. If they are all the  
same, we can simply pool all the data together to forecast  
a single number. However, neither assumption may be satisfactory in a  
given practical forecasting situation. That is, the sources may be related  
but not necessarily identical. Hierarchical Bayes methods address this  
intermediate case. They posit the parameters as realizations 454 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
of a common \(across the sources\) prior distribution of and use the  
information from “all other” data to obtain a prior for the parameter of  
each specific source, which is then updated in a Bayesian manner using  
that source’s data.  
Figure 9.7 shows the hierarchical Bayes model for forecasting First,  
are assumed to be i.i.d. realizations of a density where  
is a *hyperparameter* from a *hyperprior* density Both as well  
as are unknown. Then we estimate in this framework using not  
just but also the other data Let  
and Using the other data, we perform a Bayesian  
update on the hyperparameter to obtain the posterior distribution of *Estimation and Forecasting* 455  
4  
The integral term in \(9.43\) is the probability of observing We can use this to obtain a prior density for a given rule\:  
for  
using Bayes  
From this prior density, we calculate the posterior density of on the data set  
based  
where is the likelihood function of given We can interpret  
as the information on obtained solely from while  
is the “correction” based on the information from the other data  
Notice that throughout, we do not need to estimate or know the value  
of it is integrated out in \(9.44\). However, we do need to know the  
form of the function to calculate \(9.44\). This hyperprior density is  
somewhat removed from the actual data and hence is difficult to interpret  
or assign a priori.  
One way of avoiding specifying the hyperprior density what is called an *empirical Bayes approximation* to is to use  
The em-  
pirical Bayes approximation proceeds as follows. Suppose we represent  
the likelihood \(with respect to given the other data as  
4To avoid excessive notation, we do not write down the normalizing factor and just represent  
the density as being proportional to the right-hand side. So the use of Bayes rule in  
\(9.43\) should be read as  
The density can easily be recovered by dividing by the integral. We do likewise for all  
subsequent applications of Bayes rule in this section. 456 and let *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
denote the ML estimate  
Then instead of using the exact density of \(9.44\) in \(9.45b\), we  
use the approximation to obtain the *MLE posterior density* of  
Of course, \(9.46\) should be easy to solve or else this approximation  
will be difficult to implement. One can even substitute a MSE estimator  
or a method-of-moments estimator \(Sections 9.2.2 and 9.2.4\) instead of  
the ML estimate of \(9.46\) if these make the computations more tractable.  
So one has to choose the densities of and judiciously for com-  
putational convenience. But in the end, the advantage of this method of  
empirical approximation is that it does not require an estimate of  
We illustrate the hierarchical Bayes model with a retail RM example\:  
**Example 9.12** \(SHRINKAGE ESTIMATION OF RETAIL PRICE AND PROMOTIONAL  
ELASTICITIES \(\[75\]\)\) A manufacturer sells a product through multiple chains  
\(collection of stores\). Periodically the manufacturer offers promotions and wants to  
gauge the effect of the promotions on sales. The model of sales during a promotional  
campaign is the following\:  
where  
= logarithm of sales in period  
= relative price in period \(regular price divided by  
an average of competitive regular prices\)  
= deal discount in period \(normal shelf price minus  
actual divided by normal shelf price\)  
= feature advertising in period \(proportion of  
stores in chain using the ad\)  
= display in period \(proportion of  
stores in chain displaying the brand\)  
= 0-1 indicator variable, 1 if period is the final period  
of a multi-week deal, and 0 otherwise  
= maximum deal discount for competing brands in chain in period  
The data consists of *T* periods of sales data from the chains. Let represent the  
log sales of chain-brand at time and the covariate \(explanatory variable  
in \(9.47\), \(*M* = 7\)\) value for period for chain The regression  
models for the log sales for the chains are given by *Estimation and Forecasting* 457  
where the are assumed to have a normal distribution with mean zero and a common  
variance and to be independent. Let and  
We assume is known,5 and let denote  
This is a straightforward regression problem if the stores are estimated separately.  
Let , and the matrix whose elements are  
Then the regression equation for store in matrix form is  
The MSE estimates for are given by \(same as \(9.6\)\)  
However, estimating by chain reduces the size of the data sets and often leads to odd  
predictions with wrong signs on the coefficients or similar calibration problems.  
We can build instead a hierarchical model assuming that each parameter comes  
from a prior normal distribution  
are the hyperparameters with an unknown dis-  
tribution generating the parameters Let  
and  
*If* we knew *and* we had a prior then we could have estimated the mean of the posterior distribution of theorem as \(using a vector version of the formulas in Example 9.11\)  
of the parameters,  
by Bayes  
where  
The new updated mean of \(9.48\) is in a sense a convex combination of the prior mean  
and the actual \(unknown\) mean The mean is “shrunk” toward the hyperparameter  
by the *shrinkage factor*  
The estimate \(9.48\) is unusable however as we do not know  
\(i.e., and \). If we had estimates of the hyperparameters from “other”  
data however, we can use them instead in \(9.48\) for any given chain So the estimates  
of would be a convex combination of a hyperprior estimate of from data other  
than from chain and the data of chain This is the idea behind the hierarchical  
Bayes method.  
In practice, obtaining the ML estimates of from the other data may be too  
difficult. But this does not prevent us from using any reasonable estimate that we  
can obtain based on the other data. Blattberg and George \[75\] give a variety of  
alternatives for the hyperparameter estimates for this regression problem. Also, here  
5 For any given set of estimators of a good estimate of is 458 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
we have constrained the to have identical variances See \[75\] for alternative  
constraints with different interpretations. Blattberg and George \[75\] also consider  
weekly sales data for a national brand and show that hierarchical Bayes methods  
improve predictive performance.  
**9.3.7 State-Space Models and Kalman Filtering**  
Like time-series methods, state-space methods assume the time series  
is driven by an underlying dynamic system. The system is defined  
by a “state” together with a system of equations for describing how  
the state and observable outputs \(say, the time-series data\) evolve over  
time as function of possibly random inputs. The future behavior of  
the system can be completely described by the present state and future  
inputs, a feature known as a *Markovian representation* of the system.  
However, the current state most often is not directly observable and must  
be estimated based on observed data. The following example illustrates  
a simple case of such a system\:  
**Example 9.13** Consider a series being generated by the following model\:  
where is the underlying mean of data Here the mean \(a scalar\) is the  
state of the system, which we cannot observe directly. The mean evolves according  
to the state equation \(9.49b\), which is a linear function of the past state and  
a process noise term The observable output is described by the observation  
equation \(9.49b\) and is equal to the mean plus a measurement noise term  
For a time series generated by \(9.49a\)–\(9.49b\), a forecasting method might proceed  
as follows\: \(i\) keep a current estimate of the underlying state \(ii\) forecast  
\(iii\) after observing the data at time update our current estimate of state  
to and repeat. \(Details of how this can be done are discussed below.\)  
One can view many forecasting models in a state-space framework.  
For example, in simple exponential smoothing equation \(9.19\), the level  
factor can be interpreted as the unobservable state, while Bayesian  
forecasting methods can be viewed as an attempt to estimate an unob-  
servable “state” \(the unknown parameters of the distribution\). More  
generally, if we define the “state” at time as consisting of the com-  
plete history of observations and actions up to time then this state  
would contain all the information relevant for forecasting. Thus, at an  
abstract level, all forecasting models can be cast in a state-space model  
framework. However, such an abstract description is of little practi-  
cal value because the dimension of the state increases without bound  
over time. Hence, for the state-space approach to be useful, we need  
a more compact \(finite-dimensional\) representation of the state, as in *Estimation and Forecasting* 459  
Example 9.13. In this section, we focus on the best known state-space  
forecasting method\: the Kalman filter.  
# 9.3.7.1 The Kalman Filter Formulation  
The Kalman filter is based on a finite-dimensional system of linear  
state and observation equations and zero-centered Gaussian \(normally  
distributed\) noise terms. Under these conditions, the Kalman filter pro-  
vides an efficient algorithm for estimating the state and for forecasting.  
Formally, let the dimensional real vector represent the state at  
time The state is assumed to evolve according to a linear system  
equation\:  
where is a of random variables, called the *process noise,*  
and **A** is a known matrix of parameters. We assume is a  
Gaussian *\(white-noise\)* process—a set of i.i.d. random variables from a  
normal distribution *N* \(**0**, **Q**\), where **Q** is a known matrix called  
the *process-noise covariance* matrix.  
There is a vector of observations,6 which is related  
to the state by the following observation equation\:  
where **H** is a known matrix of parameters, and is a  
of i.i.d. random variables, called the *measurement noise,* that we assume  
has a normal distribution *N*\(0, **R**\), with a known *measurement*  
*noise covariance* matrix **R.** While we assume the matrices **A, H, Q,**  
and **R** are known, in practice they are usually estimated from data as  
discussed later.7 To illustrate this formulation, we give an example of  
the AR\(2\) model in state-space form\:  
**Example 9.14** Consider the AR\(2\) process described in Section 9.3.2, where  
6Note that the observation is a vector here, in contrast to the scalar observations of previous  
sections. We also use **z** and **y** to represent the *random variables* generating **z** and **y**, instead of  
**Z** and **Y** as in the rest of this chapter, to avoid confusion with our matrix notation convention.  
7Here we have also assumed that the matrices **A**, **H**, **Q**, **R** are constant across time. However,  
the theory and the Kalman filter forecasting equations hold even when this data changes over  
time. The Gaussian distribution assumption on the error terms is also not strictly necessary,  
although it is commonly assumed in most applications. 460 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
We can rewrite equation \(9.51\) as a system of state-space equations, as a combi-  
nation of a state-evolution equation,  
and as a measurement equation,  
In a similar fashion, the general model can also be formu-  
lated in a Kalman-filter framework \(see Wei \[560\], p.385\), as can many  
of the other time-series models of Section 9.3.2 \(see Harvey \[243\]\).  
In a forecasting context, the state can be viewed as the \(unobservable\)  
parameters of the true underlying demand-generation process. Each ob-  
servation gives additional information of the parameters, and this infor-  
mation can be used to update our current estimate of the state via the  
state-evolution equation. With the updated state, a forecast for period  
can be made using the prediction equation for period sub-  
stituting the state obtained for period The Kalman filter provides an  
efficient recursive algorithm for performing these operations.  
**9.3.7.2 The Kalman Filter Forecasting Algorithm**  
We first state the Kalman filter forecasting algorithm, and then ex-  
plain the intuition behind it and some of its formal properties.  
The algorithm proceeds as follows. Let the subscript indexing  
denote the value of the variable at time based on all the information  
up to time \(before the observation in period \). At each time we  
keep an estimate of the underlying state that encapsulates all the  
information gained from past observations. After time we get a new  
observation and update our estimate of state to using and  
\(by \(9.50\)\). We then make a forecast for time  
with  
Let and represent, respectively,  
errors from the true state before and after the state estimates have been  
updated. Let and represent,  
respectively, the error covariance matrices. The algorithm is as follows\: *Estimation and Forecasting* 461  
**Initialization\:** Let time Assume initial values of \(say **I**\)  
and the initial state  
**Forecasting step\:** At time project the error, state, and forecast\:  
**Measurement updating step\:** After observing update  
where the matrix is given by  
Update the error covariance  
The matrix is known as the *Kalman gain.* The crucial step is \(9.52\),  
which calculates the a *posteriori* estimate of the state *after* observ-  
ing the measurement in period from the *a priori* estimate \(*be-*  
*fore* observing the measurement in period \). If the disturbances  
are normal, the distribution of the initial state will be normal, and  
the mean and variance of the a *priori* estimate of the state are given  
by and The conjugate distribution of a normal distribu-  
tion is again normal and after observing the measurement the *a*  
*posteriori* distribution of is also normal with mean given  
by \(9.52\). This mean-state vector also turns out to be the minimum  
mean-square estimate of given all the information up to time  
Even when the disturbances are not normal, the Kalman filter  
equations can be shown to be the best *linear* estimator, in the sense of  
minimizing the mean-square error among all linear updates of the form  
that is, the Kalman gain is the matrix  
**K** that minimizes  
An attractive property of the Kalman filter is the recursive nature  
of the algorithm. At each step, we need only to maintain the current  
estimate of the state and the estimate of the covariance matrix. As new  
observations come in, we can then easily update these two quantities. 462 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Moreover, updating these estimates by the Kalman filter equations is  
computationally very efficient, which is one of the most appealing fea-  
tures of the algorithm. The following is a simple example of the operation  
of the Kalman filter\:  
**Example 9.15** \(FORECASTING USING THE KALMAN FILTER\) Let the state evolution  
equations for a 1-dimensional state be given by  
and the measurement be given by the process  
where Filter are  
and Then the state update equations of the Kalman  
and the measurement equations to update the state and measurement are  
where is given by  
Update the error covariance by  
To start off the forecasting process, at we need to assign some values to  
and Rather arbitrarily let’s set As with Bayesian methods, the  
quantity should reflect our degree of certainty about our estimate of the state  
A value of would imply that we are completely sure of our initial estimate;  
more often, we choose some value The precise value is not critical—the  
Kalman filter algorithm is quite robust this way—but the more uncertain we are of  
our estimate, the higher this value should be \(something like would generally  
suffice for this case\).  
Notice the similarity between \(9.53\), which can be rewritten in terms  
of and as  
and the simple exponential smoothing formula \(9.19\), repeated here\: *Estimation and Forecasting* 463  
Indeed, the Kalman gain can be considered as an adaptive smoothing  
factor that changes over time based on the observed data. As  
one can also show the Kalman gain converges to a constant matrix *K,*  
which means, after many observations, the Kalman filter will converge to  
the simple exponential smoothing formula \(9.19\). However, the Kalman  
gains are in fact the “optimal” weighting factors, in the sense that for  
linear state and measurement processes, they minimize the mean-square  
error. 464 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**9.3.7.3 Estimating the Matrices A, H, Q, and R**  
Lastly, we address the question of estimating the matrices **A, H, Q,**  
and **R.** Although the Kalman filter equations are easy to apply if these  
matrices are known, in practice it is highly unlikely that we know their  
exact values. For instance, in the state-space formulation of the AR\(2\)  
process \(9.51\), we do not know the components and of the matrix  
**A.** However, these parameters can be estimated by maximum-likelihood  
methods based on an initial set of observations \(see Harvey \[242\] and  
Harvey \[243\], p.91\). The values used for **Q** and **R** will also affect the  
behavior of the algorithm. If the values we choose for **Q** and **R** are  
much higher than the true variance in the process and measurement  
error terms, then the forecasts tend to be very reactive to noise, and if  
they are much smaller than the actual variances, the forecasts are much  
smoother \(see Figure 9.8\). Again, these variances can also be estimated  
by maximum-likelihood methods.  
**9.3.8 Machine-Learning \(Neural-Network\)**  
# Methods  
All the forecasting methods we have discussed thus far follow the  
same underlying strategy\: posit a functional form for the relationship  
between the observed data and various factors \(such as noise terms, time,  
past observations, and causal factors\) and then estimate the parameters  
of this function using historical data. In contrast, *machine-learning*—  
or specifically, *neural-network*—methods do not make a functional as-  
sumption *a priori;* rather, they use interactions in a network-processing  
architecture to automatically identify the underlying function that best  
describes the demand process. The methods are based on artificial in-  
telligence approaches that mimic the way the human brain learns from  
experience. In theory, with the appropriate architecture and training  
procedure, neural networks are capable of approximating any nonlin-  
ear functional form after a sufficient degree of “learning” on samples  
generated by that function.  
Neural networks have found wide applicability in pattern recognition,  
classification, reconstruction, biology, computer game playing, and time  
series forecasting. Business applications have been reported in market  
analysis, bond rating, credit-risk evaluation, and financial series forecast-  
ing. Some RM vendors and airlines have implemented neural-network  
forecasting methods as well \[496\].  
Neural-network forecasting encompasses a large class of architectures  
and algorithms, and the literature is extensive. Here we only describe  
the workings of a simple neural network with the most basic of training *Estimation and Forecasting* 465  
algorithms. However, this introduction should provide a good sense of  
the overall approach.  
**9.3.8.1 An Overview of Neural Networks**  
A neural network consists of an underlying directed graph and a set  
of additional quantities defined on the graph. In an important class of  
neural networks, the nodes of the network are arranged in consecutive  
layers, and the arcs are directed from one layer to the next, left to right  
as shown in Figure 9.9. Such networks are called *feed-forward* networks  
or *perceptrons* and form the most important class of neural networks used  
for forecasting. We limit our discussion here to feed-forward networks.  
The first layer is called the *input layer* and the last is called the *out-*  
*put layer,* with the layers in the middle being the *hidden layers.* Most  
networks in practice have at most one or two hidden layers. A network  
with a single hidden layer has been shown to be able to approximate  
most nonlinear functional forms \[397\]. The training data is “fed” to the  
input layer, and the forecasts are “read” from the output layer. Typi-  
cally, in demand-forecasting applications, each node in the input layer  
corresponds to an explanatory variables \(analogous to the in the  
linear-regression equation \(9.3\)\), and each node in the output layer cor- 466 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
responds to a future forecast. For example, if we want to use the 20  
most recent historical observations to make forecasts for the next three  
periods, the network would have 20 input nodes \(one for each histori-  
cal observation\) and three output nodes \(one for each forecast\), with a  
certain number of hidden nodes in between.  
More generally, a neural-network architecture is defined by a graph  
where is a set of nodes and is a set of directed arcs.  
The following quantities are defined on the network\:  
A *state variable,* associated with each node Typically, state  
is binary \(every node is either active \(state 1\) or inactive \(state 0\)\)  
or it is continuous, usually taking on values between 0 and 1. The  
state can change for each set of inputs or in an online forecasting  
application after every new observation. Thus, states are said to  
*evolve* over discrete units of time and we represent  
the state of node at time \(observation\) as  
A *weight,* associated with each directed arc  
An *activation threshold value* associated with each node  
Typically, the activation threshold value serves as a threshold for  
making the node active or inactive. For example, if the sum of the  
weights of incoming arcs exceeds then consider node active and  
inactive otherwise.  
An *activation function* \(or *transfer function\),* which determines the  
state of node as a function of the states of other nodes with arcs  
into \(with arcs of the form the arc weights and the  
activation threshold The activation  
functions can be different for each layer \(or even each node\). Typi-  
cally, the activation functions act on the *sum* of the weights of arcs  
from *active* nodes coming into node in which case, the activation  
threshold for can be represented as Acti-  
vation functions serve to make the nodes active or inactive.  
Some examples of transfer functions include the following\:  
A *linear function,* where  
The *Heavyside step function,* which is a simple threshold value  
comparison between and *Estimation and Forecasting* 467  
The *logistic sigmoid functions* \(Figure 9.10\), which are a class of  
monotonic, differentiable functions with  
and  
An example of a logistic sigmoid function is the *Fermi function\:*  
The tanh function\:8  
The value of the transfer function is taken to be the *state* of the  
node. The state is binary \(0 or 1\) for the Heavyside step function and  
continuous for the linear function \(from \) and the logistic  
sigmoid functions \(between 0 and 1\).  
**9.3.8.2 Training and Forecasting**  
Calibration of a neural network is called *training the network.* A set  
of training data is used to calibrate the weights and the values of the  
threshold functions. Once these parameters are determined, the network  
can be used for forecasting. Thus, the three main steps are defining the  
8The tanh function can be shown to be equivalent to the Fermi function after a linear trans-  
formation of the inputs and outputs \(see Bishop \[69\], p.127\). However, the tanh function has  
been found to give faster training convergence and is generally preferred. 468 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
network, training, and forecasting. We illustrate these steps on the  
three-layer network of Figure 9.9.  
**Defining the Network** The input is a set of *I* values of independent  
variables associated with each observation, represented by *I* input nodes,  
and the output is a forecast for *K* future periods, represented by *K* out-  
put nodes. The inputs could consist of all variables that would influence  
the demand. For instance, if the forecast is for demand in a particu-  
lar market for an airline, the input variables, in addition to historical  
demand in that market, could consist of variables such as schedule fre-  
quency, capacity, time in market or economic indicators. Assume there  
are *J* nodes in the hidden layer. We index arcs from the input layer to  
the hidden layer as and arcs from the hidden layer to the output  
layer as  
We next need to define the transfer functions. We use the tanh func-  
tion \(9.55\) as the activation function for the nodes of the hidden  
layer and a linear function as the activation function for the  
nodes of the input and output layers. These functions are defined by the  
activation thresholds the arc weights and the parameter  
of the tanh function.  
Let represent the state of input node and the state of node  
of the hidden layer, and the state of node of the output layer.  
The inputs to the hidden layer are formed by a weighted combination of  
values of the states of the input layer  
and the state of the hidden node is therefore  
The inputs to the output layer in turn are a weighted combination of  
the states of the hidden layer and the activation thresholds of the output  
nodes\:  
The state of the output node definition of the network.  
is then This completes the  
**Training** Once a network topology is chosen, we have to determine val-  
ues for the arc weights and node activation thresholds. This training is, *Estimation and Forecasting* 469  
in all respects but terminology, equivalent to estimating the parameters  
of any other forecasting model from historical data—except that we are  
not working with a simple functional form for the demand generating  
process but rather from a complicated network of interacting functions.  
One of the first, and still quite popular, methods of training is the *er-*  
*ror back-propagation method.* The method uses a squared error criterion  
and prescribes an iterative procedure to update the weights to minimize  
the squared error. Appendix 9.A gives an application of this algorithm  
to the three-layer network of Figure 9.9.  
**Forecasting** Once training is complete, we have a set of values for the  
parameters of the network, and the parameters of the tanh  
function. Since the state of the input nodes is equal to and  
since we chose to be the linear function, the input state is simply the  
input to node Again, the inputs to the hidden layer are a weighted  
combination of values of the states of the input layer  
so the state of the hidden node is computed as  
The inputs to the output layer are again a weighted combination of the  
states of the hidden layer and the activation thresholds of the output  
nodes\:  
The final forecast is then given by state of the output nodes\:  
**9.3.8.3 More Advanced Neural Networks**  
The network architecture and training algorithms described thus far  
form the most basic neural-network methodology. But other variations  
of this method are available. Even for the simple method presented here,  
we have not delved into procedures to choose the number of hidden layers  
or the number of nodes in each layer, or the best choice of the transfer  
functions. For example, there are many procedures to automatically  
prune or grow the network topology based on the observed data and the  
network’s predictive performance. 470 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
As far as training goes, we have described only one of the earliest and  
the most basic of training algorithms. A significant amount of the neural  
network literature is devoted to improving training, in terms of speeding  
up the convergence or ensuring the convergence is to the right parameters  
\(global convergence\), and avoiding overfitting \(Section 9.5.1.4\). The  
interested reader should consult a textbook on neural networks before  
deciding among these various options.  
**9.3.9 Pick-up Forecasting Methods**  
Pick-up forecasting methods exploit some unique characteristics of  
reservation data in quantity-based RM, where the period between re-  
peated service offerings is shorter than the period over which reserva-  
tions are made \(for example, an airline offers a daily flight between two  
cities but accepts reservations for these flights up to 90 days prior to  
departure\). They are best viewed as a forecasting strategy—specifying  
a method for disaggregating and aggregating reservations data—rather  
than a class of fundamentally new forecasting algorithms.  
As we mentioned in Section 9.1.3.4, reservations data has a “wedge-  
shaped” form, in which one has a partial and evolving picture of demand  
over time. Figure 9.11 shows this evolution of demand in matrix and  
graphical form for resources sold on consecutive dates. Rather than re-  
lying only on complete booking histories for forecasting, pick-up meth-  
ods exploit both the complete and partial-bookings data to make better  
forecasts. The main idea is to forecast incremental bookings \(booking  
obtained over short intervals of time prior to service\) and then aggregate  
these increments to obtain a forecast of total demand to come.  
We illustrate this idea with the *additive pick-up method.* Suppose  
for the data in Figure 9.11, we want to forecast for 13-June when we  
have one day remaining. The historical observed bookings on the day of  
departure are 8, 2, and 13 \(for the service dates 12 June, 11 June and 10  
June respectively\). From this data \{8, 2, 13\}, we make an incremental  
forecast for zero-day prior for 13 June \(bookings expected on 13 June\)  
as, say, the mean value of 7.6. Similarly, for the forecast for 14 June,  
we first construct two incremental forecasts, one for zero-day prior and  
the other for one-day prior; sticking to our averaging method, this yields  
incremental forecasts of 7.6 and 3.75, respectively. Then the forecast  
of demand to come for 14 June is the sum of these two increments or  
7.6 + 3.75 = 11.35, and so on, for the other dates in the future.  
Formally, the ahead forecast of demand to come is given by *Estimation and Forecasting* 471  
where represents the incremental bookings forecast days prior to  
the time of service. The forecasts are constructed using the  
available historical incremental bookings. In principle, any  
time-series method can be used to make these incremental forecasts.  
In the *multiplicative pick-up method,* the forecast is performed on  
data normalized as a fraction of current bookings. So if days prior  
to the resource usage date there are 100 total bookings on hand and  
on days prior 10 bookings were observed, then the incremental  
increase is 10% or 0.1. The incremental bookings data is first converted 472 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
to such fractions. In our example in Figure 9.11, to make a forecast  
for 13 June, we convert the zero-day prior incremental bookings into  
\{8/14, 2/55, 13/54\} \(14, 55, and 54 are the total bookings on hand for  
12 June, 11 June, and 10 June, respectively\). Similarly, the one-day  
prior fractions for 14 June are \{2/22, 6/14, 4/55, 3/54\}. We can take the  
average of these fractions to obtain the forecast of the pick-up fraction  
zero-day prior and one-day prior. This would be 0.284 for zero-day prior  
and 0.162 for one-day prior, the average multiplicative “pick-up” over  
current bookings. A forecast of demand to come for 14 June would be  
0.284 × \(33 + 0.162 × 33\) + 0.162 × 33 = 16.23. This is higher than given  
by the additive pick-up method, reflecting the underlying assumption of  
the multiplicative method that future bookings are positively correlated  
with current bookings. Other aggregation strategies and variations are  
possible.  
Again, the advantage of pick-up methods is that they use all the  
available bookings information. Moreover, as partial bookings are recent  
data, using this data can make the forecast more responsive to shifts in  
demand. While the idea is simple and mostly heuristic, pick-up methods  
are widely used in quantity-based RM and reported to perform well.  
**9.3.10 Other Methods**  
Several other methods of forecasting have been reported in RM. The  
*Delphi method* is a formal procedure for extracting analyst and managers’  
opinion on expected demand. It is used primarily in cases where there is  
no historical information, where there is an unexpected demand shock,  
or in some cases when RM is done manually. Fuzzy logic \(Ting and  
Tzeng \[512\]\) and expert systems \(Basgall \[29\]\) have been proposed as the  
basis for a second level of automation in RM forecasting. These systems  
attempt to replicate the rules used by human analysts when monitoring  
and overriding a RM system. Chaos-theoretical models for forecasting  
market response have been proposed by Mulhern and Caprara \[394\], al-  
though we are not aware of widespread use of these techniques in RM.  
Another forecasting method proposed for RM is based on fitting histori-  
cal booking to a set of cumulative booking curves. The current bookings  
on hand are extrapolated using these curves to give the forecast. This  
approach is similar in spirit to the multiplicative pick-up method dis-  
cussed above.  
**9.3.11 Combining Forecast Methods**  
With computing power and storage becoming cheaper by the day, an  
increasingly feasible forecasting strategy is to simultaneously use several *Estimation and Forecasting* 473  
forecasting methods and pick the “best” one. Of course, identifying  
which method is best becomes another forecasting exercise in itself, and  
there have been many proposals for such a model-picking strategy.  
Moreover, it may not even be necessary to identify the best-performing  
method\: a linear combination of the forecasts with an appropriate set  
of weights can turn out to be consistently superior to any one of the  
constituent methods. This idea was proposed in an article by Bates  
and Granger \[30\] and subsequently much investigated by forecasting  
researchers. The intuition behind this result is that if the errors produced  
by two forecasting methods are negatively correlated, then combining  
them will reduce the overall forecast error.  
So what is the best set of weights for such a linear combination? This  
can be determined by finding weights that minimize the mean-squared  
error of the combined forecast. Although it is difficult to obtain such  
weights analytically, various heuristics have been proposed \(see the Notes  
and Sources of this chapter for references\). The weights themselves can  
adapt to fresh data and be updated from period to period.  
We give one set of weights proposed by Bates and Granger \[30\] to  
combine forecasts from two different models. Let be the mean-  
squared error of model Let be the coefficient of correlation  
between the errors in the forecasts of the two models. Then define the  
weights as and where is given by\:  
Then the combined forecast is given by  
Another combination scheme, this time using adaptive weights that  
vary over time, is to set at time where  
where is the mean squared error of model at time The  
interested reader should consult Montgomery et al. \[388\], Gupta and  
Winston \[230\], and Foster and Vohra \[192\] for other similar rules and  
their properties.  
**9.4 Data Incompleteness and Unconstraining**  
We next look at forecasting from data that is either missing or par-  
tially observable, a common situation in RM. Indeed, once a product is 474 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
closed or capacity is sold out, we normally stop observing demand at  
that point because most reservation systems record only actual book-  
ings and not “attempted bookings.” Ignoring this censoring can cause a  
significant bias in the forecasts, For instance, consider a product that  
had been closed consistently in the past. Its observed demand would be  
uniformly zero, and a forecast based on this data would forecast demand  
as zero. However, if the optimization system had opened this product,  
a positive demand might have been observed.  
Incompleteness can occur in price-based RM when sales \(and no-sales\)  
are not directly observable. This can make it difficult to obtain complete  
information on customer purchase behavior. For example, if a customer  
decides not to purchase because some alternative is not available in the  
retail store, this information frequently goes unrecorded. Ignoring these  
lost sales can lead to a bias in the forecasts if the data is not corrected  
to account for the missing information.  
Of course, companies that sell directly through their own call centers  
or websites have the potential, in theory, to capture attempted reserva-  
tions or no-purchase outcomes. However, in our experience few actually  
do. And given the significant role that third-party reservations systems  
and distribution channels play in many RM industries, the problem of  
incomplete data remains an important one in RM forecasting.  
Fortunately, there are several good methods available for correcting  
for incomplete data, which we discuss here. Our description of these  
methods is focused primarily on quantity-based RM because this is where  
the incomplete-data problem is most acute. However, the techniques are  
also used for estimating parameters in price-based RM, such as when  
correcting for stock-outs or unobservable heterogeneity in retail RM.  
**9.4.1 Expectation-Maximization \(EM\) Method**  
The *expectation-maximization \(EM\) method* is the most widely used  
method for correcting for constrained data in quantity-based RM. While  
the algorithm can be described in generic form, it is easiest to understand  
it by looking at specific examples. Because of its importance, we give  
two such examples below, one for the independent fare class model and  
the other for the discrete choice demand model.  
**9.4.1.1 Unconstraining in an Independent Booking Class**  
# Model Using EM  
Consider the independent-demand model of Section 2.2, in which the  
demand for each product is assumed to be independent of the demand for  
other products. Since most current quantity-based RM implementations *Estimation and Forecasting* 475  
assume independent demand for products, the method described here \(or  
variations of it\) is very prevalent in practice.  
Suppose we have *M + N* observations of bookings for a given prod-  
uct, of which *M* observations are constrained because the  
product was closed. We ignore the time-series aspect of the observations  
and treat as an unordered set of observations generated  
by an i.i.d. process. Specifically, if the time-series data has trend or sea-  
sonality, the EM algorithm cannot be applied as shown below. \(Com-  
bining unconstraining with time-series forecasting is more complicated.  
See McGill \[376\].\) Our goal is to find the parameters of an underlying  
demand distribution for these observations.  
Assume that the underlying demand distribution is normal with mean  
and standard deviation \(The same unconstraining procedures can  
be applied—albeit with different formulas—for many other distribution  
as well.\) We further assume that *all* the observations come from a com-  
mon distribution and that the observations are constrained at random,  
i.e., they appear randomly in the sample.9 Since we are treating the  
observations as unordered, assume are constrained \(*right cen-*  
*sored\)* at booking limits so that The  
remaining *N* observations are unconstrained.  
If the data were not constrained, then it would be easy to construct  
the complete-data likelihood function. Namely,  
with the complete-data log-likelihood function given by  
The solution  
and that maximizes ln *L*\(·\) in \(9.57\) are given by the closed-form  
9In the RM context this assumption implies that there is no correlation among demand on  
days when the product is sold out. Strictly speaking, this assumption rarely holds in RM  
practice, but it is common to ignore this correlation possibility as the alternative statistical  
methods are considerably more complicated. 476 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
\(See Example 9.5.\) However, we do not know the true values of the  
*M* constrained observations and therefore cannot use this  
procedure directly.  
The EM method uses this complete-data likelihood function in an  
iterative algorithm with an alternating *E-step* and *M-step* \(hence the  
name\). The E-step replaces the censored data by estimates of their  
uncensored values using the current estimates of the mean and standard  
deviation. The M-step then maximizes the complete-data log-likelihood  
function based on this updated data to obtain new estimates of the  
mean and standard deviation. The procedure is then repeated until  
the parameter estimates converge. The advantage of this approach is  
that it is much easier to estimate the complete-data likelihood than it  
is to estimate the incomplete-data log-likelihood function. Hence, even  
though we have to solve the complete-data likelihood problem many  
times, the overall algorithm is still very efficient.  
Specifically, for our normal distribution example, let repre-  
sent the estimates of the parameters of the normal distribution after the  
iteration of the algorithm. The steps of the EM algorithm for our  
time series follow\:  
**STEP 0 \(Initialize\)\:** Initialize and to be and Good  
candidates for these starting values are the sample mean and sample  
standard deviation of all the unconstrained observations.  
Let be a small number, to be used as a stopping criterion.  
**STEP 1 \(E-step\) \:** Calculate the expected value of the censored data  
in the log-likelihood function assuming that they come from a normal  
distribution *X* with parameters That is, for  
calculate  
and  
The formulas for these conditional expectations are somewhat com-  
plex but involve simply evaluating two integrals. *Estimation and Forecasting* 477  
Next, for each censored observation replace by  
and by to form the complete-data log-likelihood function  
as in \(9.57\). Note in this way we are simply replacing the con-  
strained values in the log-likelihood function by their expected values  
given the current estimates of the mean and standard deviation.  
**STEP 2 \(M-step\)\:** Maximize with respect to and to ob-  
tain yielding  
and  
STEP 3 \(Convergence test\)\: IF THEN STOP;  
ELSE, GOTO STEP 1.  
and  
If the expected log-likelihood is continuous in the parameters \( and  
in our case\), a result by Wu \[582\] shows that if the sequence of EM  
estimates converges, the limiting value will be a stationary point of the  
incomplete log-likelihood function. Whether the sequence diverges—  
or converges to something other than the global maximum—is more  
difficult to determine and depends on the characteristics of the data set.  
In practice, however, the EM method has proved to be very robust.  
Once convergence has been achieved—say, in iteration *K*—the uncon-  
strained values for can be taken as where  
*X* is normally distributed with  
**Example 9.16** Consider the data set of bookings in Table 9.4 from 11 Jan to 29  
Jan. The data on 13 Jan, 16 Jan and 18 Jan is constrained at the booking limit 17,  
22, and 15 respectively. Assume the data comes from a normal distribution. Based  
on the constrained data, the parameters of the normal distribution  
Let *C* be the capacity constraint, *D* the demand, the unconstrained value at  
the iteration, and Then at the iteration, replace by 478 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
given by the following formula for the normal distribution  
So at the first iteration, replace 17 by 23.544, 22 by 25.416, and 15 by and 23.579.  
At the second iteration, replace 23.544 by 24.216, and so on. As can be seen from  
Table 9.4, the algorithm quickly converges \(in this case; convergence is much slower  
in general\) to  
**9.4.1.2 Unconstraining in a Discrete-Choice Dynamic**  
# Model Using EM  
We next consider the problem of unconstraining under the dynamic  
discrete-choice model of Section 2.6.2. Recall that in this model there is  
an arrival probability in each period and consumers select among the  
available classes according to a discrete-choice model. The RM control  
problem is then to decide which products to make available at each  
point in time. We consider here a multinomial-logit model similar to  
Example 9.6, where the probability that an arriving customer purchases *Estimation and Forecasting* 479  
alternative from a set *S* is given by  
where is a vector of attributes of alternative and is a vector of  
parameters. The no-purchase probability is  
The difficulty here is estimating the parameters and from purchase  
data. Specifically, if we have only purchase data, it is impossible to dis-  
tinguish a period without an arrival, from a period in which there was  
an arrival but the arriving customer did not purchase. With this incom-  
pleteness in the data, the complete-data maximum-likelihood estimation  
procedure of Example 9.6 cannot be used.  
However, we can again apply the EM algorithm to correct for the  
missing data. The broad strategy is the same as the one for the normal  
distribution case in Section 9.4.1\: start with arbitrary initial estimates  
of the parameters and the arrival rate Then use these estimates to  
compute the conditional expected value of \(the expectation  
step\). Maximize the resulting expected log-likelihood function to gener-  
ate new estimates and \(the maximization step\), and repeat till the  
procedure converges.  
Suppose there are *T* periods. Let *P* denote the set of periods in which  
customers purchase and denote period in which there are no purchase  
transactions. Let if there is an arrival in period and  
if there is no arrival. Let denote the choice made by an arrival in  
period We can then write the complete log-likelihood function as  
The unknown data are the values ever, given estimates and \(denoted \) easily via Bayes rule\:  
in the second sum. How-  
we can determine their expected values 480 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
where  
is the no-purchase probability for an arrival in period given  
Substituting into \(9.58\) we obtain the expected log-likelihood  
As in the case of the complete log-likelihood function, this function is  
separable in and Maximizing with respect to we obtain the  
updated estimate  
This is intuitive; our estimate of lambda is the number of observed  
arrivals plus the estimated number of arrivals from unobservable  
periods divided by the total number of periods  
We can then maximize the first two sums in \(9.60\) to obtain the updated  
estimate Note that this expression is of the same functional form as  
the complete data case \(9.11\). The entire procedure is then repeated.

One interesting fact is that there can be multiple pairs that  
produce the same probabilities of sales. In this case, the EM and logit  
estimates will find only one such pair. To take a trivial case, suppose  
there is only fare product and that and are scalars. The  
probability that we observe a sale if this fare product is open is then  
It is clear that there are a continuum of values that will produce the  
same value However, the maximum-likelihood estimate will identify  
only one such pair. This difficulty is not a fault of the EM or logit method  
per se; it is a reflection of the fact that—as in this simple example—  
there may be more than one model that produces the same purchase  
probabilities. In such cases, it is simply not possible to uniquely identify  
the model from observed data; there is, in effect, a degree of freedom  
that we cannot resolve.  
**9.4.2 Gibbs Sampling**  
While the EM algorithm is the most popular and widely used method  
for unconstraining in RM applications, there are alternative statistical  
methods to deal with constrained data. We briefly describe one tech-  
nique here, called *Gibbs sampling,* which is part of a broader set of meth-  
ods called *Markov-chain Monte Carlo \(MCMC\)* methods. Although not  
widely used in forecasting for quantity-based RM, they have found ap-  
plication in price-based RM \(Allenby and Rossi \[10\], Allenby, Arora, and  
Ginter \[8\]\), econometrics \(Chib and Greenberg \[115\]\), and missing-data  
problems \(Schafer \[456\]\).  
MCMC methods simulate a \(typically intractable\) target distribution  
of a \(multidimensional\) random variable **Z** by repeatedly simulating 482 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
a sequence where each element in the sequence de-  
pends on the previously generated element, and the limiting distribution  
of as is the target distribution By generating enough  
of these sequences, we can reconstruct the entire distribution  
We first describe the Gibbs sampling method in general and then  
apply it to the censored normal example in Section 9.4.1.1. Let a random  
vector *Z* be partitioned into *J* subvectors  
Let be the joint distribution of **Z** —-that is, the target distribu-  
tion. The Gibbs algorithm is applicable whenever is unknown, in-  
tractable, or difficult to sample from, but all the distributions  
for is the vector X but without the block\) have  
known distributions that are easy to sample from.  
Let be the generated sample at the  
iteration.  
**Gibbs algorithm\:** Repeat the following steps till convergence \(the cri-  
teria for which are discussed later\) \:  
Generate from  
Generate from  
Generate from  
The stationary distribution of the sequence under rela-  
tively mild conditions, can be shown to converge to the joint distribution  
The use of Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation usually proceeds  
in a Bayesian framework, in which we assume a prior distribution on the  
parameters, and—from a practical point of view—choose a conjugate  
family of distributions for the parameters.  
To illustrate, let’s see how to apply Gibbs sampling method to esti-  
mate the unconstrained mean and variance of a sample from a censored  
normal distribution with unknown mean and standard deviation,  
Assume as in the previous section that we have a sequence of *M +*  
*N* independent observations where the first *M* observations are *Estimation and Forecasting* 483  
constrained at Our problem is to estimate and  
It is convenient to assume that \( given \) has a “prior” normal  
distribution and a “prior” inverted chi-square distribution,10 denoted  
by This particular choice of distributions ensures the posterior  
distributions of and are normal and inverted chi-square again.  
The vector **Z** is then assumed to consist of two blocks—the first, of  
the unknown parameters and the second, the vector of censored  
observations The Gibbs algorithm begins with initial val-  
ues for these two subvectors. For instance, as we did in the case of the  
EM application, take initially equal to the sample mean and stan-  
dard deviation of and set the vector equal  
to the vector of censored values  
At the step, generate  
as *M* independent draws.  
Next generate new values for  
from a normal and inverted chi-square distribution, respectively, as fol-  
lows\:  
where and are the sample mean and standard deviation of the *M*  
generated values and the *N* unconstrained values\:  
This procedure is repeated until the distributions of  
reach stationarity. However, testing for stationarity of a distribution can  
be problematic \(Section 9.3.2.1\), so in practice a number of heuristic  
termination criteria are used \[456\]. The resulting expected value of  
and can then be used as our parameter estimates.  
**9.4.3 Kaplan-Meir Product-Limit Estimator**  
The Kaplan-Meir product-limit \(PL\) estimator \(\[289\]\) is another ap-  
proach to censored-data estimation. Its origins lie in survival analysis  
\(with continuous distributions\), but here we present it in terms of cen-  
sored demand observations. It is a nonparametric method, the output of  
has a chi-square dis-  
10 A random variable *Y* has an inverted chi-square distribution if tribution. 484 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
which is an estimate of the complete distribution \(as in Gibbs sampling\)  
rather than the parameters of an assumed distribution.  
As before, assume we have *M+N* observations with the  
first *M* being constrained \(right-censored\) at the values So  
the observations are of the form where is the booking-  
limit \(called the *limits of observation;* the event is called a *loss*\)*.*  
As earlier, is considered independent of The *survival function* of  
is defined as and an estimate of it is equivalent to  
an estimate of the distribution of *Z.*  
The PL estimate of the survival function is then given as follows.  
List and label the *M + N* observations in order of increasing magnitude,  
so that For a particular value let  
That is, is the set of indices in the  
ordered list that are not constrained by the booking limits and have  
values less than Then  
where each term above is an estimate of the conditional probability that  
the demand exceeds given that it exceeds The main idea behind  
Kaplan-Meir estimate is best explained via a simple example\:  
**Example 9.17** Suppose that we have four observations with bookings  
\{5, 10\*, 11, 18\}, where the superscript \* signifies a constrained observation. Suppose  
we are interested in the probability that If we ignore the constrained  
observation \(that is, base our estimate on the unconstrained reduced sample\), we get  
an estimate of 1/3 \(one of the three unconstrained values exceeds 15\).  
However, we can also view as equal to  
Then we estimate \(based on the full sample\) and  
\(based on the sample of last two observations\), and we obtain  
So the estimate of helps in obtaining a better estimate of  
Kaplan and Meier show that the estimator in \(9.62\) gives the dis-  
tribution that maximizes the likelihood of the observations. The curve  
given by \(9.62\) is remarkably easy to compute and makes no parametric  
assumptions. However, it can be inefficient \(Miller \[384\]\) and difficult  
to compare by eye \(Efron \[173\]\), and it is also difficult to compute con-  
fidence intervals for a Kaplan-Meier estimator.  
**9.4.4 Plotting Procedures**  
A hybrid parametric/nonparametric approach to censored data is  
based on simply fitting a parametric distribution to an nonparametric  
survivor function estimate such as derived using the Kaplan-Meir *Estimation and Forecasting* 485  
estimator. Such methods are called *plotting procedures*, because they  
correspond to plotting an empirical distribution and then inferring pa-  
rameters from this plotted distribution.  
To take a simple case, if the distribution is assumed to be exponential,  
so that then we have that  
Hence, if we plot the empirical function it should roughly be  
linear, with slope equal to One could estimate this slope via linear  
regression, for example. In the case of a normal distribution with mean  
and standard deviation the distribution is  
where is the standard normal distribution. Hence,  
where is the inverse of the standard normal distribution. There-  
fore, by plotting we should expect to see roughly a straight  
line with slope and intercept Again, values for the slope and  
intercept can be determined using linear regression.  
While somewhat less rigorous in a strict statistical sense than other  
censored-data methods, plotting procedures can be attractive in practice  
because they are simple and intuitive.  
**9.4.5 Projection-Detruncation Method**  
The *projection- detruncation method* is similar in spirit to the EM al-  
gorithm. It has been used in the PODS simulations for quantity-based  
RM and its origin is credited to Hopperstad \(\[256, 42, 587\]\).  
The variation over the EM method of Section 9.4.1.1 is that in the  
E-step of the algorithm, instead of replacing the constrained values  
by an estimate of the conditional mean  
it replaces the values by the solution of the following equation  
where is a fixed constant throughout the algorithm. While there is no  
formal theoretical justification of \(9.63\) or a proof of convergence, the 486 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
heuristic interpretation is as follows. Note that \(9.63\) can be written  
So corresponds to selecting a fixed fractile of the conditional  
distribution given the current parameter estimates For  
example, selecting would correspond to estimating as  
the *median* of the conditional distribution, whereas the EM method uses  
the *mean* of the conditional distribution. Hence, by using a small  
value the constrained observations are unconstrained more aggressively  
than may be the case in the EM method. Whether this leads to more  
accurate estimation of the mean or a faster convergence than the EM  
algorithm is not known, however. Zeni \[587\] gives an example comparing  
the estimates of the two methods for and the estimate of the  
mean of the projection-detruncation method is nearly 10 percent higher  
than that given by the EM algorithm, though one can arguably attribute  
this to the choice of  
**9.5 Error Tracking and System Control**  
As mentioned, all forecasts are subject to some degree of error. Hence,  
understanding and responding correctly to forecast errors are important  
tasks in practice. Here we review the main methods for error tracking  
and system control.  
A forecaster needs to consider several types of errors. The differ-  
ence between the observed data and a model fit to this data is called  
the *estimation error.* Such error could be due to many factors\: nat-  
ural randomness in the demand process, unobservable characteristics of  
the products or demand, mispecifications, unrealistic model assumptions  
such as independence of the variables or error terms. We group all such  
errors—errors in the estimation of the parameters of the model or the  
specification of the model—as estimation errors.  
*Forecasting error,* on the other hand, is the difference between a  
model’s predictions for a *future* observation and the subsequent observa-  
tion. The difference between forecast and estimation errors is a matter  
of timing. Large estimation errors might compel us to refine the model  
or “fix” it in some way *now* because we are aware of the errors. Fore-  
casting errors, on the other hand, are unknown at the time of the model  
specification and are realized only over time. There is also a dynamic,  
online aspect to forecasting error and system control that is distinct from  
the one-shot nature of estimation.  
It is natural to suppose that a model that fits historical data well  
that, say has low estimation errors, will also generalize well and give *Estimation and Forecasting* 487  
low forecast errors. This, however, is not the case. As we show in  
Section 9.5.1.4, it is not uncommon to fit a model to give near-zero esti-  
mation errors based on observed data, but then find that it has atrocious  
predictive power. Indeed, forecasting can be said to be the art of under-  
standing estimation errors \(their sources and reasons\) and then selecting  
and training a model properly for optimum prediction power.  
**9.5.1 Estimation Errors**  
We first look at issues involved in analyzing estimation errors—in par-  
ticular, bias, specification error, model-selection criteria, and overfitting.  
**9.5.1.1 Bias Detection and Correction**  
Bias in the parameter estimates of a model is called *estimation bias.*  
This could arise because of the lack of a good estimator, incomplete data,  
or nonconvergence of the estimation procedures. A bias in the parameter  
estimates of a model leads to a bias in the forecasts, and in general, it is  
desirable to eliminate it. If the cause of the bias were known, we would,  
of course, fix the bias by eliminating the cause, but this is not always  
possible—for lack of development time, investigation time, or data, and  
so on. If this is the case, a simple and general method for correcting  
for parameter bias is the so-called *jackknife estimator* \(Quenouille \[431\];  
Tukey \[519\]\), which we describe next.  
Suppose is a parameter and on an i.i.d. sample Suppose that an estimator of the parameter based  
is a biased estimator of  
the following form  
That is, a order 1/*N* term and a second-order error term. The jackknife  
estimator is calculated as follows. Let be the estimator applied to  
the sample with the observation removed. Define  
Define the \(first-order\) jackknife estimator as  
which has the rather nice property that  
Higher-order jackknife estimators can be defined that eliminate  
higher-order biases. Besides bias correction, the jackknife is a valuable 488 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
tool for interval estimation and has connections to bootstrap methods  
\(Miller \[385\]; Davison and Hinkley \[148\]\).  
While bias is usually undesirable, biased estimators may occasionally  
be beneficial if they lead to lower variance \(more efficient\) estimates. To  
give an example, if some of the explanatory variables in a linear regres-  
sion are correlated \(multicollinearity\), the coefficients of the regression  
will have a high variance. A method for reducing this variance is *ridge*  
*regression,* which minimizes an objective consisting of the sum of the  
variance of the parameter estimates and the bias squared, so a small  
amount of bias is deliberately accepted \(Judge et al. \[273\]\).  
**9.5.1.2 Specification Errors**  
*Specification errors* are errors resulting from flawed model assump-  
tions; that is, errors arising from a model that does not reflect the un-  
derlying data-generating process. In short, how can we be certain that  
the function used \(9.2\) is indeed the “right” function to use, both ex-  
plaining observed values of *Z* as well as providing good predictive power  
for future observations? Managerial judgment, visual inspection, data  
analysis, and statistical tests all play a role in answering this question.  
Specification tests are designed to test whether a given model and  
its corresponding assumptions are correct. Failure to pass such a test  
could mean one of the following\: the functional form is inadequate to  
represent the data-generating process; the functional form is correct,  
but the wrong set of independent variables have been used in the model;  
both the functional form and variable choice are correct, but the error  
term distribution is misspecified; or assumptions on the error term of the  
model \(such as homoscedasticity or independence of errors\) are violated.  
There are several tests to check for misspecification \(see also Sec-  
tion 9.2.2\). The simplest ones are graphical, such as plotting values  
of the empirical distribution against the fitted distribution to look for a  
straight-line relationship, or Q-Q plots, in which the quantiles of the the-  
oretical distribution are plotted on the and the ordered fractions  
of the observed values on the \(a good fit is when all the values are  
along the diagonal\). Testing an empirical distribution against a given  
theoretical distribution can be done using statistical procedures such as  
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We refer the reader to DeGroot \[151\],  
pp. 554–559 for details on such tests.  
**Coefficient of Determination for Regressions** The statistic most  
widely used in regressions to measure goodness of fit is the *coefficient of* *Estimation and Forecasting* 489  
*determination* defined as follows for *N* observations\:  
where are the observations, is the estimate for observation based  
on the estimated parameters, and is the mean of *N* observations.  
The value varies between 0 and 1 and signifies the percentage of the  
total variation in the dependent observations explained by the regression  
relationship. Thus, a high value of is desirable. Most commercial  
statistical programs \(SAS, SPSS, R, S, IMSL, MINITAB, Statistica, and  
so on\) compute this statistic automatically.  
However, the choice of functional form is important, and one should  
not rely on quantitative measures alone. A forecaster’s business intuition  
about the relationships and causal variables ought to play as big a role  
as formal statistical tests. A good value or a good visual fit does not  
imply a regression has good explanatory power, as we discuss below in  
Section 9.5.1.4 on overfitting.  
The statistics of regression is concerned with many more issues than  
just estimating parameters and calculating values. Statistical tests  
exist for determining which of the independent variables is redundant,  
their degree of importance in determining the independent variable, their  
goodness of fit to the functional form, the appropriateness of the func-  
tional form and the assumptions on the errors, and so forth. For exam-  
ple, if the parameter estimates are assumed to be normal, then a  
can be used to determine if the estimate is within a given interval about  
the true parameter value with a certain level of confidence. Similarly,  
a F-test can be used to test if some of the parameters are effectively  
redundant \(values close to zero\) and can be eliminated. The details  
of such tests are beyond the scope of this chapter, but these tests are  
standard and described in most statistics or econometrics texts \(Kvanli  
et al. \[318\]; Judge et al. \[273\]; Draper and Smith \[161\]; Guttman \[231\];  
Neter and Wasserman \[403\]\).  
**Tests Against an Alternate Specification** One form of a specifica-  
tion test is to test a null hypothesis that a given specification is correct  
against an alternate \(usually more general\) specification hypothesis. De-  
pending on the type of null hypothesis, there are three classical specifi-  
cation tests one can use\: *likelihood ratio* \(LR\), *Wald,* and the *Lagrange*  
*multiplier* \(LM\) tests. We describe only the LR test here.  
Let denote the vector of model parameters. Let the null hypothesis  
be that and the alternate hypothesis be that where  
typically Then the likelihood of the observed data is as defined 490 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
in \(9.8\). The likelihood ratio is  
If this ratio is small, the null hypothesis is rejected. That is, there is a  
significant loss of likelihood by restricting the parameter set to One  
attractive feature of the likelihood ratio is that the statistic  
is asymptotically distributed, and this fact can be used for hypothesis  
testing.  
**Tests for Misspecification** In contrast to the tests in the previous  
section, a test for misspecification does not specify a single alternate hy-  
pothesis. Instead, the null hypothesis is that the specification is correct  
and the alternate hypothesis is that there is a misspecification. Nat-  
urally, this is appealing as we are testing against a large number of  
alternative specifications using a single test. We describe next, infor-  
mally, a general misspecification test strategy due to Hausman \(Haus-  
man \[245\]; also attributed to Durbin \[169\] and Wu \[583\]\). We illustrate  
it by applying it to testing the IIA property in a discrete-choice model  
\(Section 7.2.2.3\).  
To describe the idea behind the Hausman test, consider a specifica-  
tion test as in the previous section. The null hypothesis is that a  
given specification is true; the alternate hypothesis is that another  
specification is true. Let be a consistent and asymptotically efficient  
estimator achieving the Cramer-Rao bound on the variance of the para-  
meters \(Section 9.2.1.3\) of the specification under \(In most cases,  
there would exist such an estimator if the null hypothesis were true;  
for instance, the maximum-likelihood estimators are consistent and as-  
ymptotically efficient \[220\] under some mild regularity conditions.\) If  
instead were true, then will be biased and inconsistent under  
\(provided and are sufficiently different and assuming that the  
specification of uses the same vector of parameters as that of  
Let be some other estimator for the specification of  
but asymptotically inefficient under but consistent under also.  
If such estimators exist, then one can construct a test statistic out of  
the difference as this difference should be approximately  
centered at zero.  
Hence, to test for misspecification when there is no alternate specifi-  
cation, one can proceed by choosing two distinct estimators for the null  
hypothesis specification—one efficient and one not efficient but more ro- *Estimation and Forecasting* 491  
bust \(consistent even under a mispecification\) than the first one. Then,  
if the model is correctly specified, the difference between the estimators  
will very likely have a mean away from zero. To apply the statistic,  
the variance of has to be calculated, which fortunately turns  
out to be equal to the difference of the variances of and The  
test statistic used is which can be shown to have an asymp-  
totically distribution \(Hausman \[245\]; MacKinnon \[352\]\). With no  
misspecification, will tend to 0 w.p.1.  
This specification test strategy, called the *Hausman-type test,* is quite  
general and has found many applications in econometrics. We illustrate  
the test by an example relevant to RM and price-response estimation.  
**Example 9.18** \(HAUSMAN-McFADDEN SPECIFICATION TEST FOR THE MNL  
DISCRETE-CHOICE MODEL \(\[244\]\)\) Given a set of observations of choices among  
alternatives made by a population of *N* individuals, we would like to know if the  
MNL model is the correct specification for the choice process. Assume that the no-  
purchase choices are also observed.  
Recall that the MNL model is characterized by the IIA property \(Section 7.2.2.3\)\:  
the ratio of the probabilities of choosing any two alternatives is independent of the  
attributes or the availability of a third alternative. Let be the set of  
alternatives, the probability of choosing alternative *i* is given by \(7.6\)  
where is the *M*-vector of attributes and relevant characteristics of the decision  
maker for alternative and is a *M*-vector of parameters to be  
estimated \(assumed to be jointly normal with a covariance matrix  
If *S* a subset of the alternatives, then if the IIA property holds, for  
where  
If the IIA property fails to hold, there has to be a set 5 where \(9.67\) fails to hold.  
So if we restrict our population to customers who purchased only in *S,* we obtain an  
estimate based only on this data, with its covariance matrix estimated by  
Letbe the corresponding estimates for the full choice set.  
Note that there may be some elements of the *M*-vector of parameters that may not  
be identifiable from data restricted to purchases in *S* \(for instance, alternative-specific  
variables where the alternatives are not in *S\).* If such is the case, we have to restrict  
ourselves to a subvector corresponding to explanatory variables that vary within *S,*  
but for simplicity, assume that this subvector coincides with the full *M*-vector of  
explanatory variables.  
The Hausmann specification test is based on the difference If  
the IIA property holds, the two estimates and should coincide, and will 492 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
be a consistent estimator of 0. Then if the test statistic  
is the variance-covariance matrix of  
is asymptotically distributed with degrees of freedom given by the rank of  
The null hypothesis can then be accepted or rejected with a specified degree of  
confidence. In principle, this has to be tested for all possible subsets *S* of Also,  
there is no guarantee that the variance-covariance matrix is invertible. Haus-  
mann and McFadden report that the test is not very powerful unless deviations from  
MNL are substantial.  
**9.5.1.3 Model Selection**  
Model selection is one of the most subtle tasks in estimation. There  
are no clear-cut rules; intuition, judgment, experience, and repeated  
testing are required to find a model that generalizes well and has good  
predictive power. We have already seen one iterative process for choosing  
a model—the Box-Jenkins methodology of Section 9.3.5 for time-series  
models. In this section we present additional statistical guidelines, less  
elaborate than Box-Jenkins, for selecting a model.  
Formally, these are decision rules for selecting one of *K* possible mod-  
els The models can be time-series models or regression  
models or others, each with a set of parameters that we assume are  
estimated by a maximum-likelihood procedure. Let represent  
the maximum-likelihood of model based on the *N* observations  
where is the parameter vector of model of  
dimension  
**Selection Criteria** The simplest way to select a model is to rank  
the models according to some goodness-of-fit criterion and choose the  
highest-ranking one. Various decision rules have been proposed to do  
this, the two classical ones being the following\:  
**Bayes information criterion \(BIC\)** The BIC of model is defined  
as  
and the best model is the one with the smallest BIC.  
**Akaike information criterion \(AIC\)** The AIC of model is de-  
fined as  
and the best model is the one with the smallest AIC.  
A number of competing criteria have been proposed, including the  
Fisher information criterion \(FIC\) \[442, 559\], cross-validation \(CV\) \[492, *Estimation and Forecasting* 493  
12\], final prediction error \(FPE\) \[464\], generalized information criterion  
\(GIC\) \[435\].  
**Bayesian Selection** Both the BIC and AIC have theoretical roots in  
the Bayesian model-selection methodology, which we describe next. Let  
be the density function of model Let be the prior  
distribution of the parameters of model  
Given the data, which model is most likely? By Bayes formula,  
where is the likelihood function for model Consider the posterior odds of a model with the prior  
over  
The Bayes factor indicates whether model if is \> 1, then is preferred.  
Varying and summing over ability of model as  
is preferred to model  
we get the posterior prob-  
Computing the Bayes factors can be difficult in practice, as calculating  
involves multiple integration over the prior density  
One alternative is to use a holdout sample to get estimates of and  
then use instead of computing the integral explicitly. The  
prior distribution is typically also calculated from a holdout sample.  
**Variable Selection** Another task in model selection is deciding, within  
a given model class, which variables should be included. It is generally  
undesirable to include too many variables. Correlations among inde-  
pendent variables can lead to erroneous coefficient estimates, as in the  
phenomenon of multicollinearity in linear regression. Even if the ex-  
planatory variables are independent, the principle of *Occam’s razor*  
11  
11 The Occam’s razor principle of scientific investigation states that if *E* represents the evi-  
dence and *P\(H|E\)* the probability of a specified hypothesis *H* given the evidence, if 494 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
prescribes that one should make do with as few variables as possible to  
achieve a given level of predictive power.  
Formally, given a choice of *M* possible explanatory variables  
which is the best subset to use? We can use the model-  
selection criteria discussed above \(AIC, BIC, FIC\), treating each subset  
choice as a different model. However, for large *M* this is computationally  
quite burdensome as there are possible combinations of variables.  
A simpler methodology, often employed in practice, is to begin with an  
initial subset and then try adding one variable at a time—testing to  
see if it increases some measure of predictive power. Similarly, one can  
begin with a full set and remove one variable at a time, testing for loss  
of predictive power at each step. See Miller \[382\] for a comprehensive  
treatment of subset selection procedures.  
More sophisticated search techniques for variable subset selection,  
based on hierarchical Bayes models and Gibbs sampling, have also been  
proposed \(Mitchell and Beauchamp \[387\]; George and McCulloch \[207\]\).  
**9.5.1.4 Overfitting**  
In this section we look at a common problem with fitting a model to  
training data—namely, *overfitting.* Rather than discuss it generally, we  
illustrate the problem of overfitting with an example.  
Consider a set of data that is generated by the following formula  
\(unknown to the forecaster\)\:  
If we perform a nonlinear regression on the first 10 points using a  
degree polynomial of the form we obtain  
the fit shown in Figure 9.12. This on surface appears to fit the data  
well. A cubic polynomial fit to the same data set does not providing  
as exact a fit on the first 11 points. However, using the formula for  
the degree polynomial for forecasting is disastrous; for instance, its  
projection for the data point is -21.77, while the actual value is 0.66,  
and the accuracy of projections further in the future is even worse. The  
cubic polynomial, in contrast, has less forecast error. The degree  
polynomial is an over-fit; it has too many degrees of freedom \(in this case,  
11 parameters for 11 data points!\). We are in effect “fitting our model to  
noise” by using it. A model is said to *generalize* well if it performs well  
on data that it has *not* been trained on. In forecasting, we are looking  
for hypotheses and Johnson \[311\]\).  
then the simplest of is to be preferred \(Kotz *Estimation and Forecasting* 495  
for good generalization properties rather than good explanations of past  
data.  
Such overfitting problems come up during the model-selection phase  
for model-based methods and can be limited by considering only models  
that are “reasonable” from a subjective, business point of view, rather  
than trying blindly to find the best-fitting model based on past data.  
For neural networks, the problem is more subtle and difficult to detect.  
Because there is no explicit functional form that we choose—and because  
three-layer neural networks can approximate practically any function—  
the danger that we might overtrain and fit the network to noise is very  
high indeed. A good strategy to avoid overfitting is to keep a holdout  
sample and use the forecast errors on the holdout sample rather than on  
the training data to guide training. 496 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**9.5.2 Forecasting Errors and System Control**  
An analysis of the forecast errors is often as important as the forecast  
itself. Forecast error analysis is useful for the several reasons. First, the  
historical observed forecasting errors give a measure of the confidence  
one can have in the forecasting system or algorithm. Forecast errors can  
be used to estimate the variance in the underlying demand process and  
hence can be used to estimate second-order parameters of the distribu-  
tion. Errors can also be used to filter out outlier data. Finally, errors  
can be used to track the forecast and signal unusual events or instability  
in the system. We look at each of these applications below.  
# 9.5.2.1 Measures of Forecast Errors  
Suppose we have been running our forecasting system for *N* periods  
and have already constructed *N* forecasts and made observations of the  
forecast relative to the actual values on these *N* periods. Then the  
forecast error for a particular period is given by  
where is the observed value and is the forecasted value for period  
The following are some measures of forecast error that are used in  
practice\:  
# Sum of forecast errors\:  
# Mean error\:  
The mean error is an estimate of the forecast bias. If the forecasting  
system is unbiased, the mean bias should converge to 0 as *N* increases.  
**Smoothed error\:** This is given by the following recursive formula\:  
where is a smoothing constant.  
**Mean absolute deviation \(MAD\)**\: *Estimation and Forecasting* 497  
# Mean squared error \(MSE\)\:  
# Mean absolute percentage error \(MAPE\)\:  
The quantity is called the *relative error* and is not defined if  
is 0; hence the MAPE calculation should omit such values.  
# Tracking signal \(TS\)\:  
It is strongly recommended that at least one of MAD, MSE, or MAPE  
and the TS be used to monitor a forecasting system. The primary role  
of MAD, MSE, and MAPE measures is to evaluate the performance of  
the forecasting system. Lower numbers mean better forecasts.  
Among MAD, MSE and MAPE, the choice of which one to use de-  
pends strongly on the nature of the forecasts. MSE penalizes large errors  
for a single observation much more than MAD. Therefore, it is a better  
measure to detect if a few observations have large errors. If we are in-  
terested in overall performance, then MAD is generally a better choice.  
MAPE is useful for comparing performance across different time series,  
as the errors are measured relative to the data values.  
**9.5.2.2 Bias Detection and Correction**  
In addition to measuring forecast performance, a system should also  
monitor forecast bias. Tracking signal \(TS\) tests are used to monitor  
automated forecasts to see if the system is generating consistently biased  
forecasts. Typically, if the TS number exceeds a bound, an alert is  
generated for analysts to investigate. Most often in practice such bias is  
caused by a special, one-off event, but occasionally a recalibration may  
be required because of a fundamental change in the demand process.  
There are two common tests for detecting a systematic bias in the  
forecast from observed errors. First, assume that the forecast is mea-  
sured on a set of *N* observations. Let 498 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Then if the forecast is unbiased, the statistic has approximately a  
with degrees of freedom, where is the number of  
parameters in the model that are being estimated. \(See Abraham and  
Ledolter \[1\], p.372.\) For large *N,* is approximately a standard normal  
\(mean zero, variance one\) random variable. For a given significance  
level, a statistical test can then be devised with the null hypothesis that  
the forecast is unbiased.  
A second, more popular operational test for bias is to compare the  
absolute value of the tracking signal with a constant. \(See Mont-  
gomery \[388\].\) The forecasting system is declared biased if  
The constant is usually set to be between 4 and 6. Similar tests exist  
using variations of the tracking signal formula, one with smoothed error  
in the numerator of the TS definition and a constant between 0.2 and  
0.5 in the right-hand side of the bias test, and another where MSE is  
used instead of MAD in the denominator of the tracking signal formula  
and the constant in the bias test changed to be between 2 and 3.  
If one knows that the forecasting system has a bias, then it would  
appear trivial to fix the bias—just multiply or add a correction factor.  
Or better still, recalibrate the system or modify the forecasting algo-  
rithms; for instance, the forecast bias could be because of a bias in the  
estimation of the parameters of the model \(Section 9.2.1.3\). But this  
assumes we have a precise idea of the magnitude of the bias and that  
it is more or less constant. As for recalibrating the model, this is often  
an expensive process and can involve a considerable amount of research  
and experimentation to come up with a better \(unbiased\) estimate.  
**9.5.2.3 Outlier Detection and Correction**  
*Outliers* are extreme values of data that are caused by corrupted  
records or special nonrecurring conditions in the demand process.  
Outlier data can severely disrupt a forecasting system. Smoothing  
methods—like the moving-average method—are especially susceptible  
to outliers because the presence of an unusual data point will distort the  
forecasts for several successive periods.  
One technique to guard against outliers is to presmooth the data to  
make them more robust to the presence of outliers. The *moving-median*  
*smoothing* method in one example. Here the data is preprocessed by the  
following transformation\: *Estimation and Forecasting* 499  
and the forecast is trained as if were the real data sequence. This is an  
example of a nonlinear smoothing method. Many such nonlinear data  
smoothers exist. \(See Tukey \[520\].\) Care should be exercised, however,  
when the data has seasonality or other periodic effects. The data may  
first have to be deseasonalized before using such filters.  
Another technique is to try to identify and remove outliers before feed-  
ing the data to the forecasting system. One such outlier identification  
test is to consider a data point an outlier if  
where the value of is chosen to be between 5 and 6.  
**9.6 Industry Models of RM Estimation and**  
# Forecasting  
In this section we give some examples of specific RM forecasting mod-  
els. The models are intended to be representative of those used in a par-  
ticular industry to forecast a particular quantity of interest\: for example,  
no-shows, cancellations, and groups forecasting in the airline, rental-car,  
and hotel industries; ratings forecasting in the media industry; sales re-  
sponse functions in the retail industry; promotion effects forecasting for  
manufacturers; and load forecasting in the electricity and gas industries.  
Many variations of these models are possible, and the examples presented  
here are intended only as illustrations—not recommendations—of fore-  
casting approaches.  
**9.6.1 Airline No-Show and Cancellations**  
# Forecasting  
Forecasts of cancellation and show-up rates are key inputs to the over-  
booking module of an airline RM system. In addition to the statistical  
and operational techniques discussed in this chapter so far, this example  
also highlights the use of data-mining algorithms for forecasting.  
The first problem in cancellation forecasting is coping with reserva-  
tions data. If one uses only net-bookings data for forecasts—not un-  
common in RM systems—new bookings may hide cancellations. For  
instance, if in a period there are 100 bookings on hand, and during  
the period 20 new bookings are realized, but 10 current bookings cancel,  
then net-bookings data may make it appear that there have been 10 new  
bookings and 0 cancellations. Cancellation forecasts based on such data  
will then be biased. Similarly, go-shows or walk-ups—that is, people  
who show up without reservations \(distinguished from regular bookings  
by the fact that it is lumpy demand occurring at the time of service\)— 500 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
may also hide no-shows. So depending on the data being used and the  
requirements of the overbooking optimization, we may need to decide  
whether we are forecasting gross \(actual\) cancellations or net \(observed\)  
cancellations \(Figure 9.13\).  
Both no-show and cancellation rates can be defined at different levels  
of aggregation, for the entire cabin or by fare class. Defining rates by  
fare class is more accurate as significant differences may exist between  
fare classes—for example, some may have penalties for cancelling while  
others may not. Cancellations can also be defined over different inter-  
vals of time, as incremental cancellations over a given period or total  
cancellations over the entire booking period.  
Besides the level of aggregation, the cancellation rate and no-show  
rate can have different interpretations—\(1\) as the probability that a  
given individual booking will cancel or no-show or \(2\) as a fraction of  
the total number of bookings at a given point of time \(either current  
time or some time in the future\) that are likely to cancel or no-show.  
The second interpretation leads to the concept of a cancellation curve  
over the booking period. The cancellation rate may change over time  
as very early bookings tend to have higher cancellation rates than later  
ones \(see Figure 9.14\). A full cancellation curve is usually needed only  
in dynamic overbooking models.  
For illustration, consider the binomial model of Section 4.2.1. If there  
are *N* current bookings, the cancellation rate is the probability that  
a booking will cancel before the time of service. We define the no-show  
rate similarly. Both and are assumed to be constant and *Estimation and Forecasting* 501  
equal for all bookings, irrespective of when they booked. They can  
change over time but in a Markovian sense; they will depend only on  
the current time but not on the history of the bookings. We will also  
assume that the probabilities are independent of the number of current  
bookings \(this only determines the expected number of cancellations and  
no-shows by the Binomial distribution\).  
The simplest procedure for forecasting is to construct a time series  
of historical fractions who cancelled at a given point in time and use a  
standard forecasting method on this time series of data. For the case of  
cancellations, the series is constructed by taking  
Final bookings are bookings just before no-shows and go-shows are ac-  
counted for. Net no-shows are calculated as final bookings less final  
consumed inventory. If there are customers who are denied service, then  
they would be subtracted from the net no-shows.  
Net no-shows rate can be forecasted from the time series of his-  
torical no-show fractions. The fractions of no-shows and cancellations  
over time are calculated by dividing final consumed inventory and final  
bookings by the bookings on hand at each point of time. If the data is  
detailed enough to extract actual cancellations and no-shows \(as opposed  
to net cancellations and no-shows\), then these can be used to calculate  
a time-series forecast of the actual cancellation and no-show rates. 502 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
No-shows and cancellation forecasting can further be divided into two  
parts\: forecasting the cancellation behavior of customers who already  
booked and those who will book in the future. For the former, it is  
possible to exploit correlations between customer cancellation probabili-  
ties and purchase characteristics like time of booking, source of booking,  
amount paid, cancellation penalties, and refund policies associated with  
the fare, to improve the forecasts.  
Kalka and Weber \[280\], Feyen and Hüglin \[190\], and Westerhop \[561\]  
report airline no-show and cancellation forecasting for existing customers  
using data-mining and data-discovery tools on PNR data. Some of the  
attributes used are origin, destination, flight time, return trip, booking  
class, number of passengers traveling together, flight time, number of  
connections, and connection time. Feyen and Hüglin \[190\] use logistic  
regression on the attributes and the observed rates for prediction while  
Kalka and Weber \[280\] use induction trees. \(See Quinlan \[432\].\)  
The methodology in Kalka and Weber \[280\] can be illustrated in Fig-  
ure 9.15 for two attributes—flight time and booking class. The historical  
bookings and cancellations are mapped to the attribute space, and we  
partition the space by partitioning the ranges on the attributes. This is  
somewhat analogous to clustering points into groups, except that we are  
now interested in rules for partitioning each attribute dimension, rules  
that subsequently will be used to categorize new observations with its  
likelihood of cancellation. A cancellation probability is calculated for  
each box as the fraction of bookings in that box that cancel. For any  
new booking, its cancellation probability is derived by looking up the box  
it falls in and taking its corresponding cancellation probability. Data-  
mining tools use artificial intelligence rules-based techniques to partition  
the customer attribute space and construct an induction tree that gives  
a sequence of rules to be applied to classify observations.  
**9.6.2 Groups Demand and Utilization Forecasting**  
Bookings for units of five or more are usually classified as groups.  
Groups in RM can either be ad-hoc groups \(one-shot groups such as  
school excursions or crews\) or series groups \(repeating groups—for ex-  
ample, bookings by a package-tour operator\). \(See Sections 10.1.2  
and 10.2.1.\) In this section we describe the forecasting tasks associated  
with groups.  
Forecasting of group bookings demand is rarely done. This is because  
ad-hoc groups are such rare events that it makes it difficult to try to  
forecast demand from such sources. Series groups, on the other hand,  
are negotiated so far in advance that they make forecasting unnecessary. *Estimation and Forecasting* 503  
However, group-utilization forecasting is an important task. Group  
utilization is defined as the percentage of a group reservation that will  
eventually show up. In principle, it is no different from cancellations and  
no-show forecasting. However, it is treated separately because groups  
may act as a unit, with strong correlation between the members of the  
unit. For instance, a group may cancel as a whole, in which case there is  
a sudden lumpy change in the available capacity. Because of its potential  
impact on availability and the higher risk involved in groups canceling  
as a whole, group utilization is usually tracked separately from regular  
cancellations and no-shows by dedicated analysts or managers.  
Analysts also have better information about groups reservations than  
individual bookings because the reservation is usually made directly  
through personal contact. The source of a group reservation \(such as a  
tour operator, cruise-line or agency\) and type of group \(such as a corpo-  
rate meeting or convention\) also helps in tracking historical usage rates.  
Group utilization forecasting differs if the group is an ad-hoc group or  
a series group. Ad-hoc groups are more likely to cancel as a whole \(or  
not pay by the deadline\), while series groups, being negotiated contracts 504 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
for a long period, tend to survive till the usage date with only partial  
cancellations.  
A forecast of group utilization is made on a historical series of uti-  
lization ratios constructed for groups with similar characteristics \(same  
group type, group booking source, market, and so on\). The forecast  
is usually made for each individual group reservation and updated con-  
stantly as new information and confirmations come in. Causal models  
are widely used to forecast group reservations because of the rich data  
available specific to each individual group. Group utilizations have been  
found to be correlated with group type \(ad hoc or series\), origin loca-  
tion of bookings, group size, penalty costs, historic cancellations, book-  
ing source, time of booking, and group travel purpose, among others.  
Bayesian models are also suitable because they allow analysts’ beliefs on  
the group’s utilization to be incorporated into the forecast.  
**9.6.3 Sell-Up and Recapture Forecasting**  
Sell-up and recapture are used in some RM models as discussed in  
Section 2.6.12 The sell-up probability for a class is the probability that  
customers for that class will buy-up to at least one of the other higher  
classes \(of the same resource\) if their class is closed \(this is called *differ-*  
*ential sell-up rate* in Gorin \[217\]; the sell-up rate used in Belobaba and  
Weatherford \[37\] is only between the class and the next highest class\).  
Recapture occurs when the customer buys an alternative resource \(say,  
on a different date or time\) if their requested class is closed.  
There are several difficulties in estimating buy-up and recapture prob-  
abilities. For example, how do we tell if a customer is an “original”  
customer or a “recaptured” customer? Looking at transactional data  
alone, this is impossible to determine. It is common practice to pass  
this burden on to analysts, who are required to input buy-up and recap-  
ture probabilities for each market using their best judgment. Given the  
number of markets / resources / date combinations, often a single number  
is used for each market or for the firm as a whole.  
Other approaches are based on data. Gorin \[217\] proposes the fol-  
lowing formula for estimating the sell-up rate of a class for a resource\:  
Let represent total number bookings in class \(over a collection of  
sample historical data for the resource\). Assume the classes are indexed  
with the lower index having a higher fare. Then Gorin \[217\] defines the  
12 Andersson \[18\] defines a customers who neither sells-up nor is recaptured but buys an  
alternative product from a competitor, as a *deviation.* *Estimation and Forecasting* 505  
sell-up rate as  
However, he also states that this estimate likely is biased, so it should  
be used with caution. Recapture effects are not considered by Gorin.  
Consumer-choice models provide a more systematic approach to buy  
up and recapture estimation. An early attempt at such a model is by  
Maynes and Wood \[368\], who build an econometric model of demand for  
three latent market segments as a function of price, schedule attributes,  
and competitor prices and availability. The ratio of the forecasts of de-  
mand for a class on a resource and a lower fare class on the same resource  
provides the sell-up probability for the lower class. This approach can  
be extended to estimate recapture rate as well. However, these rates are  
calculated on a pairwise basis only, independent of what other options  
are available at that time.  
Andersson \[19\] presents a richer model of consumer behavior based on  
utilities and discrete-choice theory. At any given point of time, a choice  
set *S* is defined as a set of competing resource / class combinations for  
class on resource If is closed on then define as the set *S*  
without class on resource The estimate of the recapture rate is then  
defined as follows\:  
= Probability that resource class is chosen  
when is closed but all other choices in = Probability that resource class is chosen  
when all choices in *S* are open.  
Then the recapture rate by combination from denoted  
is defined as  
are open.  
The probabilities and can be estimated using an  
appropriate discrete-choice model. Andersson \[19\] \(see also Köhler \[308\]\)  
reports a study at Scandinavian Airlines where the choice probabilities  
were estimated using a MNL model fit from both transactional data and  
passenger surveys. The passenger surveys were in the form of games  
\(lasting around 10 minutes\), presenting alternatives of price, departure  
time, restrictions, and airline brand name.  
**9.6.4 Retail Sales Forecasting**  
Retail RM requires an estimate of a demand function. Besides price,  
advertising, product features, past sales, economic conditions, store lo-  
cation, brand effects, weather, and competitor actions are some factors 506 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
that strongly affect sales. Consequently, in retail marketing forecasts, in  
contrast to airline or hotel RM, causal models are widely used.  
As discussed in Chapter 7, there are two basic approaches to demand  
function modeling. One way of incorporating the effects of marketing  
variables on sales is through models of individual consumer choice behav-  
ior. Then in a bottom-up forecasting fashion, these individual choices  
are aggregated to get total demand. Another approach—called *aggre-*  
*gate forecasting*—is to model aggregate demand directly as a function of  
price and other marketing variables. We focus on this latter approach  
here, as it is prevalent both in marketing theory and practice, and as we  
covered discrete-choice models earlier.  
Let *Z* denote sales, and let the marketing variables be represented  
by for multivariate models and by for univariate models\:  
Consider a basic sales response model of the form  
The functional forms are usually designed such that either \(1\) absolute  
change in the marketing variables leads to an absolute change in sales  
or \(2\) percentage \(relative\) change in the marketing variables leads to  
an absolute change in sales. For instance, the function is of the  
former kind \(since while the function is the latter  
kind  
The function can be a *static* function of variables of the cur-  
rent period only, or a *dynamic* function capturing the effects of mar-  
keting variables in past periods \(for example, advertising done in the  
past month has an effect on the sales of this month\). Below are some  
examples of static sales response functions.  
# Semilogarithmic model\:  
Percentage sale in a marketing variable leads to an absolute change  
in the sales.  
# Multiplicative or power model\:  
The have the interpretation of elasticities. A more general form  
of \(9.70\) is called the *interactive* model and is given by the sum of all  
possible products of the variables\: *Estimation and Forecasting* 507  
It is rarely used in this full form.  
# Exponential model\:  
Sales exhibit increasing returns to scale as the value of the marketing  
variable \(say price\) goes down to zero. represents the maximum  
possible sales.  
# Log-reciprocal or S-shaped model\:  
This function possesses an inflection point at Sales show  
increasing marginal returns for less than the inflection point and  
decreasing marginal returns from then on.  
Other S-shaped curves are possible using *logistic* models such as the  
following *log-linear* and *double-log* models\:  
# Gutenberg model\:  
is a reference value for the marketing variable \(for instance aver-  
age competition price\). The Gutenberg model is a complicated but  
flexible function. Simon \[471\] gives an application using this model.  
Next we give some examples of dynamic sales response functions, in  
which the sales in a period is a function of variables of the past \(lagged\)  
periods, future \(lead\) customer actions or the current period\:  
**Geometric distributed-lag model\:** This is a dynamic model that  
relates the sales in period to observed values in previous periods  
with exponentially decreasing weights\: 508 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**SCAN\*PRO model\:** This is a widely used store-sales model \(pro-  
posed by Wittink et al. \[572\]\) for determining the effect of promotions  
on sales. Denote, for brand in store in period

Then the model is given by  
The and for each period have to be estimated from data.  
There are literally hundreds of models such as these studied by mar-  
keting scientists, with many empirically tested on real-world data. Once  
a model has been fixed, regression is the most common approach for  
estimating static models, while time-series methods \(Section 9.3.2\) are  
common for estimating dynamic models.  
**9.6.5 Media Forecasting**  
Forecasting for broadcast media presents some unique challenges.  
\(Media RM is discussed in detail in Chapter 10.\) Prices for adver-  
tising are quoted as cost per thousand impressions. For print and tele-  
vision firms, the circulation and ratings determine how much the firm  
can charge for their advertisement space. Internet media rates are based  
on page-views or click-through metrics. Market-research firms such as  
Nielsen, IRI, and Media Metrix are dedicated to measuring the size of  
the circulation \(print\), page-views \(Internet\) and audience \(television,  
radio\).  
A broadcaster faces two main forecasting tasks. One is to forecast  
ratings for shows by day-of-week and season; the other is to forecast  
demand for advertising slots for these shows. Forecasting the latter is  
usually much easier than the former because the network has knowledge  
of its customers—their historical preferences and buying patterns, re-  
quired demographics, and in many cases, even their advertising budget.  
A forecast of demand is first constructed by making an estimate of each *Estimation and Forecasting* 509  
customer’s demand \(often manual, based on last year’s demand\) and  
then making a tentative sales plan satisfying the customer’s preferences  
based on the ratings forecasts \(Bollapragada et al. \[83\]\). In this section,  
we concentrate on ratings forecasts, which is a good example of a rather  
difficult causal forecasting problem.  
Few TV or radio managers rely on formal ratings forecasting models  
for their own programming decisions; surveys, gut feeling, and innate  
programming intuition seem to be the dominant methodologies in prac-  
tice. These forecasts, though often subjective, can be helpful for RM  
purposes as well, as they reflect managerial judgment \(for instance, they  
can be used to form priors in a Bayesian framework\).  
Recently, several methods have been proposed based on formal models  
of consumer viewing behavior. Television viewing habits are conceptu-  
alized as a two-stage process. In the first stage, the individual decides  
whether or not to watch TV. This leads to a forecast of the total ag-  
gregate TV viewing population at any given time. Once a decision to  
watch TV is made, the individual chooses one of the available programs,  
which leads to show-level ratings. \(See Gensch and Shaman \[206\].\) This  
two-stage model suggests using a time-series model to predict aggre-  
gate viewership by time and day of week based on recent programming  
data, and then a discrete-choice model to predict ratings by show. Past  
viewership, viewing time, seasonality, and regional differences are good  
predictors of aggregate viewership, while the show characteristics, slot,  
show-promotion, lead-ins \(the popularity of the program before\) and  
lead-outs \(and the program that runs after\) influence the market share  
of a show.  
For example, Reddy, Aronson, and Stam \[437\] building on the work  
of Horen \[257\], use a regression model to predict the ratings of TV  
shows running for multiple seasons and hence with some historical data.  
Shows are classified into homogeneous types, based on their character-  
istics \(movie, news, afternoon talk show\). The model is\:  
with the following variable definitions, 510 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*

of show of type \(managerial rating from 0 to 10\)

**9.6.6 Gas-Load Forecasting**  
We next look briefly at a gas-load forecasting system using neural-  
network methods, reported to be implemented at Williams Gas \(Lamb  
and Logue \[327\]\). The model forecasts short-term \(between one to five  
days ahead\) demand for gas in a pipeline. The pipeline has thousands  
of meters drawing gas from it, each with variable demand. The factors  
that affect this demand were identified as  
Weather parameters \(such as temperature, humidity, wind direction,  
and so on supplied by weather data vendors\) *Estimation and Forecasting* 511

**9.7 Notes and Sources**  
We have given many reference in the text of the chapter. Here we  
gather some general references on the topics of the chapter along with  
some additional pointers.  
Regression-related topics can be found in any advanced statistic or  
econometric books. Here are some references\: DeGroot \[151\] and  
Kvanli \[318\] for introductory statistics; Maddala \[353\], Greene \[220\],  
and Judge et al. \[273\] for econometrics. Some books devoted exclusively  
to regression are Draper and Smith \[161\], Guttman \[231\], and Neter and  
Wasserman \[403\].  
Books on forecasting are available at all levels. We recommend Mont-  
gomery et al. \[388\] for a general introduction to operational forecast-  
ing and Harvey \[242, 243\] for a more advanced treatment of time-series  
analysis and Kalman filtering.  
For books on neural networks, we recommend Bishop \[69\] for a very  
readable yet rigorous introduction to neural networks \(albeit for pat-  
tern recognition\) Our treatment follows also Müller, Reinhardt, and  
Strickland \[397\]. Some useful survey papers on the use of neural net-  
works in forecasting are Poli and Jones \[423\], Cheng and Tittering-  
ton \[110\], Zhang, Patuwo, and Hu \[588\], Hill, Marquez, O’Connor, and  
Remus \[252\], Hill, O’Connor, and Remus \[253\]. The application of neural  
networks to predict consumer choice can be found in West, Brockett, and  
Golden \[562\] and Dasgupta, Dispensa and Ghose \[144\].  
For estimation of price-response functions and market-share mod-  
els, see the following marketing science text books\: Eliashberg and  
Lilien \[174\], Wedel and Kamakura \[558\], Hanssens, Parsons, and Schultz  
\[235\], Cooper and Nakanishi \[127\], Dasgupta, Dispensa, and Ghose \[144\],  
Hruska \[259\], West, Brockett, and Golden \[562\], Hill et al. \[253\], Zhang  
\[588\], and Lee et al. \[335\]. Kalyanam \[283\] proposes a Bayesian mixture  
model of pricing specifications when there is no consensus on the right  
model.

timation in a competitive market similar to the method described in  
Example 9.9. The problem of endogenity in estimation has received  
much recent attention in the marketing science literature spurred by  
the paper of Berry \[53\]. See also Chintagunta, Kadiyali and Vilcas-  
sim \[116\] and Villas-Boas and Winer \[536\] for further studies on en-  
dogeneity. Nevo \[406\] gives an excellent practical guide to estimating  
random-coefficient logit models of demand.  
The Bayesian method of updating of parameters can be incorporated  
into many of the time-series methods of Section 9.3.2 also in a fairly  
straightforward manner. \(See, for instance, Montgomery et al. \[388\].\)  
The empirical Bayes method that we cover in this chapter is not the only  
possibility for handling hierarchical Bayes methods. See Lindley and  
Smith \[345\] and Blattberg and George \[75\] for alternatives. Hierarchical  
Bayes methods have also found application in modeling heterogeneity in  
preferences in discrete-choice models \(Albert and Chib \[6\]; Allenby and  
Rossi \[11\]; Huber and Train \[260\]\), and in conjoint analysis \(Allenby and  
Ginter \[9\]; Lenk et al. \[339\]\).  
Literature on combining forecasts is also quite vast, given its promise  
of returning more than the sum of its parts. The standard references in  
this area are Newbold and Granger \[407\], Granger and Newbold \[218\],  
Makridakis and Winkler \[356\], Clemen and Winkler \[122\], Clemen \[123\],  
Gupta and Wilson \[230\], Schmittlein, Kimm, and Morrison \[457\], Mor-  
rison and Schmittlein \[391\], and Foster and Vohra \[192\]. See also Mont-  
gomery et al. \(\[388\], p.192\).  
One of the few textbooks dedicated to the EM algorithm is McLach-  
lan and Krishnan \[377\]. The book also contains many applications,  
convergence properties and lists a large number of EM references. Con-  
nections with the Gibbs method is mentioned, but the reader should  
refer to Schafer \[456\] dedicated to MCMC methods. For an introduc-  
tion to Gibbs Sampling, see the article of Casella and George \[101\] and  
Gilks, Richardson and Spiegelhalter \[212\]. For Gibbs algorithm applied  
to missing-data problems, see Gelfand, Smith and Lee \[203\].  
Both the origins of EM and Gibbs sampling \(at least their ideas\)  
can be traced far back, but Dempster et al. \[152\] and Geman and Ge-  
man \[205\] are credited with their invention and popularization.  
The original paper of Kaplan and Meier \[289\] is still a good introduc-  
tion to the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Many books on survival analysis  
\(Miller \[383\]; Cox and Oakes \[134\]\) also describe the method in detail.  
Logistic regression has been proposed as a parametric alternative to the  
Kaplan-Meier curve, with good properties and flexibility, and with all  
the advantages of a parametric form \(Efron \[173\]\). *APPENDIX 9.A\: Back-Propagation Algorithm for Neural-Network Training*513  
The unconstraining methods described here are not the only alterna-  
tives though. It is possible to use the bootstrap, jackknife as well as  
regression with censored data to get estimates of the parameters of a  
censored sample. See Efron \[171\] and Davison and Hinckley \[148\] for  
an introduction to using bootstrap for unconstraining and for regression  
with censored data.

We illustrate the back-propagation algorithm for training a neural network on our  
example of Figure 9.9.  
Because we chose the linear function as the activation function for input  
and output nodes, we represent, by a slight abuse of notation, the instance of  
an input and its corresponding output of the neural net as and  
respectively. As always, let be the actual observation at the  
instance. Assume we are given a set of *N* training data instances \(a set of *N*

# INDUSTRY PROFILES  
Implementing revenue management requires an understanding of real  
world market conditions. Regulations, technology standards, consumer  
behavior, product characteristics, pricing policies, and industry distri-  
bution practices are all important factors that affect the way RM is  
practiced. This chapter explores these institutional factors affecting RM  
in industries that are both mature and emerging users of RM. For each  
industry we begin by describing its products, consumers, and pricing  
practices. We then summarize the current state of RM in the indus-  
try and the key issues affecting its RM practices. Our progression is  
from industries in which RM is a mature practice to those in which it a  
relatively new or emerging practice.  
A word of caution is in order here, however. Industry practices can  
change rapidly as new technologies and business models emerge, and  
such changes can fundamentally alter the way RM is practiced. Conse-  
quently, this chapter represents at best a snapshot of current RM prac-  
tice. Continuing innovations in business models and technologies will no  
doubt keep RM an evolving discipline for many years to come.  
**10.1 Airlines**  
As the earliest and largest user of RM, the airline industry deserves  
special attention. Hence, we begin our industry discussion with an in-  
depth look at RM practices in the airline industry.  
**10.1.1 History**As mentioned in Chapter 1, RM has its origins in the rise of capacity-  
controlled discount fares after the deregulation of the U.S. airline indus- 516 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
try. Before deregulation, the only service options offered by commercial  
airlines were first-class and coach-class service. Fares on a route were  
identical for all carriers and set by the Civil Aeronautics Board \(or by the  
International Air Transport Association \(IATA\) on international flights\)  
based on standard costs.  
The first innovation in fare structures occurred in international mar-  
kets with the development of APEX—*advance-purchase excursion*—fares.  
APEX fares offered travelers the option of buying a coach-class seat at a  
discount but were restricted to round-trip travel and required an advance  
purchase and a minimum stay.  
The period after deregulation in the United States was character-  
ized by successive innovations in creating discounted products. As dis-  
cussed in Chapter 1, American Airlines introduced “Super Saver” fares  
in 1975. These fares had a seven-day advance-purchase requirement  
and minimum-stay conditions and required round-trip travel. Advance-  
purchase restrictions were lengthened progressively over the years, culmi-  
nating in 1985 with American Airlines’ introduction of “Ultimate Super  
Saver” fares that required a 30-day advance purchase. In 1987, Texas  
Air Corporation introduced a “Max Saver” fares that had the further re-  
striction of being non-refundable. The practice of limiting refundability  
\(or imposing cancellation or change-of-itinerary fees\) became an indus-  
trywide practice shortly thereafter. In the mid-1980s, airlines introduced  
Saturday-night stay requirements to further prevent business travelers  
from buying discounted products.  
Today, most airlines offer discounts based on a relatively stable set of  
restrictions, typically a combination of advance-purchase restrictions of  
7, 14, 21, and 30 days, the requirement to stay a Saturday night, non-  
refundability, and penalties for changes in the itinerary after purchase.  
The low-cost carriers, which concentrate primarily on the leisure market,  
use primarily advance-purchase discounts and change penalties.  
**10.1.2 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
Airlines serve a wide range of customers, both individual travelers  
as well as groups. The classic segmentation of individual travelers is  
between business and leisure customers.  
Those traveling for business purposes have strong time preferences.  
They thus tend to value schedule convenience and booking/cancellation  
flexibility and are considered relatively price-insensitive, because, in  
most cases, their travel expenses are paid by their employers or charged  
to clients.  
Leisure travelers, on the other hand, tend to be more sensitive to price  
because they are paying from their own pockets. However, because they *Industry Profiles* 517  
are traveling for discretionary purposes, they tend to have more flexi-  
bility in their travel dates and will modify their schedule to find a good  
deal. They are also willing, and even prefer sometimes, to precommit to  
travel many days ahead of departure.  
The two segments differ also in their travel-time preference, with busi-  
ness travelers preferring to leave on weekdays and return by the weekend,  
and leisure travelers preferring to depart at the end of the week and stay  
over a weekend. Leisure travel peaks around major holidays, while busi-  
ness travel drops at these points in time.  
Of course, this is at best a crude description of the behavior of the  
many customer segments an airline serves. Some leisure travelers with  
high disposable incomes are more sensitive to schedule convenience and  
in-flight amenities than they are to price. Many business travelers are  
as price-sensitive as leisure customers \(for example, those who are self-  
employed\). Business travelers sometimes travel over the weekend, and  
leisure travelers often need to travel midweek. Some business travelers  
can easily commit to an advance reservation with no refund, while some  
leisure customers decide to travel at the last minute. Therefore, in gen-  
eral, there are many variations in preferences for schedules, routings,  
and in-flight service among travelers, and there are many differences in  
their ability to plan and commit to their travel plans.  
Besides individual travelers, airlines also serve various wholesale travel  
groups. For example, cruise lines will often book blocks of seats connect-  
ing to their various sailings for packaged holidays. Tour operators also  
purchase blocks of seats to offer as part of combined air-hotel packages.  
Airline sales can also be classified by sales channel. Travel agencies  
have long been the dominant sale channel, but Internet sales \(either  
own-website sales or third-party travel sites\) are rapidly growing in im-  
portance. Consolidators and wholesalers are two other significant sales  
channels in many airline markets.  
All these differences in sales channels, customer types, and behavior  
affect RM and are targeted by various airline products, as explained  
below.  
**10.1.2.1 Itineraries and Combinability Rules**  
Airline products are itineraries \(seats on a routing on a date and  
time in the future\) on its network of flights. An itinerary may involve  
multiple connections.1 Because of the many connection possibilities, an  
airline with 500 flights a day may offer hundreds of thousands of possi-  
1Most full-service carriers have significant network traffic. The newer low-cost carriers deal  
exclusively in point-to-point service and do not offer connections. 518 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
ble itineraries for sale. Added to this complexity, airlines offer different  
compartments of service \(first, business, coach\), and within each com-  
partment, multiple fare products with different rules and restrictions—  
all offered for travel up to a year in the future. Prices are set at the level  
of itinerary, date of travel, fare product, and point of sale—requiring  
hundreds of thousands of products to be priced regularly.  
Because of the immense number of combinations involved, airlines  
post prices for only a fraction of their itineraries. They then define  
rules on how these simpler fares can be combined \(so-called *combinabil-*  
*ity rules*\)*.* Another pricing method—called *constructed fares*—involves  
specifying a base fare between regions \(such as Spain to North America\)  
and then defining add-on charges based on specific origins and destina-  
tions \(for example, Spain-Chicago, +30 Euros\). It is the responsibility  
of the reservation system and the travel agent to follow these combin-  
ability and fare-construction rules, interpret them properly, and charge  
customers the correct fare.  
**10.1.2.2 Interlining**  
An itinerary can also consist of flights involving several airlines \(called  
*interlining*\)*.* The price for interline flights depends on the agreements  
between the two carriers. The revenue is then split by a mutual proration  
agreement or, lacking such an agreement, by IATA-specified guidelines.  
The prorated revenue settlement is most often done by agencies dedi-  
cated to this task, which introduces significant delays in even accounting  
for revenue.  
**10.1.2.3 Pricing Itineraries**  
Even if all flights are on a single airline, pricing an itinerary is com-  
plicated by the fact that there are often many different ways to do so.  
Figure 10.1 shows an example of an itinerary and some ways of pricing it  
as a combination of one-ways, round-trips, open-jaws and one-ways with  
stopovers, and so on. A pricing solution is made up of these components.  
For each one of these components, in turn, there are many possible fare  
products. Each fare product has its own rules and restrictions attached  
to it. If a passenger qualifies for all the restrictions *and* all the com-  
binability rules are satisfied *and* the airline reservation system indicates  
that the booking classes for the desired fares on *all* the legs are open,  
then the agent can book the itinerary. The rules indicate conditions on  
the amount of time available for purchase, the cancellation penalties,  
and so forth, and footnotes indicate exceptions and clauses. This rule  
and footnote interpretation is complicated, with sequential sets of logical  
clauses specified at one or more levels \(such as flight level, geographic *Industry Profiles* 519  
level and periods of application\). Indeed, the industry at present time  
has more than thirty categories of rules, restrictions, and footnotes. As  
a result, an itinerary such as the one shown in Figure 10.1 can have  
several thousand possibilities for pricing.  
A travel agent or GDS searches among the valid combinations \(usu-  
ally to find the cheapest\). However, because of the large number of  
possible combinations involved and the difficulty in interpreting the com-  
binability and footnote rules, even automated systems sometimes miss 520 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
the lowest possible price. This is one reason that one travel agent can  
sometimes produce a lower price than another. Web-based price search  
engines \(e.g., Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity\) also show differences in their  
ability to search these combinations correctly and find the best price, as  
their performance depends on the quality of the rules interpretation code  
and the number of combinations priced.  
**10.1.2.4 Managing Prices**  
Prices are distributed through two agencies, ATPCO and SITA.2 AT-  
PCO \(Airline Tariff Publishing Company\) is an industry organization  
that aggregates fares and rules from a large number of airlines and dis-  
tributes them to GDSs. Anyone can subscribe to its service for a fee.  
Distribution is electronic with different frequency of downloads that can  
be restricted by filters to reduce the volume of data. A change service  
sends new and changed fares only, by market and region.  
Airline pricing departments price their fare products by monitoring  
competitors’ prices and their own traffic data. Airline analysts closely  
monitor competitor price changes. Pricing departments respond to com-  
petitors’ price moves very quickly, often filing a response on the same  
day.  
Fares available for such public distribution are called *public fares.*  
However, in addition to public fares, airlines offer a large number of *pri-*  
*vate fares.* Private fares are discounts or special rates given to important  
travel agencies, wholesalers, and corporations. They are not revealed to  
the public \(or competition\) and are available only by corporate agree-  
ments or qualified agents. In some international markets, private fares  
constitute 90% of sales, though in Europe and the United States, they  
are a smaller fraction of total sales. Private fares are sometimes sold  
via GDSs \(a special code is required to access them\), though many are  
off line paper agreements. Field sales agents monitor these private fares  
and send intelligence back to the airline when possible, though pricing  
analysts usually have only a vague idea of the private fares offered by  
competitors.  
**10.1.2.5 Priceline.com and Internet-Only Fares**  
The Internet has opened up a new sales channel for airline tickets  
with its own fare structure and sale practices. Many airlines use their  
websites to make last minute fares available at very low prices, a tactic  
2Schedule information is distributed mainly by another organization called the Official Airline  
Guide \(OAG\). *Industry Profiles* 521  
little used previously. These fares are not advertised ahead of time and  
are usually not sold through any other channel.  
Intermediaries, such as Priceline.com and Hotwire.com, have also cre-  
ated new channels and pricing mechanisms in the U.S. airline industry,  
and similar sites have emerged in other countries. Priceline.com defines  
its process as a “buyer-driven commerce,” and it has many similari-  
ties with reverse auctions \(see Section 6.1.2\). A customer specifies an  
itinerary and a price they are willing to pay. The request is a commit-  
ment by the customer to buy at the offered price; if an airline accepts  
the offer, the flight is booked and the customer is charged. However,  
customers must accept considerable uncertainty over the details of their  
itinerary, including not knowing the airline they will fly, the number  
of connections it will have, or the exact time of arrival and departure.  
Moreover, they cannot change or cancel the booking once it is made.  
Customers can also buy only economy, round-trip tickets and cannot  
use frequent-flyer points.  
Once a request is made, the Priceline.com system searches for an  
airline willing to sell below that price and sends an accept /reject decision  
back to the customer within 15 minutes. Priceline.com keeps the margin  
between the customer-quoted price and the airline price.  
The Priceline.com mechanism is designed to appeal to price-conscious  
customers who are flexible about their travel times and routings. The  
deliberate uncertainty introduced into the transaction \(in airline, arrival  
time, routing\) makes it unattractive for most business travelers \(and  
many leisure travelers as well\). The fact that the airline’s identity is un-  
certain also offers *brand shielding,* allowing airlines to discount without  
making the discounts widely known, thus limiting the threat to their  
main channels of distribution. \(For these reasons, such fares are called  
*opaque fares* in the industry.\)  
Several airlines have also started similar sale procedures on their own  
websites, combining them with regular sales and last minute, Internet-  
only offers and posted-price offers.  
**10.1.3 RM Practice**  
Since the practice of RM in the airline industry is quite mature, several  
standard practices have developed. Here we summarize and discuss these  
practices.  
**10.1.3.1 Fare Classes and Fare Basis**  
RM systems for airlines book reservations in fare classes \(or *booking*  
*classes*\)*.* Each compartment \(first, business, and coach\) has a number of 522 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
fare classes—typically eight or more for coach, one or two for business,  
and one or two for first. These booking classes are represented by letters;  
some industry-standard booking classes are F for first-class, J and C for  
business class, Y for full-fare coach with no restrictions, and M, B, K,  
H, Q, Z, and others for the discounted fare classes in coach. The exact  
codes used for the classes vary from airline to airline.  
Each fare class is used to book tickets sold under different *fare codes*  
or *fare-basis codes.* Each of these fare-basis codes \(with names such  
as “QXE30”\) have specific fares associated with them, and the main  
requirements for booking under that fare basis code is encoded \(some-  
what cryptically\) into the name of the fare code. For example, the 30 in  
QXE30 represents a 30-day advance-purchase requirement. Table 10.1  
gives an example of fare codes and their mappings to booking classes  
and restrictions. The primary reason for grouping fare-basis codes into  
fare classes is that many reservation systems can accommodate only a  
relatively small number of fare classes \(typically five to eight\) per cabin.  
Thus, grouping fare codes into fare classes allows an airline the flexibil-  
ity to post a wide range of fares yet control their availability through a  
smaller number of fare classes.  
**10.1.3.2 Booking Processes and Availability**  
Airlines start selling seats on flights up to a year before departure.  
However, since flight schedules are usually not finalized until three months  
prior to the departure date, most bookings that are made very early on  
are tentative, consisting mostly of group bookings by tour operators.  
Most regular fare class bookings come in during the last two or three  
months before departure. Typically leisure passengers book earlier than *Industry Profiles* 523  
business passengers and the restrictions imposed on the cheaper fare  
classes try to exploit this preference of business passengers to book late.  
A typical booking process proceeds as follows. An airline posts avail-  
ability in each fare class to the reservation systems stating the availability  
of seats in each fare class. This is done using codes such as Flight 314\:  
Y4 M4 BO ..., a notation that indicates up to four seats are available  
in Y class, four in M class, and zero in B \(put another way, Y and M  
are open, B is closed\). When a customer requests an itinerary, a travel  
agent retrieves this availability information from the GDS. If a fare class  
is open, the travel agent is allowed to make a booking in that fare class.  
Within a fare class the agent quotes a fare for the itinerary based on one  
of the fare codes. The fare code is then recorded under the passenger  
name record \(PNR\).  
Booking data are also grouped based on fare classes rather than fare  
codes for forecasting purposes in most RM systems. This aggregation  
often makes it difficult to precisely estimate demand and revenues from  
historical data.  
**10.1.3.3 Global Distribution Systems \(GDSs\)**  
A *global distribution systems* \(GDS\) provides centralized control and  
distribution of bookings. There are a number of GDSs currently in op-  
eration worldwide \(see Table 11.5\). The operation of these GDSs is  
governed by regulations intended to prevent the host airline or airlines  
from biasing the display to their advantage, though there has been con-  
siderable controversy surrounding “display bias” over the years.  
GDSs communicate with the host reservation system of each airline to  
periodically obtain availability information. A travel agency subscribes  
to a GDS and makes bookings through it. The GDS in turn sends  
messages to the host reservation system of each airline involved in the  
itinerary of a given booking. Airlines are charged a fee for each one of  
these GDS booking transactions.  
When the host reservation system of an airline closes a booking class,  
it sends a message to all GDSs indicating that a particular class on a par-  
ticular flight is closed. The GDSs in turn display the new availabilities  
to travel agents’ queries. The communication requirements between the  
travel agent, GDS, and the host reservation system are very demanding,  
usually requiring that the connect and transaction be completed in a  
second or less. A few million transactions are processed by the GDSs  
each day.  
For competitive purposes, so as not to reveal their inventory decisions  
to competing airlines, airlines do not reveal their complete availability  
information to GDSs. For example, an airline may post an availability 524 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
of Y4 to a GDS; meaning four seats are authorized for sale in Y class,  
even though there may be 50 seats remaining on the flight.  
**10.2 Hotels**  
The hotel industry is another industry in which RM is well estab-  
lished. Hotels are categorized as business, extended-stay, resorts, or a  
mix of business and leisure and also by size \(large, small\) and location  
\(airport, urban, central business district or CBD, highway, beach\). Ho-  
tels may be managed by independent owners, as part of a chain that  
is managed directly by employees of a single corporation, or as part of  
a franchise. Some hotel companies manage only individual properties,  
while large hotel chains can own thousands of properties under multiple  
brand names. Chains sometime manage a property without taking own-  
ership. This diversity in the types and operations of hotels means RM  
practices in the industry also vary quite a bit.  
**10.2.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
Like airlines, hotels have both individual and group customer seg-  
ments. Free individual travelers *\(FITs\),* are guests who book their own  
rooms, whether for business or leisure. Some FIT segments include  
corporate, long-stay guests \(those who stay greater than one week\), in-  
dividual vacation packages marketed by the hotel itself \(such as honey-  
moon or golf\), weekend packages, and walk-in customers. In addition  
to FITs, hotels receive demand for single rooms from travel packages  
sold by travel agencies or airlines. The groups segment is made up of  
tour groups, conference groups, incentive groups \(such as salesforce re-  
ward parties\), ad-hoc groups \(an excursion group\), and recurring groups  
\(airline crew, cruise-line\).  
However, despite some of the similarity with airline customer types,  
the segmentation mechanisms used in hotel RM are somewhat different  
from those used by the airlines. For example, advance-purchase dis-  
counts, a prominent segmentation mechanism of airlines, are not that  
commonly used by hotels. The equivalent of the Saturday-night-stay re-  
striction of airlines—intended to restrict access for business customers—  
is the weekend rate, applicable only for stays on Friday and Saturday  
nights.  
**10.2.1.1 Room Revenues**  
Rooms are the primary source of revenue in most hotels, but hotels  
also generate significant revenues from secondary sources such as food  
and beverage sales, function space, activities \(golf, ski, entertainment\), *Industry Profiles* 525  
and gambling \(in the case of casinos\). For this reason, the value of a  
customer to the hotel may be hard to determine exactly. For example,  
a customer’s restaurant spending for food and beverages is uncertain at  
the time of booking. Table 10.2 summarizes the typical revenue sources  
for a hotel. Despite their importance to customer profitability, these  
additional sources of revenue are often not accounted for in hotel RM  
systems, though some RM systems do work with the average *net* revenue  
for each rate product.  
**10.2.1.2 Room Types**  
The rooms of a hotel are usually classified into several *room types* with  
up to 40 room types, each with a potentially different rate. Some exam-  
ples of room types are presidential suites, suites, deluxe rooms, business-  
floor rooms, standard rooms, executive rooms, lower-floor rooms, prefer-  
ential rooms and room with a view. Other classifications include smoking  
or nonsmoking rooms, and single or double bed, with small differences  
in prices between these classifications.  
Even though there can be many different room types, they are nor-  
mally grouped together into three or four categories for capacity-control  
purposes. For example, the classification may be reduced to suites, busi-  
ness rooms, and standard rooms, equivalent to airline compartments.  
There is normally a gradation of rates in these categories and a large  
difference in the average rate between categories. The rates for each  
room type are again grouped together into only a few classes for RM  
purposes.  
**10.2.1.3 Room Rates**  
Rates start off with what is called a *rack rate*—or the *published rate*—  
which is the highest rate for a given room type \(equivalent to Y for the  
coach class in airlines\). Rates go down as a percentage off the rack rate.  
The rates are usually referred to as 90%, or 80% \(off rack\).  
A customer can qualify for a particular rate based on his affiliation  
\(company, government, diplomats\), membership \(automobile clubs such  
as AAA\), or individually negotiated discounts. Travel agencies negoti-  
ate discounted rates, called wholesaler’s rates, which can be lower than  
corporate rates. Even these *wholesalers’ rates* vary significantly from  
one vendor to another. It is not unusual for a large hotel to end up with  
up to 150 rates. The rates are usually adjusted only once or twice a  
year. Hotels typically aggregate both the rates and the customer types,  
leading to about 10 to 12 *rate bands* \(or classes\) for inventory control.  
Pricing for a multiresource inventory \(multinight stay request\) for  
hotels is almost universally taken as the sum of the daily rates. This is 526 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
in contrast to airline pricing where the fares of a multileg itinerary have  
little to do with the prices on the individual segments. This difference  
arises because a multinight stay does not constitute a different “market”  
per se, whereas in the airline industry different itineraries serve quite  
distinct geographical markets with potentially very different levels of  
competition. The only exception to this simple way of pricing multiday  
stays is when a hotel offers one or two nights free for longer stays \(akin  
to a volume discount\).  
**10.2.2 RM Practice**  
As mentioned, hotel RM practices tend to exhibit greater variation  
than airline RM practices, mainly due to the more fragmented nature of  
the industry. Still, one can identify common elements. *Industry Profiles* 527  
**10.2.2.1 Booking Process**  
In a typical large hotel, approximately 60 to 80% of bookings are made  
directly with the hotel, either locally, through the Internet, or through  
a centralized call center. The remaining bookings come from GDSs.3  
Customer bookings arrive anywhere from one to 18 months in ad-  
vance. However, a large part of the reservation activity—at least corpo-  
rate and transient bookings—happens during the last few days preced-  
ing the room-usage date. Reservations may or may not be guaranteed  
by credit card, though this practice varies by region and country. Not  
surprisingly, cancellation rates are quite different when reservations are  
guaranteed by a credit card versus when they are not guaranteed.  
Hotels typically follow one of two distinct policies with respect to rate  
quotations. One policy is for the reservation agent to quote the “best-  
available rate”; the second is to use a “top-down” quotation policy, where  
the quote starts with the higher rates and the agent in essence “bargains  
down” the rate depending on the customer response, by offering different  
room types or packages. This latter policy is partly due to the richer  
variety of the inventory in hotel products and can be considered a type  
of information discovery mechanism between the agent and customer.  
However, the practice of negotiating rates, which is a rather unpleasant  
experience to many customers, is declining with the increased use of  
Internet booking engines where the norm is to offer a menu of available  
rooms and packages and customers self-select the class and room-type  
combination.  
Corporate bookings in many hotels follow a somewhat different process.  
If the request is turned away because that corresponding class is closed,  
then reservation agents typically attempt to sell a higher room cate-  
gory, rather than quote a higher rate for the requested category. This  
is normally because of contractual restrictions between the hotel and  
the corporation or wholesaler. Some corporate contracts guarantee last-  
room availability, which ensures the customer can book a room if one is  
physically available.  
**10.2.2.2 Property Management Systems \(PMS\)**  
Hotel reservations are controlled by a *property management system*  
*\(PMS\)* that automates the flow of the vast information required in the  
operation of a hotel.  
3The Hotel Electronic Distribution Network Association \(HEDNA\) reported that in 1999 the  
GDSs delivered over 43 million bookings for hotels, with a value in excess of \$12.5 billion \[96\]. 528 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT* *Industry Profiles* 529  
The PMS records many transactions, like meal and beverage sales,  
in real time, and many others, like arrival updates and billing, in batch  
mode at night. In addition, the PMS controls many other functions such  
as accounting, billing, employee records, security, and supplies inventory  
and ordering. The features of a modern PMS are given in Table 10.2.  
The PMS is usually linked to external GDSs or, for a hotel chain, to  
a hotel’s own corporate reservation system. Most of the principal GDSs,  
as well as many travel and tourism Internet sites, list hotels with live  
\(seamless\) connections either to the hotel-chain reservation system or  
directly to the hotel PMSs. The GDSs list room types and attributes  
\(bed type\) and typically store only the rack rate and one or two discounts  
below the rack rate. Therefore, GDS bookings come only in a relatively  
limited number of classes.  
The PMS communicates with a GDS through a *consolidating system*  
\(belonging to so-called *switch companies\).* The two leading consolidat-  
ing systems belong to Pegasus \(formerly THISCO—The Hotel Industry  
Switch Company\) and WizCom \(owned by Cendent Corp. and previ-  
ously owned by Avis Rental Car Company\). These consolidating systems  
broadcast the PMS availability message to the major GDSs and also con-  
solidate the GDSs’ booking messages. As a result, the communication  
between PMSs and GDSs is not instantaneous, but the systems are mov-  
ing toward a query-reply mode.4 Hotels have to pay a fee for each book-  
ing through a GDS \(approximately \$4.50\), the switch company \(approx-  
imately \$0.45\), and also a commission to the hotel chain / representative  
\(if applicable\). In addition, frequent-flier costs \(about \$8 to \$9 per book-  
ing\) and travel-agent fees \(about 10% of revenues\), reduce the revenue  
received for a room.  
**10.2.2.3 Overbooking and Cancellations**  
No-show rates in hotels range from 7% to 20% depending on the rate  
category. Cancellations and no-show depend on time of booking \(later  
bookings tend not to no-show\), credit card guarantees, whether the room  
is being shared, and so on. A cancellation happens not only when the  
customer calls to cancel but also if the customer decides to check out  
early. This means that the future capacity of the hotel is often uncertain.  
Overbooking is widely practiced in the hotel industry. The hotel  
equivalent of an airline denied-boarding is when a customer is “walked”  
to another hotel. In general, hotels are conservative in overbooking, and  
walking a customer is a relatively rare event. Sometimes hotels walk a  
4See the discussion of seamless availability in Section 11.2.3.2. Many GDSs today have this  
capability. 530 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
“less valuable” customer \(a one-night stay guest\) even when a room is  
available, to avoid walking a “more valuable” customer \(long-stay guest\)  
who is slated to arrive later. Aggregate supply and demand in the lo-  
cality is taken into consideration when setting overbooking limits. For  
example, if there is a convention or festival in the city and all the sur-  
rounding hotels are likely to be full, a lower overbooking limit is normally  
set.  
Overbooking of a different type occurs in resorts and leisure hotels  
that work with tour operators. The hotels sign an agreement with the  
tour operator to guarantee a minimum number of rooms \(*allotments*\)*,*  
but the tour operator is usually not obliged to fill the rooms. The hotel  
can sign for more allotments than it has rooms, hoping that by pooling  
the allotments across tour operators the final show demand will be less  
than its capacity.  
**10.2.2.4 Capacity Controls**  
Hotel capacity controls follow the traditional nested allocation and  
bid price5 schemes of airlines, with a few important differences. For one,  
control is often based on the length of stay. A *minimum length-of-stay*  
*control* is often used to accept only stays over a certain duration. The  
rationale for this type of control is that during high-demand period, the  
hotel does not want short-stay customers occupying rooms for a small  
number of days and displacing demand of longer-stay customers. A  
*maximum length-of-stay control* is the opposite; it sets an upper bound  
on the duration of stay, so lower-revenue, long-stay guests do not displace  
higher-revenue, short-stay guests. A *closed-to-arrival control* restricts  
bookings that start on a selected date. An *open-for-day use* means only  
bookings with zero nights \(only day use\) will be offered \(in a specified  
rate code\).  
These length-of-stay controls are somewhat redundant if a hotel RM  
system uses a bid price system; nevertheless, many PMS systems still of-  
fer them to support incumbent hotel pricing structures and management  
practices. \(See Table 10.2.\)  
Most hotel RM systems make intraday forecasts and optimize much  
more frequently than do airline systems. It is not unusual to see opti-  
mization being run every hour as the date of usage nears.  
5With bid price implementations dominating. In the hotel industry, bid prices are sometimes  
referred to as *hurdle rates.* *Industry Profiles* 531  
# 10.3 Rental Car  
RM practices in the rental-car industry have similarities to both the  
airline and hotel RM. However, again there are differences worth noting.  
# 10.3.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing  
There are six major rental-car companies in the U.S.\: Hertz, Avis,  
National, Budget, Alamo, and Dollar, with nearly 95% market share  
between them. The business is somewhat similar to that of hotel chains\:  
some own all their properties, some work on a franchise basis, and a few,  
especially at remote locations, just take bookings and subcontract out  
actual car rentals to a local company.  
A significant percentage of their business comes from airport loca-  
tions, so it is no surprise that the customer segments for rental cars  
closely mirror those of airlines. The deregulation of the airline industry  
also affected rental-car companies significantly, increasing the volume of  
business and changing the mix of business and leisure customers.  
The product of a rental-car company is a combination of car type  
\(there can be up to 20 car types\), insurance options, pickup and drop-  
off location, advance purchase restrictions, and length of rental. Many  
corporations and travel agencies negotiate special rates with car-rental  
companies, which are accessed through special discount codes. These  
contracts are usually for a fixed-per-day price across all or most loca-  
tions for a given period. Segmentation also occurs in the channels of dis-  
tribution, with special discounts for booking directly on the company’s  
website.  
There are some subtle differences in customer booking and rental be-  
havior compared with airlines and hotels. A customer who shows up at  
a hotel or for an airline flight at the last minute \(called a *walk-up\)* is  
usually willing to pay a high price for the service because the limitations  
imposed by airline schedules or hotel locations restrict their alternatives.  
Such walk-ups, therefore, pay near full price in those industries.  
On the other hand, most car-rental counters are located at airports,  
clustered together; so walk-up customers have many alternatives to  
choose from with little search costs for shopping around. Therefore,  
the prices quoted to such walk-up customers are heavily influenced by  
the local availability of cars and competition. In periods of low demand,  
prices may actually be lower on the day of the rental than they are when  
booked in advance. On the other hand, during peak-demand periods,  
carefully setting aside inventory for walk-ups can have revenue benefits,  
just as in the airline industry. Such last minute pricing for day-zero 532 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
customers is typically the responsibility of local field managers, and RM  
systems have to account for the resulting uncertainty in day-zero prices.  
**10.3.2 RM Practice**  
One significant feature of car-rental RM is the nature of capacity. Ca-  
pacity is much more flexible than it is in either airline or hotel RM. For  
example, a rental-car company may operate more than one location in a  
city or a geographical area \(for example, a downtown and an airport lo-  
cation\). Inventory at each one of the locations can be pooled \(*intrapool*\)*,*  
allowing greater flexibility in adjusting capacity to meet demand. Even  
if there is only one location in a given area, capacity can usually be  
increased or decreased by *interpool* moves, by moving cars from nearby  
cities, and also by controlling the sale of older vehicles and turn-backs  
to manufacturers. Small adjustments to the fleet size at a location can  
therefore be made on a weekly basis if need be.  
Available capacity is also affected by customers who rent at one  
location and drop off at another \(*migratory inventory,* Carroll and  
Grimes \[100\]\), creating a network imbalance, or by customers who re-  
turn the car earlier or later than their planned return date \(akin to a  
hotel guest who understays or overstays\). This means the capacity itself  
is often uncertain.  
Free upgrading, in which a customer is given a car of higher rental  
value for no extra charge, is also an important factor in rental-car RM.  
Indeed, when demand for a lower car type exceeds the available inven-  
tory and the forecasted demand for a higher category car type is low,  
car-rental companies often plan to give free upgrades. This practice is  
analogous to planned overbooking over multiple compartments by air-  
lines, where economy passengers who cannot be accommodated in the  
coach compartment get free upgrades to business-class \(see Section 4.5\).  
However, the practice is more prevalent in car-rental RM because there  
are many more inventory types and the capacities are more evenly bal-  
anced across the different car types.  
Business customers typically select mid- and full-size vehicles, have  
insurance protection and gas included in the rate, and rent and return  
during the week. Leisure customers drive smaller cars or vans and on  
average rent longer than business customers. As a result, RM product-  
segmentation restrictions include Saturday-night stay, minimum length  
of stay, and weekend rates to stimulate midweek rentals. Many rates  
have blackout periods where they are not available \(such as holiday  
weekends\).  
Carroll and Grimes \[100\] describe an implementation of a RM system  
at Hertz. Although at the core, the system calculates marginal values *Industry Profiles* 533  
and uses a bid-price control to make accept/reject decisions for bookings,  
it differs from airline RM systems in some significant ways. Most no-  
tably, RM is very closely integrated with capacity planning—how many  
cars to purchase, where to deploy them, what products to offer and  
sell. Figure 10.3 shows the relationship between the RM system and the  
capacity management systems.  
**10.4 Retailing**  
RM in retailing is a relatively new but growing practice. Apparel  
and grocery retailers have to deal with highly perishable and seasonable  
products. High-tech retailers \(PCs, consumer electronics\) have simi-  
lar problems, as their inventory loses value rapidly due to technological  
obsolescence. These characteristics mean that tactical demand man-  
agement is important economically for retailers. Recently, a number of  
specialized software firms have entered the market for providing RM sys-  
tems to retailers, and several major retailers have adopted or are testing  
these systems. Retail RM differs from the industries we’ve discussed  
thus far in that dynamic pricing, in the form of discounts, markdowns, 534 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and promotions—rather than capacity controls—are used to manage de-  
mand.  
**10.4.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
Characterizing retailing practices is difficult because retailers sell very  
different products using a variety of different formats and channels.  
Broadly, retailers can be classified as either selling durable or nondurable  
goods. Durable-good sales constitutes between 35 to 45% of total retail  
sales in the U.S. \[485\]. Table 10.3 gives a list of the top 10 retailers  
of the world and their revenues for the year 2002. The revenue of the  
largest retailer, Walmart, exceeds \$200 billion, which gives an idea of the  
importance of even small incremental gains from RM. Table 10.3 also  
shows the different categories of stores for each of the firms. Among the *Industry Profiles* 535  
top 200 retailers of the world, the breakdown by store type is shown in  
Figure 10.4.  
Some retailers—such as a grocery stores, department stores, and e-  
commerce sites like Amazon.com—sell an assortment of products from  
different manufacturers and suppliers. Others sell only own-brand or  
private-label merchandize—such as direct-to-consumer firms like Gate-  
way and Dell and private-label retailers like The Gap or Eddie Bauer.  
There are specialty stores that carry a deep selection of one type of prod-  
uct, and mass merchants and department stores that sell a tremendous  
range of products. Retailers may sell through physical stores, catalogues,  
and online—or some combination of all three. Competition is generally  
considered intense in the retailing industry because consumers typically  
have many alternatives and can buy through many different retail chan-  
nels. Profit margins in the retail industry rarely exceed 3%, as can be  
seen from Table 10.3.  
However, customer do vary in terms of their geographical location,  
their preference for different channels, the importance they place on  
customer service and the in-store experience, their preference to buy  
early rather than late in the season, and their willingness to spend time  
searching products and prices. As a result, time of purchase, sales chan-  
nel, and location tend to be the major segmentation mechanisms used  
in retail RM.  
Regardless of the format, most retailers have to manage prices for  
thousands of *stock-keeping units \(SKUs\)* and control a large number of  
in-store and out-of-store promotional campaigns. Moreover, prices can  
vary based on the channel of distribution and by geographical region or  
country. There are also several ways of implementing price changes— 536 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
including coupons, promotions, markdowns, and tie-ins. Thus, the num-  
ber of prices that need to be managed can be very large indeed.  
The challenges of RM vary depending on the type of retail environ-  
ment. As a sample of these differences, we next look at RM practices in  
apparel, grocery, and Internet retailing.  
**10.4.1.1 Apparel Retailing**  
Apparel has short life cycles and is usually progressively marked down,  
and at the end of the sales season taken off shelves and sold at clearance  
prices or through discount outlets. Figure 10.5 shows the magnitude of  
markdowns over the last 20 years. Indeed in retail management, a firm’s  
markdown dollar budget, defined as the original list price minus the final  
sale price, is a closely tracked number.  
The duration of the apparel sales season may be anywhere from a few  
months to a year. Most apparel is manufactured overseas \(for U.S. and  
Europe\) and has to be ordered well ahead of the sales season. The pro-  
duction and ordering cycle is often too long to reorder during a season,  
so retailers must precommit to the quantity stocked of each item.6  
Forecasting is an important and difficult task in apparel retailing.  
Items have to be ordered by size, color, and style. For a retailing chain,  
inventory also has to be allocated by store and the retailer may occa-  
sionally need to redistribute inventory. As apparel items are often new  
and unique every season, there may be little historical data available  
for forecasting. Hence, the judgment of store buyers plays an impor-  
tant role and some RM systems use Bayesian forecasting techniques to  
merge a buyer’s prior beliefs with observed in-season sales data \(see  
Section 9.3.6\).  
The initial price of items in apparel retailing is generally determined  
manually \(at least for “designer merchandize” \[506\]\) because of the judg-  
ment required to evaluate brands, quality, and design attractiveness. In  
addition, price targets are often part of the initial product planning for  
an item. Once prices are set, RM systems are used to manage the timing  
and depth of markdowns based on sales trends \(at the store or regional  
levels\), inventory levels, forecasts and managerial targets, and business  
rules. Promotional events also influence the markdown strategy. RM  
systems also typically provide “what-if” analysis that allows managers  
to estimate the impact of markdowns. In addition to markdown deci-  
sion support, the RM system may provide forecasts, initial buy recom-  
6The exception is the use of “quick response” supply strategies, which attempt to provide  
within-season replenishment of apparel, using both fast logistics and domestic manufacturers. *Industry Profiles* 537  
mendations, store-level allocations, size allocations, and replenishment  
recommendations.  
**10.4.1.2 Grocery**  
Grocery retailing differs from apparel in several respects. First, most  
goods are consumables that are purchased repeatedly by consumers over  
time. In addition, goods are replenished frequently. As a result, inven-  
tory constraints and seasonalities are less of an issue in grocery retail  
RM. However, there are significant substitution effects in grocery re- 538 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
tailing. Consumers have choices of many brands, and brand-switching  
behavior is common. Consumers also stockpile, buying many units of  
a product when the price is low, which reduces their future purchases.  
Therefore, grocers have to consider the value of consumers’ purchases  
over time and plan to attract both current and repeat purchases. Con-  
sumers also tend to be more price-sensitive with repeat-purchase prod-  
ucts, and in general, there is less differentiation of products and am-  
bience among grocers. All this leads to more direct and intense price  
competition. Margins in the grocery business are also very low.  
Other factors link the RM decisions for related products in grocery  
retailing. Stores are often more concerned with the profits they generate  
on a *category* of products than on the profits they generate on any given  
brand or given product within a category. This has led many stores to  
adopt a *category management* approach to pricing and inventory deci-  
sions.  
Additionally, consumers often shop a grocery store for a bundle of  
goods. As a result, stores may stock and price certain products more  
for their effect on consumers’ store-choice decisions rather than for the  
profits they generate directly. Also, consumer perceptions on whether  
the retailer has high or low prices are formed largely through repeat-  
purchase items \(such as milk or bread\). Low prices \(even at or below  
cost\) on these items can drive traffic to a store and benefit overall sales  
and customer satisfaction. However, a low-price “loss-leader” strategy  
is normally applied only to a small subset of products. These so-called  
*market-basket effects* play an important role in RM in the grocery sector.  
Grocery stores also carry a tremendous variety of products. An av-  
erage grocery store may stock nearly 40,000 SKUs. The product mix  
consists of both perishables \(meat, vegetables and diary products\), non-  
perishables \(consumer packaged-goods or dry goods; toilet paper, canned  
tomatoes, pet food\), and frozen and chilled goods, each requiring a dif-  
ferent pricing strategy. *Industry Profiles* 539  
Because of the large assortment of products, *menu costs*—the costs  
of changing prices—is an important consideration for grocery retailers.  
Electronic devices that are connected to a database and can change  
prices automatically \(electronic shelf labels or ESLs\) reduce these costs  
but are not yet widely deployed. In the vast majority of cases, grocers  
implement price changes by having clerks manually retag products with  
new price labels. This process is both expensive and time-consuming.  
Consequently, prices for many items are relatively stable and change only  
for competitive reasons or for manufacturer promotions or discounts.  
The initial price for fruits and vegetables tends to follow a market  
price determined by overall supply and demand in wholesale markets.  
Retail prices are then marked down as the expiration date nears. For  
nonperishables, the price is influenced strongly by the manufacturer’s  
wholesale pricing. Volume discounts \(truckload pricing\) is common and  
may influence a retailers ordering and pricing strategy. Trade promo-  
tions at the wholesale level are also a common practice and retailers may  
or may not pass these trade promotions on in the form of lower retail  
prices.  
Promotions are very common in the grocery industry, and retail RM  
systems help grocery stores plan and execute promotions optimally. RM  
models recommend which product in which category to promote, the  
size of the products to promote, the best advertising strategy \(amongst  
display, local ad or regional ad\) and the optimal discounting to meet  
the store’s objectives. RM software may also recommend baseline prices  
for products, depending on the store positioning \(for example, quality  
products, convenience store, warehouse food market\), store location, and  
local demographics.  
**10.4.1.3 Internet Retailing**  
The RM issues faced by Internet retailers are somewhat distinct from  
those of bricks-and-mortar retailers. For one, an unprecedented level of  
customization and customer profiling can be performed while the cus-  
tomer is shopping online. The Internet also makes prices more transpar-  
ent to consumer, which makes price comparison easier; “shopbots” and  
price-comparison sites gather information from multiple vendors, allow-  
ing consumers to compare prices easily and in real time. At the same  
time, prices can be changed by online retailers at near-zero cost.  
These features have led to two early predictions on how the Internet  
would affect retail pricing practices\: first, that Internet prices would be  
significantly lower than in traditional brick-and-mortar store prices, and  
prices would vary little from one retailer to another; and second, that re-  
tailers would move to real-time dynamic pricing, customizing price based 540 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
on supply and demand and their knowledge of the individual customer.  
However, neither of these predictions has proved to be true. Internet  
prices show significant variations among retailers—as much, if not more,  
than the price variations observed among bricks-and-mortar retailers—  
with the largest retailers not necessarily selling at the lowest price. A  
survey by McKinsey \[126\] showed that Internet shoppers rate price as  
relatively low in importance in their purchase decisions; brand, prod-  
uct information, and customer service rate consistently ahead of price.  
The same McKinsey survey \[126\] finds only 8% of Internet shoppers are  
bargain hunters, who would buy only at the cheapest e-retailer.  
To quote Eli Katz, president of e-Commerce for Fragrance Counter  
and Cosmetics Counter \[505\], a retailer that does not discount heavily\:  
There’s always going to be customers who look for price, and there’s always  
going to be customers who look for service, just like some people shop at Saks  
and some shop at Walmart. That will hold true on the Web as well.  
The second prediction, that firms would practice dynamic pricing,  
has also only partially borne out. To quote Ken Harris, CIO of Gap  
Inc. \[250\]\:  
I wouldn’t rule it \[dynamic pricing\] out. Right now, I don’t think it’s quite  
ready. It’s important that consumers understand how pricing is determined  
and that they feel it’s fair.  
Stephen Hamlin, VP of operations for iQVC, the Internet arm of the  
QVC Shopping Network \[250\] echoes this sentiment\:  
One thing we really believe in is unilateral prices. If it’s on TV for one price,  
it’s on the website for that same price; if it changes on TV, it changes on the  
Web.  
Moreover, there has also been some high-profile consumer backlash  
against dynamic pricing online. The most famous such incident occurred  
in 2000 when Amazon.com was discovered to be offering different prices  
for the same DVDs to different customers based on their profiles.7 An  
incident with one consumer was widely reported in the news media, and  
Amazon quickly stopped the practice in the wake of this publicity. \(See  
Section 11.5 for further discussion in a RM implementation context.\)  
While explicit price manipulation has not been well received by con-  
sumers, other marketing tactics are practiced very efficiently on the Web.  
Tools such as *collaborative filtering* \(a data-mining technology that infers  
customer tastes based on “similar” customer purchases\) create product  
7 “On the Web, Price Tags Blue,” *Washington Post,* September 27, 2000. *Industry Profiles* 541  
recommendations and presentations in real-time based on customer in-  
formation and current shopping behavior. Volume discounts are offered  
to encourage customers to buy larger quantities or bundles are created  
to increase their buy size. Online promotions and coupons are tailored  
to separate the price-sensitive customer and induce a customer to make  
a purchase. Such tactics are largely rules-based in current e-CRM appli-  
cations, though it is likely that models and algorithms will play a more  
significant role in optimizing these decisions in the future.  
Another new use of the Internet for e-tailers is online price testing.  
Selling at a single price provides very little information about the price  
sensitivity of customers. Because of the low menu costs for e-tailing,  
experiments are conducted online to gauge price sensitivity. A few price-  
optimization vendors provide this capability in their products.  
**10.4.2 RM Practice**  
There has been significant commercial activity in retail RM in recent  
years, with several new technology vendors offering software systems  
targeted at different segments of the retail industry. These retail RM  
applications focus on improving gross margins by optimizing base prices,  
markdowns, and promotions.  
As mentioned, a key difference between retail RM and traditional air-  
line and hotel RM is that it is price-based rather than quantity-based—  
that is, market-response models are utilized for dynamic pricing. This  
requires an ability to estimate the demand effects of short-term price  
changes.  
Another important difference is that historical data is often inade-  
quate for making good demand forecasts, especially for seasonal, fashion  
and high-tech products. Thus, there is more emphasis on forecasting  
demand for an item based on its in-season sales and the sale of “compa-  
rable” items. Experimenting with price changes at a sample of locations  
is also a common technique for gauging price sensitivity.  
**10.4.2.1 Features of a Retail RM System**  
Besides the price-optimization functions, retail RM applications pro-  
vide important operational and productivity benefits, such as  
Automating routine price changes by location and channel,  
Monitoring profit or sales targets for items and categories,  
Tracking the performance of promotions and advertising campaigns,  
Maintaining consistent pricing and rounding rules, 542 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Automating price matching based on competitor prices,  
Supporting price-sensitivity experiments, and  
Generating periodic reports and statistics to track pricing perfor-  
mance.  
Retail RM systems may also include other nonprice decision support  
tools for initial store allocation and assortment decisions, and reordering  
and replenishment of products. Indeed, the current trend is for retail RM  
to be combined within a SCM system under the label *retail analytics.*  
**10.4.2.2 Data Sources**  
The data available for retail RM is very rich indeed. Point-of-sale  
\(POS\) scanner data provides detailed and complete transaction data in  
an electronic format and is available almost instantaneously to retail-  
ers \(and manufacturers\). E-commerce channels add click-stream data,  
making it possible to monitor shopper browsing behavior and estimate  
customer responses.  
In addition, *panel data* tracking total household purchases for a sample  
of consumers, available from market-research firms like IRI and Nielsen,  
allows companies to track and estimate brand-switching and market-  
share information over time. Other firms, such as AWIS Weather Ser-  
vices and Meteorlogix, supply forecasts of weather by micro-region that  
can be incorporated into sales-forecasting models for traffic and weather  
related items. Demographic data \(age, income level, housing costs\) by  
micro-region is also sold by many firms.  
Finally, most large retailers have inventory-control systems, ERP sys-  
tems, and SCM systems that link to supplier inventory systems, ac-  
counting systems \(for cost and labor rates\), financials, and inventory-  
management systems.  
Retail RM systems use some or all of these data sources to perform  
demand forecasting and pricing optimization. They download current  
data from a store’s POS and ERP/SCM systems and combine this with  
the store’s historical data to calibrate forecasting models of demand. The  
models often require some input from buyers and analysts—for example,  
to identify a past product that is “similar to” a new product the store  
is introducing.  
**10.5 Media and Broadcasting**  
As with retailing, RM in the media and broadcasting industry is a  
relatively new practice. Indeed, to date, only a few networks and tele-  
vision stations are reported to practice RM. These include the Seven *Industry Profiles* 543  
Network in Australia, NBC in the U.S. \[83\], and CBC of Canada \[184\].  
Still, the advertising market is large and has many of the characteristics  
conducive to the practice of RM. The sale of advertising time in broad-  
casting, though superficially similar to the sale of airline seats or hotel  
rooms in the sense that it too is a sale of a perishable commodity, has  
features and practices that make it quite distinct.  
**10.5.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
Advertising time is normally bought by ad agencies on behalf of  
clients. The station either sells the space directly or through national  
sales representatives working on behalf of the television station or net-  
work. Advertising agencies also sometimes buy blocks of time in antic-  
ipation of demand from clients. Advertisers can be local, regional, or  
national and are additionally classified by industry \(beverage product  
category, automotive or local dealers, and so on\).  
Advertisers also vary in their time sensitivity. Some are advertising for  
specific promotional events, so timing and placement of ads are critical,  
and they may require this space on very short notice. For others, their  
ads are for general brand awareness or for public information campaigns,  
so the exact timing of ads is less important and moreover can be planned  
well ahead of time.  
**10.5.1.1 Advertising Product**  
The advertising product is classified based on demographics \(such as,  
adults 18+ or females 13–18\) and also the time of the spot \(prime-time,  
late-night\). Table 10.6 shows how inventory is specified in television,  
radio, and print media.  
Demographic differences in a show’s viewership mean that the value  
of a particular slot for a particular advertiser can vary, so segmentation  
of buyers based on demographics is common. The demographics-based  
requirements of advertisers also give broadcasters the flexibility to sub-  
stitute times and programs. For example, if it turns out that a particular  
time slot is oversold, a customer will usually accept a different time slot  
with similar demographics, though many advertisers have strong prefer-  
ences for specific programs.  
**10.5.1.2 Sales Process**  
Advertising space is typically sold in both an upfront \(long-term\) and  
scatter \(short-term\) markets—and also on an opportunistic basis \(called  
*remnant* space for print media\). The television market is further divided  
into national, cable, and local \(spot\) markets. 544 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Up to 90% of national sales are upfront. Upfront sales are made  
at least a year in advance of airing, usually during the June and July  
period. Scatter sales are made each quarter, roughly three to six weeks  
in advance of airing. Opportunistic sales \(similar to airline last minute  
sales\) are the sale of distressed inventory just before airing. The prices  
for upfront sales tend to be 20% to 40% less than for scatter sales; prices  
for opportunistic sales can be as low as 50% below those of scatter sales.  
Customers can purchase inventory as well as options on additional  
inventory, with a deadline for exercising the option. The combination is  
called a *purchase plan.* Table 10.7 shows a sample purchase plan.  
**10.5.1.3 Prices and Ratings**  
The sale price of an advertising slot is based on its *gross rating points*  
\(GRP\)—the percentage of a demographic group in a market viewing  
a program at a point in time. The GRP is measured after the show  
goes on air, based on a sample of viewers that keep a meter or a diary  
record. Therefore, at the time a slot is sold, the exact GRP of the slot  
is uncertain, and only estimates can be provided. Yet buyers pay for  
the actual GRP, typically on a *cost per thousand impressions* \(CPM\)  
basis. Consequently, if the GRP turns out to be less than the promised *Industry Profiles* 545  
GRP, the station may have to compensate the advertiser—usually by  
means of free additional time \(called *make-goods* in the industry\). On  
the other hand, if the GRP turns out to be more than that specified  
in the contract, the buyers usually do not have to pay more, and hence  
the station or network has lost a revenue opportunity. Ratings for new  
television shows in particular are highly uncertain.  
CPM is usually guaranteed for upfront sales, and the advertisers spec-  
ify the target CPM, demographics, frequency, and any other restrictions  
that they may have. In the scatter market, ratings are not normally  
guaranteed, and prices can vary depending on the viewership.  
**10.5.1.4 Preemption**  
Preemption of scheduled advertisements is an accepted practice in the  
broadcast industry. That is, even if the station sells a particular time  
slot to an advertiser, if a higher offer is subsequently received from an-  
other advertiser the station may preempt the original advertiser, offering  
either to substitute another slot or return their money. This preemption  
is common in large media markets but less prevalent in smaller markets,  
where maintaining customer relations takes precedence. Hybrid prac-  
tices, in which only a certain number of slots are sold as preemptable  
slots, also exist in the industry.  
**10.5.1.5 Print Media**  
The sale of advertising in the print media is similar to broadcasting.  
The prices are based on readership and demographics, on the size of  
the advertisement, and on the number of issues that the advertisement  
will be run. Magazines tend to be much more willing than broadcast-  
ers to negotiate prices because their capacity is more flexible. Despite  
the similarities between print and broadcast media, we know of no re-  
ported implementations of RM in the print media, though it remains a  
promising area for applying RM principles.  
**10.5.2 RM Practice**  
Broadcasters use a wide variety of pricing structures in an attempt  
to enhance revenues. For example, the price for a slot may be based  
on the loyalty of the advertisers \(the frequency rate card\), whether the  
advertiser is a local or a national advertiser \(the national and regional  
rate cards\), the ratings \(the grid rate card\), and finally on how rapidly  
the inventory is being sold. These structures evolved partly to segment  
customers based on location and access to information, partly to differen-  
tiate the product based on demographics, and are also partly rough-cut 546 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
attempts at RM \(for example, the prices may be raised based on re-  
maining inventory levels\). Taking a cue from airlines, some stations are  
attempting to further segment their customers based on time of purchase  
and penalties for cancellations.  
The actual prices for each category of inventory are determined by  
competition and historical rates. In addition, many stations raise prices  
after a certain percentage of inventory is sold or offer last-minute dis-  
counts if time is unsold. Again, as mentioned above, it is not unusual to  
see \(at least in major U.S markets\) a system of preemption. However,  
advertisers typically get a lower price if they agree to allow their ads to  
be preempted. Controlling the use of preemptable and nonpreemptable  
slots is an important challenge for RM in the industry.  
Another important factor in the sale of airtime is that it is rarely  
sold in units of a single time slot. Rather, a package deal is normally  
negotiated between the agency and station representatives. For example,  
the advertising agency may have a target GRP and demographic in  
mind for its client for a campaign over a certain period of time, and  
the agency’s goal is to buy a package from a range of television stations,  
programs and time slots to meet that target. This makes it important for  
the broadcaster to know the value of each of its time slots to negotiate  
effectively. Therefore, estimates of the marginal opportunity costs of  
time slots \(their bid prices\) are useful information to a broadcaster.  
This package-deal nature of sales introduces network effects into the  
evaluation and negotiation process. Just as an itinerary for an airline  
is a collection of resources, a package for a television or radio station is  
the sale of capacity for a collection of its shows. A station may therefore  
decide to accept an entire package even if it is losing money on certain  
time slots in the package, provided the overall net revenue contribution  
of the deal is positive.  
Finally, a significant obstacle to RM in broadcasting is that sales  
practices in the industry vary widely, often depending on the traditions  
of each local market. This makes it difficult to construct a common RM  
model and system that is appropriate for a large number of media firms.  
**10.6 Natural-Gas Storage and Transmission**  
The natural-gas industry in the United States has undergone a process  
of deregulation since the mid-1980s. These structural reforms have led to  
a number of innovations, including experimentation with RM techniques. *Industry Profiles* 547  
**10.6.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
In 1985, *Federal Energy Regulatory Commission* \(FERC\) of the United  
States issued Order 436, which required pipelines to provide open access  
to their facilities, allowing consumers to contract separately for pur-  
chases of gas and for transportation services. This encouraged better  
balancing of supplies of gas among producers and consumers. The *Nat-*  
*ural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989* required the removal of all  
price controls on wellhead sales by 1993, allowing natural-gas prices to  
be freely set in the market. Similar deregulation is in progress in a  
number of other parts of the world as well.  
Because of these reforms, the gas industry has gradually moved away  
from long-term minimum-purchase contracts between the pipelines and  
producers toward short-term contracts and spot-markets for buying and  
selling gas. This has tremendously increased the volatility of both prices  
and demand for pipeline services.  
The gas-industry distribution structure consists of local distribution  
companies \(LDCs\), pipeline companies, retail marketing companies, and  
wholesale marketing companies. The customer base of these firms is  
diverse, ranging from large industrial users to individual homeowners. 548 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
LDCs form the end stage of the gas supply chain, delivering gas to  
customers. They typically have to purchase in spot markets \(at least  
for excess requirements\), where prices are volatile, and sell at relatively  
fixed prices to their consumers. Futures contracts, swaps, and options  
are extensively used to manage the resulting risk. Retail marketing  
companies, which do not own physical distribution facilities, handle only  
the marketing and billing functions and contract with LDCs for delivery.  
Wholesalers are one level up in the natural-gas supply chain. They  
buy from gas producers and deliver to LDCs and large industrial ac-  
counts. Their orders are based on forecasts of the demand from large  
customers as well as aggregate demand from LDCs and retail marketers. *Industry Profiles* 549 550 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Wholesalers purchase delivery services from pipeline companies, who  
route gas from the source \(wellhead\) to the end market. As part of  
deregulation in the U.S., pipeline companies were required to unbundle  
purchase and delivery of natural gas \(FERC Order 636, April 1992\).  
Thus, pipeline companies generally are restricted only to transmitting  
or storing gas.  
Besides these traditional firms in the industry, new intermediaries  
have entered as a result of deregulation. Some of these firms are simply  
asset management companies who hedge risks and make profits through  
trading energy-related contracts. Some are market makers who create  
packages and contracts from different pipeline vendors and suppliers and  
become “virtual suppliers” themselves. Internet market places, such as  
Intercontinental Exchange \(ICE\) and \(the now defunct\) EnronOnline  
\(EOL\), were started to facilitate trading of these new instruments.  
**10.6.2 RM Practice**  
For pipeline companies, in particular, the unbundling of transporta-  
tion and purchases of gas has increased their dependence on transporta-  
tion revenue, which is now estimated to constitute nearly 93% of their  
total revenue. These changes and the increased uncertainty in demand  
has made revenue managing pipeline capacity sales all the more critical.  
Pipelines are essentially involved in the sale of space—the capacity  
for transmission or storage. Indeed, pipeline RM is somewhat similar to  
airline RM in that demand is for transport over a network with many  
interconnection points and routings. Pipelines have to price their space  
based on future demand forecasts as well as available capacity. Demand  
is realized in the form of forward contracts \(essentially reservations\)  
with various forms of options \(analogous to airline cancellations and  
no-shows\).  
To give an example of a RM problem in the industry, consider the  
pipeline in Figure 10.6 connecting cities A, B, C, and D. For a certain  
date the residual capacities of the network are as shown in the figure.  
Consider the following bids for future capacity \(Dth=Dekatherms\)\:  
**A-B** 2,000 Dth at 0.15\$/Dth  
**A-C** 5,000 Dth at 0.20\$/Dth  
**B-C** 3,000 Dth at 0.12\$/Dth  
Selling A-C would fetch the highest revenue, but it would exhaust  
capacity on B-C and prevent future sales. If the bids are indivisible,  
the firm may be better off rejecting the A-C bid. If bids are divisible, a *Industry Profiles* 551  
maximum-revenue network-optimization problem gives the optimal al-  
location. For a future date, a RM system would make a forecast of all  
future bids \(volume and price, by origin and destination\) for capacity  
on this network and use one of the network methods of Chapter 3 to  
determine which bids should be accepted now for this future date.  
In addition to the capacity optimization illustrated above, current  
RM systems for gas storage and transmission include the following fea-  
tures \[524\]\:  
Storage and park-and-loan service optimization, in which the pipeline  
company stores a producer’s gas at its storage locations. A *park-and-*  
*loan service* is where the provider puts in gas for later use \(parking\) or  
takes out gas to meet a temporary imbalance, to be returned within  
a specified period \(loaning\). Using park-and-loan, shippers can gen-  
erally avoid buying at high spot prices.  
Firm transportation revenue optimization, in which delivery is pro-  
vided at the guaranteed delivery tariffs.  
Dynamic pricing of interruptible transportation tariffs \(Table 10.9\).  
Capacity contract optimization.  
**10.7 Electricity Generation and Transmission**  
The electricity industry has seen significant deregulation in the mid-  
1990s in the United States and many European Union countries. While  
in principle RM fits in nicely with these newly deregulated markets for  
electricity—and there has been considerable speculation on how RM 552 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
could be applied in the industry \[4\]—to date we know of no electricity  
RM implementations per se, in the sense of market segmentation and  
capacity controls.  
Still, the electricity industry has many characteristics that make it  
well suited to RM methods. Demand for energy is highly variable, vary-  
ing by time of day, day of week, temperature, and season, yet generation  
and transmission capacity is relatively inflexible. Firms use a mix of  
generation technologies \(hydro, nuclear, coal, and gas\) in an attempt  
to respond to demand variations, but generating capacity has limits,  
and near-peak-capacity wholesale prices can rise to nearly 300 times the  
average price \[426\]—even in regions with 20% reserve capacity \[125\].  
Finally, the industry has long used risk and demand management and  
sophisticated trading technologies, so it has the scientific and software  
culture to adapt RM.  
**10.7.1 Industry Structure**  
Much of the deregulation in the electricity industry has focused on  
separating the generation and transmission \(distribution\) functions, cre-  
ating competitive wholesale markets for generators to sell to distributors  
and competitive retail markets for distributors to sell to end consumers.  
Figure 10.7 shows the four main models of electricity competition \(Hunt  
and Shuttleworth \[261\]\). In the complete monopoly model \(10.7\(i\)\), a  
single monopoly controls generation, transmission, and retail sales. In  
the purchasing-agency model, \(10.7\(ii\)\), there is competition in gen-  
eration between the IPPs \(independent power producers\), but a single  
monopolist controls buying and distributing the electricity. In the whole-  
sale competition model \(10.7\(iii\)\), there is competition in generation and  
among distribution companies \(Distcos\). In the model of retail compe-  
tition, there is competition in the generation, wholesale, and retail mar-  
kets for the final consumers \(10.7\(iv\)\). Models \(i\) and \(ii\) are generally  
followed by the traditional—usually state-owned or regulated—utility  
companies, while models \(iii\) and \(iv\) are a result of deregulation. *Industry Profiles* 553 554 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**10.7.2 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
The pricing structures and the management of prices have also changed  
significantly in the wake of deregulation. Wholesale markets have moved  
toward dynamic, market-based pricing, while retail prices have, to a large  
extent, remained fixed \(or have been capped by regulators\). This has  
created often devastating problems for distributors that have to buy in  
wholesale markets and sell in retail markets.8 Risk-management tech-  
niques are widely used by energy-sector companies in an attempt to  
manage such risks, but many of these problems are structural.  
Wholesale markets in electricity are organized at various regional lev-  
els\: state, country, pan-Europe, and global exchanges, such as the Am-  
sterdam Power Exchange. The organization of these wholesale markets  
varies considerably from market to market. For example, trade may be  
through a central compulsory pool market or consist of bilateral trades  
between generators and consumers; prices may be set by bid/ask mecha-  
nisms, market makers, or auctions; the products traded may be electric-  
ity dispatch contracts, options or derivatives; settlement may be based  
on ex ante or ex post pricing; time of bid submission varies \(real-time, 5  
minutes ahead, 30-minute blocks\) as do scheduling and dispatch rules;  
start-up costs and incumbent adjustments \(price adjustments to account  
for the incumbents’ sunk costs during the regulated period\) may be fac-  
tored in as well. Regardless of the exact form and rules of each market,  
the overall goal is to allow supply and demand to determine prices—  
often in real-time—and encourage efficient utilization and allocation of  
energy resources.  
**10.7.3 RM Practice**  
The electricity industry is making some preliminary attempts to im-  
plement dynamic pricing for end consumers—at least for larger industrial  
clients \[545, 181\]. Indeed, industrial customers have long paid differential  
prices depending on the quantity \(nonlinear tariffs\) and time \(peak-load  
pricing\) of their energy usage. However, such schemes require new tech-  
nologies, such as time-of-usage meters, to enable real-time monitoring  
and accurate billing.  
These same meters can, in principle, be used for individual households  
and small businesses. Radio control of the meters give utilities the capa-  
bility to shut off large appliances \(such as air-conditioners and swimming  
8For example, only a few years after the deregulation of California’s energy markets, one  
of the state’s largest distributors, Pacific Gas and Electric, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  
protection with accumulated debts of over \$8.9 billion due to soaring wholesale power costs. *Industry Profiles* 555  
pool pumps\) during periods of peak loads in exchange for lowered rates  
on electricity. Such practices have been reported in trials \(see \[545\]\) and  
exhorted by consultants \(see \[125\] and \[254\]\), but applications of such  
technologies and pricing schemes is not common yet.  
The RM challenges in the electricity industry will undoubtedly be dis-  
tinct from traditional RM industries. RM systems will need to determine  
the value of futures and long-term contracts for generators, evaluate  
complex contract conditions \(such as preemptability\) and handle new  
forecasting requirements \(weather, economic condition, price sensitivity,  
market-price predictions\).  
Fortunately, the data available in the electricity industry is quite de-  
tailed and accurate. Historical hourly demand and price information  
by market is often publicly available. For example, the Electric Power  
Research Institute \(EPRI\) in California sells a database \(StatsBank\)  
of observed load responses to various types of risk-managed prices in  
the United States and United Kingdom. EPRI also has many ongoing  
projects on customer behavior and responses to electricity pricing. Load  
forecasting is also based on weather forecasts, which are commonly avail-  
able. Publicly available macroeconomic factors \(aggregate inventories,  
GDP, income data\) can also be used for long-term energy forecasting.  
Though traditional RM methods are not yet common in electricity  
markets, there is research on applying scientific methods to optimize the  
market pricing decisions of electric generators and distributors. For ex-  
ample, Anderson and Philpott \[14\] describe a body of work on optimizing  
“offer stacks” \(price-quantity bids\) in electricity pool markets. \(See also  
Day et al. \[149\] and Neame et al. \[274\].\) Researchers have also looked at  
how to optimally release power from hydroelectric dams \(see Pritchard  
and Zakeri \[430\]\) in response to dynamic, uncertain market prices. This  
work is very much in the spirit of RM, both in terms of the technical  
methods employed \(such as large-scale stochastic optimization\) and its  
philosophy of using scientific, model-based approaches to quantity and  
price-setting decisions.  
**10.8 Tour Operators**  
Tour operators sell packages of air and ground travel, cruises, and  
board. Some tour operators run their own charter air services, though  
most contract some amount of capacity from third-party suppliers. Tour  
operators share some of the same RM problems encountered by airlines  
and hotels. Yet their RM challenges are unique as they have to manage  
flexible capacity and multiple types of capacity with different costs and  
ownership. 556 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**10.8.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
Tour operators almost exclusively target leisure and vacation cus-  
tomers. Sometimes a package is organized around a group—schools,  
businesses, associations, etc.—but many packages are unaccompanied,  
aimed at individuals and families, with the tour operator selling only  
a package of air travel, rental car, and hotel. Packages are published  
in catalogs or on the Internet and are offered for repeated dates for a  
season or a year. Distribution is through an operator’s own retail offices,  
via the Internet, and through travel agencies.  
To the leisure traveler, buying a package offers convenience \(low search  
costs\) and a low overall price for a trip, at the expense of some loss of  
flexibility. For the suppliers—airlines, car rental companies, and hotels –  
that sell their capacity to tour operators, tour operators offer them a  
chance to reach a very well targeted segment of demand.  
A tour operator’s product is therefore a complex mix of capacities of  
different types, and tour operators offer a large number of such prod-  
ucts. The products are put together by negotiations with the airlines,  
ground transport operators, hotels, and rental-car companies. To price  
a product and plan its sales operations, tour operators either purchase  
blocks of capacity from their suppliers at fixed prices, or they negotiate  
just the rates and let their suppliers control the availability of capacity.  
The planning and process for the tour operator consists of three stages\:  
\(1\) capacity planning, where routes and capacities are fixed tentatively;  
\(2\) a pricing and purchasing stage, where capacity is purchased from  
various sources and prices for the packages are fixed; and \(3\) a RM  
stage, where discounts and promotions are used to stimulate demand  
during the booking period.  
RM for tour operators—as in the rental car industry, which also has  
somewhat flexible capacity—is closely integrated with capacity manage-  
ment, which we describe briefly next.  
**10.8.2 Capacity Management and Base-Price**  
# Setting  
As we mentioned, large tour operators use a mix of their own fleets  
and third-party carriers. The goal of capacity planning is to optimize the  
balance between own-fleet utilization and third-party purchases. Fig-  
ure 10.8 shows an example of a capacity planning exercise of a tour  
operator.  
Setting base prices by and large is guided by expected load factors,  
margins, competition, costs, and the previous year’s prices. Figure 10.9  
gives good insight into the price-setting process at a tour operator. It is *Industry Profiles* 557  
essentially cost-based pricing allowing for margins and risks \(load-factors  
as well as price-dilution risks\). The planning process \(purchases and  
price setting\) is finalized around six weeks prior to the first departure.  
In the final five to six weeks of the booking period, a combination of 558 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
capacity adjustments and RM is used to manage sales, which we describe  
next.  
**10.8.3 RM Practice**  
A tour operator can increase its revenue by \(1\) segmentation of its cus-  
tomer base \(family holiday, weekend packages, exotic tours, back-packers  
tours, organized tours, school trips, cruise packages\) marketing special  
packages to each segment; \(2\) allocating scarce capacity to more prof-  
itable packages by using capacity controls that make low-profit packages  
available only on unconstrained dates; and \(3\) using price-sensitivity  
estimation and dynamic pricing tools to adjust prices to stimulate de-  
mand.  
Industry presentations indicate that to date only a few tour operators  
have implemented some form of RM \[439, 557, 579, 264\]. Current usage  
appears limited to long-term sales forecasting, booking-trends forecast-  
ing, and statistical reporting for package sales. Little optimization and  
control of availability appears to be used at present. The role of RM is  
to monitor demand during the booking period, and if demand exceeds  
the planned load factors, increase, or shift capacity from low-demand  
products, and if demand is below the planned load factors, advertise  
and run promotions to stimulate demand \(Figure 10.10\). *Industry Profiles* 559  
Part of the difficulty in implementing multiclass quantity-based RM  
in the tour industry is that there are no standard reservation systems for  
automating distribution and sales. Some industry standards are being  
developed specifically for the tour industry \[518\] by the EDI standards  
body Travel Technology Initiative \(TTI\) using XML, but these standards  
are not yet in widespread use.  
**10.9 Casinos**  
RM is applicable in casinos in two areas\: renting out the casino’s hotel  
rooms and managing capacity and pricing in the gaming area. We look  
at each in turn.  
**10.9.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
The core business of a casino is gambling; renting rooms and meeting  
space is a secondary line of business in most casinos, whose main purpose  
is to attract gambling revenues. Two popular edicts in the industry are  
that gamers play more when they stay, and gamers play where they stay.  
The average daily gambling revenue from the different gamer types can  
range from \$20 to \$20,000 \[422\], so it is understandable that the revenue  
from rooms is not the highest priority for a casino. Indeed, many casinos  
give rooms away free to their top, “high-roller” customers.  
**10.9.2 RM Practice**  
The RM problem in casinos, therefore, is one of controlling availability  
based on a combination of room revenues and the amount a customer  
is expected to spend on the casino’s gambling floor. To facilitate the  
latter, many casinos have instituted special loyalty-card programs for  
their repeat customers that are a cross between the debit cards of banks  
and the frequent flyer cards of airlines. These cards track how much the  
customer has spent on the floor. Hence, when a customer calls in to  
make a booking and gives his card number, the casino can assess how  
much revenue the customer will potentially bring in and the RM system  
quotes availability and price based on this information.  
RM systems implement this customer value assessment through a  
*gaming value function.* The software recognizes and ranks repeat guests  
by their gambling history. Harrah’s, a large U.S. casino, reports a modi-  
fication in which its RM system was customized to work with their Total  
Rewards Player \(TRP\) program \[92\]. Guests in this program are ranked  
in tiers. High-rollers are identified and receive the lowest room rates,  
while first-time guests and nongamblers get the rack room rate. When  
a customer calls Harrah’s for a reservation, the system automatically 560 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
generates a customized room rate based on the customer segment of the  
caller. Harrah’s has up to 64 segments and each segment has a code  
\(such as AEP for avid experienced player \[361\]\).  
Another potential use of RM in casinos, mentioned in industry talks  
but not implemented yet, is to control capacity on the gaming floor  
itself—to determine the minimum bets at each table, and to adjust the  
number of tables of each game which are opened.  
**10.10 Cruise Ships and Ferry Lines**  
Even though both cruise and ferry lines have superficially similar oper-  
ations \(they transport people by ship\), there are considerable differences  
between the two businesses when it comes to RM practices.  
**10.10.1 Customers, Products, and Prices**  
Cruise lines can vary from small harbor cruise boats to large interna-  
tional operators offering long multiport itineraries. Ferry lines operate  
regular scheduled transportation service to move both people and cargo.  
There are further subdivisions called *fast-ferry* and *cruise/ferry.*  
Cruise ships are essentially floating hotels. There are a wide variety  
of cabin types and a large spread of fares, some of which are sold with  
advance-purchase restrictions. Sales are made either directly by the  
cruise company or through tour operators and travel agencies.  
Unlike airlines and hotels, however, cruise customers are almost ex-  
clusively discretionary travelers. This has historically created some dif-  
ficulties in maintaining price discipline in the industry. For example,  
there is a significant market for people willing to take a cruise on short  
notice at very low prices. Cruise lines facing an underutilized vessel are  
frequently tempted to lower prices and offer last minute bargain rates  
on some sailings. However, customers have, over time, learned of this  
practice and as a result are often unwilling to buy advance-purchase  
products.  
Ferries, in contrast, have commercial, commuter, and leisure seg-  
ments. Ferry traffic has more in common with the airlines or passenger  
railways than it does with hotels. They segment based on volume of  
purchases \(monthly commuter passes\), one-way and return purchase,  
peak and off-peak times, and customer type \(student, child, senior citi-  
zen\). Long-haul ferries also offer advance-purchase fares, and some offer  
private-cabin service. *Industry Profiles* 561  
**10.10.2 RM Practice**  
Cruise lines have some special characteristics that distinguish their  
RM practices from hotels. First, all stays are of the same length; though  
some multiport cruises let customers join and leave at different ports.  
Also, overbooking for the ship as a whole is generally not practiced, as  
it is difficult to “walk” a cruise passenger; overbooking at a cabin-type  
level is more common.  
Cruise operators also have to coordinate with airlines to bring cus-  
tomers to and from their various ports of departure. Cruise operators  
may purchase a block of seats from an airline and must therefore man-  
age the air-travel capacity along with the ship capacity, similar to the  
problem faced by tour operators.  
Finally, even if the cruise is all-inclusive, customers have many shop-  
ping opportunities on board, and the cruise lines consider shopping rev-  
enue in assessing the overall net revenue contribution of the different  
customer segments.  
Ferry operators also face some unique RM challenges. For example,  
ferry lines have to manage passenger space and vehicle space jointly.  
Combination cruise/ferry lines have to manage inventories of cabins, pas-  
senger space, and vehicle space. Thus, they too are faced with multiple-  
resource RM problems.  
Most large cruise lines, such as Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal  
Caribbean, practice some form of RM for controlling sales on their ships.  
Smaller river and harbor cruise companies, like New York Cruise Lines,  
are also known to use GDSs and practice some simple RM. Ferry line  
RM implementation is more sporadic and less known, but there are a  
few firms, such as Transmediterranea, that are reported to have RM  
systems.  
**10.11 Passenger Railways**  
Passenger railroad RM is similar to airline or hotel RM, albeit with  
some differences.  
**10.11.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
A large passenger railway company can have over 2,000 trains daily.  
Because many railways are nationalized, it is common to have only one  
passenger railway operating in a market. Consequently, they do not face  
direct price competition and have greater flexibility in pricing than do  
airlines or even hotels. Nevertheless, railways compete with the other  
modes of transportation such as airlines, automobiles, ferries, or buses, 562 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and hence pricing is influenced by the prices and availability of these  
transportation alternatives.  
In addition to the prices of competing travel alternatives, pricing for  
trains also depends on the speed of the train, the time of operation, and  
the distance of travel. High-speed trains \(such as the TGV in France\)  
offer service that is comparable or better than airlines in terms of travel-  
time between city centers and on-board amenities and consequently are  
priced higher than ordinary trains.  
The passenger mix varies depending on whether the route is a short-  
haul or long-haul and on the time of day. For example, a Washington-  
Philadelphia train at 6\:00 PM will have a large number of business  
passengers, while a Washington-Chicago train carries primarily discre-  
tionary travelers. As a result, one sees multiple fares more often in  
short-haul markets. However, the number of fares offered by railways is  
typically small—two or three—with advance-purchase restrictions of five  
or fourteen days. For instance, Rail Canada sells seats in four classes Y,  
B, Q, and V with progressive advance-purchase discounts.  
Long-haul trips rely more on product differentiation \(type of accom-  
modation\) and identifiable customer types than on booking characteris-  
tics. Further segmentation and discounts are based on youth rail-passes,  
senior-citizen passes, and family packages with discounts for a family  
traveling together. Cancellation fees and other penalties normally apply  
for discount fares. Table 10.11 shows the product types and fare types  
for Amtrak’s long-distance \(overnight\) train service. Prices for the ac-  
commodation part of the tariff range from \$347 to \$1,067 \(standard  
versus deluxe bedroom going from Chicago to Emeryville\). Dynamic  
pricing in the form of weekly promotions, which usually carry some  
sort of advance-purchase and cancellation restrictions, is becoming more  
prevalent. *Industry Profiles* 563  
**10.11.2 RM Practice**  
AmTrak in the U.S, VIA Rail Canada, and Eurostar and Société Na-  
tionale des Chemins de Fer Francais \(SNCF\) in France are a few large  
passenger railways that are known to actively use RM techniques. The  
network structure for a railway is a cross between that of hotels and  
airlines. A single railway line resembles the length-of-stay network of  
a hotel; however, there are many connection points where passengers  
can switch trains, making it a more complicated network. Amtrak is  
reported to use five fare buckets, opening and closing them depending  
on demand to come \(Johnston \[271\]\), with the capacity decisions made  
jointly between the train or corridor manager and the central RM de-  
partment.  
**10.12 Air Cargo**  
RM is a nearly universal mission-critical tool for passenger airlines,  
so cargo would seem a logical area for airlines to apply their RM skills.  
However, the use of RM in airline cargo at present is rather sporadic.  
**10.12.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
Most passenger airlines accept cargo to fill the empty holds of their  
passenger aircraft. The bulk of the space is sold under long-term con-  
tracts to a small number of shippers, normally through a bidding process  
conducted only once or twice a year.  
Still, the larger carriers have partially segmented their market and  
sell both premium \(fast\) and regular \(slow\) shipping. Ad-hoc requests  
and long-term contracts are some other segmentation criteria used. Re-  
strictions or advance-purchase requirements are not prevalent at present.  
Pricing is primarily distance-based and the typical tariff structure does  
not segment the market significantly, though the potential exists to seg-  
ment based on factors such as the quantity shipped and day of week.  
**10.12.2 RM Practice**  
Airline cargo RM is more complex than passenger airline RM. For  
one, the hold space of the carrier is limited both by the weight and  
volume it can carry, so shipments have to be controlled based both on  
their weight and volume. Also, the weight constraint of the aircraft  
depends on both the number of passengers carried and the cargo. Thus,  
the decisions for both passenger and cargo are interrelated and ideally  
should be coordinated by a single RM system.  
The long-term nature of customer relationships also makes capacity  
control difficult. Air cargo carriers rarely—if ever—reject a shipment 564 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
when they have available space. Long-term customer relations take pri-  
ority because unlike passenger sales, which are anonymous and numer-  
ous, air cargo carriers work closely with a few important customers who  
ship large volumes. Still, there are occasional small-volume shippers in  
addition to large shippers, and some segmentation between the large,  
contract shippers and the smaller, “spot-market” shippers is possible.  
To date, only the largest carriers practice some form of cargo RM, and  
even in these cases, the systems are not comparable in sophistication to  
the airline’s passenger RM systems. Many cargo RM systems in opera-  
tion do mostly simple reporting, overbooking, and aggregate forecasting.  
Unlike passenger systems, few make automated accept/reject or block  
allocation decisions.  
The few airlines that have implemented or are currently implement-  
ing cargo RM are also cautious when evaluating the success of their  
systems. Edward R. O’Meara, senior director of cargo RM for Conti-  
nental Airlines, cites the complexity of implementing RM in air cargo as  
one factor \[483\]\:  
It’s been a success story but it’s not been a slam dunk either. It’s a very  
difficult process because you’re changing a lot of roles. I see it as an extra  
tool you don’t use blindly. You always have to keep the customer in mind and  
that’s the thing with RM\: you don’t want to do something stupid that hurts  
your customer.  
According United Airline’s Lung, the low status of air cargo in the in-  
dustry is another factor \[483\]\:  
Cargo is not as glamorous and is viewed more as a byproduct or an after-  
thought. Typically you have lots of investment opportunities within the airline  
and cargo is not viewed as your core business.  
Another obstacle is data. Historical data is often collected only by  
weight or volume \(usually weight\), so many airlines don’t have adequate  
data to implement a RM system. Legacy systems to manage cargo are  
also a significant barrier to implementing RM.  
**10.13 Freight**  
Shipping, trucking, railway, and intermodal companies transport bil-  
lions of dollars worth of cargo every year. The emergence of global  
supply chains and just-in-time \(JIT\) manufacturing have increased the  
strategic importance of logistics, and companies are often willing to pay  
a premium to have reliable, fast deliveries. Freight transport is sub-  
ject to significant capacity and time constraints. Together, these factors  
make freight transport a natural candidate for RM methods. *Industry Profiles* 565  
**10.13.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
Most commercial freight today is moved in containers over one or  
more transport modes \(ship, rail, and truck\). \(If the transportation  
involves more than one form of transport, it is called *intermodal ship-*  
*ping.*\) Intermodal shipping offers a high level of service at a relatively  
low cost. It is often cheaper than moving a shipment entirely by truck,  
while offering comparable flexibility in routing and timing. Standard  
containerization also reduces transfer and handling costs considerably,  
as most rail yards and shipping docks today have specialized facilities  
for handling containerized freight.  
Freight customers can have different service level requirements. For  
instance, package delivery companies and the U.S. Postal Service require  
strict service commitments and schedules tightly integrated with their  
own operations. Often a carrier has dedicated trucks and trains assigned  
to these customers. Other customers, such as *less-than-truckload \(LTL\)*  
*shippers* and freight forwarders, are less sensitive to delivery time and  
willing to accept longer delivery times and less reliable service for lower  
shipping charges. These time-price sensitivity differences provides a nat-  
ural means for segmenting customers in the industry; a sample portfolio  
is shown in Table 10.12. Rates are also segmented based on the type  
of good being shipped, as well as by the weight and volume of each  
shipment. Many shippers purchase freight services through long-term  
contracts. The contracts require the freight company to guarantee ca-  
pacity on demand. However, shippers have little obligation to use the  
services they contract for—or even to pay the prices agreed to in the con-  
tract. Indeed, if spot prices are cheaper, shippers commonly bypass their  
contract carriers and ship using the cheaper spot carriers \[426\]. These  
practices make it difficult for carriers to maintain pricing discipline.  
Long-term contracts also make customer relations extremely impor-  
tant and—as shippers are reluctant to renegotiate long-term contracts—  
make RM type innovations hard to introduce. However, there is signifi- 566 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
cant business from low-volume, smaller shippers, with whom the freight  
companies have some degree of pricing flexibility.  
Tariffs for terminal-to-terminal shipping are usually different for  
wholesale agreement customers and retail customers and whether the  
shipping is domestic or international. Intermodal and rail pricing plans  
also differ considerably. For ocean carriers, the freight rate is normally a  
percentage of the value of the cargo. Ocean carriers can also be members  
of a conference that controls both the capacity members can introduce  
into the market, as well as monitors tariffs—but as the revenues depend  
on the cargo value, there is nothing to prevent the carrier from using  
RM-type controls to manage the cargo mix \[360\].  
**10.13.2 RM Practice**  
A few large freight companies, including Sea-Land \[213\] \(Sea-Land is  
now integrated into CSX Intermodal\), have implemented RM systems.  
However, RM is not yet widely practiced in freight, although the po-  
tential is significant. For example, low-value demand often fills up the  
weight limits of a ship or truck well before the volume limit is reached,  
forcing the carrier to reject low-volume/weight, high-value demand. In-  
deed, Maragos \[360\] reports that in the shipping industry, low-value cus-  
tomer demand tends to appear before the high value demand, creating  
conditions similar to those in the airlines.  
Structurally, the RM problem in freight is similar to airline or ho-  
tel network problems, in that carriers provide a network of routes and  
scheduled service with capacity constraints on each link. In addition,  
orders are taken over a period of time, and there is a mix of customer  
types, ranging from high-value, low-weight items \(PC components\) to  
low-value, heavy-weight or large-volume items \(raw materials\). Internet  
websites \(such as Rezl and nacsfirst\) are facilitating freight reservations.  
Capacity conditions are somewhat different, however. For example,  
in the case of rail freight, there is considerable flexibility in adding or  
removing capacity to a train because the cars or car blocks are easy to  
add and remove. The capacity of the locomotive at some point prevents  
such additions, but the range is significant. Thus, at present it is rare for  
a railroad to reject a shipment because of capacity constraints. Trucking  
firms are also able to adjust capacity on routes by reallocating tractors  
and drivers. Ships, in contrast, have more of a hard capacity constraint,  
analogous to an airline flight. *Industry Profiles* 567  
**10.14 Theaters and Sporting Events**  
Theaters and sporting events have many characteristics that seem  
well suited to RM methods. Indeed, the existence of “scalpers”—and  
the often exorbitant prices they charge for tickets for popular shows  
and events—is evidence of the demand management potential in this  
industry. Also, many firms are experimenting with auctions and dynamic  
pricing, driven mainly by the Internet.  
**10.14.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
Tickets for events are purchased in advance or on location at the time  
of the event. There are many different customer segments—corporations,  
annual subscription customers, families, tourists—each with varying us-  
age patterns and willingness to pay. There are few regulations on the  
prices that event sponsors can charge or on the sale conditions, with the  
exception of some local municipal laws against scalping.  
Ticket prices for theaters and sporting events depend on factors such  
as the location relative to the stage, the expected demand for the  
event, group affiliation of customers, seasonalities, bulk-sales terms and  
advance-purchase restrictions—besides the draw of the performance it-  
self. Table 10.13 gives an example of the different rate categories for a  
Broadway show \[340\].  
Demand can be highly variable for events, and while historical data is  
sometimes available to make forecasts, there is often considerable uncer-  
tainty about the popularity of a new show or a particular sports event.  
For example, the success of a local sports team or the presence of a star  
player has a significant impact on attendance. For instance, A.T. Kear-  
ney \[23\] reports an Atlanta Hawks game with an overflow of 20,772 one  
day, and an attendance of 8,772 two days later—Michael Jordan played  
the first day; both days had the same prices with no capacity controls,  
a clear inefficiency in pricing.  
The number of seats in the venue, of course, strictly limits capacity.  
However, there are different categories of seats based on location in the  
venue. In terms of the sales process, prices are sometimes published a  
year ahead \(as in the case of opera or concert halls\).  
**10.14.2 Ticket Scalping and Distribution**  
Unlike airline or hotel products, event tickets are almost always trans-  
ferable \(even many subscription tickets for opera/sports events can be  
passed on to others\). A scalper ticket market shows both a missed op-  
portunity to increase revenues for event sponsors as well as a potential 568 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
impediment to the practice of RM. We examine both aspects in this  
section, beginning with a brief look at the legality of ticket scalping.  
**10.14.2.1 Scalping Laws**  
Somewhat surprisingly, most legislation against scalping is at the state  
or municipal level, so there are many variations in the law. In the United  
States around half of the states have either no laws or give jurisdiction  
to municipalities; the other half have strict antiscalping laws. Most of  
the states that limit ticket resales \(either a blanket law, or by type of  
event\) specify that tickets cannot be resold above face value or face value  
plus a small amount.9  
9 *Source\:* eBay Event Tickets Resale Policy. *Industry Profiles* 569  
The public reaction to scalping is generally not against individuals  
selling their tickets \(on eBay or in newspaper ads\) but against profes-  
sional scalpers buying up large blocks of seats in anticipation of a popular  
event and also the nuisance caused by the presence of scalpers in front  
of event venues. To prevent scalping, many events in fact restrict the  
number of tickets they sell to each individual, though this is not always  
enforceable. 570 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
From an economics point of view, there is no reason to prevent a  
spot market just before the event time. There is also no reason to  
believe that scalpers will always charge a premium, as they do take a  
risk in buying up tickets ex ante. Indeed, Happel and Jennings \[236\]  
report the case of the Phoenix City Council, which allowed scalping by  
law but restricted scalpers to selling in a centralized lot in front of the  
Phoenix Suns stadium. The prices obtained for tickets went down as  
the event time approached, similar to markdown dynamic pricing. An  
econometric study by Williams \[567\] found that NFL teams in states  
with anti-scalping laws charged lower prices. His explanation is that  
secondary markets provide valuable information to event organizers if  
the event is underpriced \(if it is overpriced, they know it themselves\),  
allowing them to raise prices. So antiscalping laws may in fact hurt more  
than help event sponsors.  
**10.14.2.2 Primary Sales and Ticket Distribution**  
In contrast to ticket resales, there are few restrictions on the primary  
sale of tickets. \(Primary sales are sales by the artist, team, promoter,  
or organizer of the event.\) So in theory, there is little to prevent event  
organizers themselves from conducting auctions or using dynamic pricing  
if the public finds this acceptable.  
At present most primary ticket sales in the United States are sold  
either by subscription, through an event website or box office, or through  
one of the electronic ticketing agents like TicketMaster \(which bought  
up an earlier rival Ticketron\). There are many Internet-only sellers such  
as Tickets.com and Ticketmall.com.  
In addition, there are the ticket brokers. The U.S. National Associ-  
ation of Ticket Brokers, which boasts over 150 member firms, defines  
their role as to \(1\) provide tickets to events that are sold out through  
the primary market, \(2\) provide premium upfront seats which are the  
most desirable, and \(3\) to provide ticket holders a place to sell their  
unwanted or extra tickets.  
There are a few auction marketplaces for event tickets currently, but  
as distribution moves increasingly to the Internet they are likely to gain  
in popularity. For instance, on a recent day eBay listed over 30, 000  
items in their Tickets category \(including both primary and secondary  
sales\). While this number is minuscule compared to what Ticketmaster  
sells on a given day \(they recently *sold* more than a million tickets on a  
single day\), it is growing. A recent *New York Times* article \[157\] reports  
that Ticketmaster is experimenting with online auctions and used them  
recently for a boxing match. Another online ticketing firm, StubHub, *Industry Profiles* 571  
works with artists and entertainers to auction off front-row seats for  
charity.  
**10.14.2.3 Secondary Markets**  
Why don’t event organizers create their own resale markets and ex-  
tract the money that is now going to the scalpers? Some have. *USA*  
*Today* reports \[251\] that eight Major League Baseball teams have started  
online programs to facilitate the resale of seats, though the websites are  
only to facilitate sales, and they do not yet conduct auctions. In these  
systems, the holder of the ticket posts it for sale at a virtual exchange  
window. When he finds a buyer, the original ticket’s bar code is invali-  
dated and a ticket with a new bar code is created. This removes one of  
the main consumer risks in the scalper market—fraud.  
The biggest impediment to dynamic pricing seems to be the fear  
of negative consumer reactions—the fear that along with the scalper’s  
money, event organizers may also acquire the scalper’s reputation. There  
is a concern that this could cause long-run damage that more than off-  
sets any short-run boost in revenues. Indeed, in many cases, the ticket  
revenue for a single event is a small fraction of the total lifetime value  
of a customer. A performing artist, for instance, normally makes more  
money from album sales than from ticket sales, and a loss of fan goodwill  
could jeopardize future album sales. Sold out concerts also generate good  
publicity. Similarly, opera houses form long-term relationships with their  
clients and do not want to risk losing that patronage. For many sports  
teams, secondary spending in the arena is as important as the ticket rev-  
enue, so they would rather make sure *someone* gets in by facilitating the  
exchange of unused tickets than make money on the transaction per se.  
According to a survey on Fan Cost Index \[440\], an average major league  
baseball ticket costs \$18.69, but a family of four spends an average of  
\$148.66 for a single game, on souvenirs, snacks, drinks, and program.  
Yet none of this precludes some innovative applications of RM, as we  
discuss next.  
**10.14.3 RM Practice**  
Many microeconomic text books cite movie-ticket discounts for stu-  
dents and seniors as examples of third-degree price discrimination and  
discounts for midweek shows and matinees as examples of peak-load  
pricing. As can be seen from Table 10.13, for this Broadway event there  
are many rate categories with different prices even for the same inven-  
tory type \(akin to airline fare classes in a cabin\) and a price structure  
in the form of discounts off the top rate for the seating area \(akin to  
percentage off the rack rate for hotels\). Notice however that most of the 572 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
rate categories in Table 10.13 are based on identifiable customer char-  
acteristics \(third-degree price discrimination\), so there is a fundamental  
difference between the segmentation as practiced in event ticketing and  
traditional airline RM.  
Nevertheless, whenever the demand exceeds capacity for an event  
space, there is a need to manage the capacity intelligently. Not many  
venues manage their discounted demand in any systematic, scientific  
way. So although at first glance this seems like an industry tailor-  
made for RM, there are relatively few reported implementations in event  
ticketing. The few implementations include opera houses \(San Fran-  
cisco Opera \[479\], Washington Opera \[137\]\), Internet event sellers \(Tick-  
ets.com, \[338\]\), sports teams \(Mariners \[22\], Mets \[454\]\)—and RM has  
been proposed for movies \[409\]. However, even these reports point to  
somewhat tentative and limited implementations in this sector. Fear of  
negative customer reactions and consequent loss of customer goodwill  
are the main reasons firms seem to be avoiding bolder demand manage-  
ment strategies.  
The Washington Opera is one of the pioneers of RM in the opera busi-  
ness. In 1994–1995 it initiated a rate plan consisting of nine categories  
based on the location of the seats \(Table 10.14 shows the 2003–2004  
season prices\). Figure 10.11 shows the physical layout of the various  
categories. In addition, specially priced tickets and group tickets are  
also sold, the former at reduced prices, and the latter at normal prices.  
Subscription tickets are sold the earliest, with those subscribing to more  
shows given first priority. Next come group sales, around three months  
prior to the season beginning. After groups are booked, the box office  
opens for individual sales. Finally, excess demand is sold on the day of  
the performance at student or senior discounts or standing-only. Rather  
than lowering prices for low-demand shows \(thereby upsetting the sub-  
scription customers\), the preferred tactic is bundling where individual  
tickets to popular shows are sold only bundled with low-demand shows.  
So even though prices are fixed *and* there are no capacity controls, there  
is demand management going on—giving preference to customers who  
bring high value \(lifetime value of the customer\) and creating and pricing  
ticket bundles to smooth out demand and increase sales.  
In baseball, the Mets pricing plan, shown in Table 10.15, varies prices  
by game rather than by segmenting customers and controlling capacity  
for each game. So it is more in the spirit of peak-load pricing than tac-  
tical RM. Other baseball teams, such as the Cubs, Yankees, and Giants  
have also implemented similar schemes, in which prices vary by game.  
Notice that significant efficiencies are lost, as prices are set ex ante, once,  
for the whole season, and there is little scope for demand management *Industry Profiles* 573  
on per-game basis. This can be considered a preliminary, experimental,  
step toward a full-fledged RM, and is a significant improvement over uni-  
form pricing. However, the Mets’ management ruled out, for now, the  
possibility of raising and lowering prices for individual games based on  
their popularity \[454\]. Theater and sporting events present some unique  
challenges for RM. For example, as mentioned, the popularity of an  
event or the success of a sports team must be factored into the forecasts  
of demand, which makes for a challenging forecasting. Also, seating in  
theaters suffers from bin-packing effects; having isolated empty seats in  
different locations is not appealing to couples or groups that want to sit  
together, so sales often drop off as a venue fills even though there are  
nominally many available seats. Assigning groups to seats and manag-  
ing the configuration of available blocks of seats therefore becomes an  
important issue. 574 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**10.15 Manufacturing**  
There is significant interest in applying RM in manufacturing. How-  
ever, it is fair to say that to date there have been relatively few implemen-  
tations. But manufacturing is clearly a vast sector of the economy and  
many SCM and ERP technology vendors are starting to offer pricing-  
optimization systems for manufacturers. It therefore warrants careful  
attention.  
**10.15.1 Customers, Products, and Pricing**  
Manufacturing spans a vast and diverse set of firms, so our discus-  
sion here is, of necessity, somewhat generic. A make-to-stock \(MTS\)  
manufacturer produce standardized products, typically in large volumes,  
based on forecasts of future demand. Most consumer goods \(autos, elec-  
tronics, food products, apparel\) fall in this category. A key challenge  
in MTS manufacturers is to balance the need to meet demand, which  
is often variable and uncertain, against inventory and production costs.  
For most MTS manufacturers, pricing tends to be an aggregate deci-  
sion and dynamic pricing is not routinely used to manage supply and  
demand. However, end-of-life-cycle discounting is a common practice  
in many sectors \(such as automotive manufacturer rebates at the end  
of the model year\). Also, trade promotions—discounts given by man-  
ufacturers to retailers and distributors—are a long-established practice  
among many MTS manufacturers. We mentioned one implementation  
of promotion and incentive optimization at Ford Motor Company earlier  
in Section 5.1.2 \[135\]. *Industry Profiles* 575  
A make-to-order \(MTO\) manufacturer generally produces in smaller  
lots based on specific orders from end customers, who are often other  
manufacturers. MTO firms typically have to price a continuous stream  
of bids and request for quotes \(RFQ\). Most of these pricing decisions are  
made manually based on tactical factors, such as estimated costs, as well  
as strategic factors, such as the value of a long-term relationship with  
a buyer. Cost calculations are critical in MTO manufacturing. Such  
calculations are based on estimates of material costs, machine time, and  
labor rates, most often provided by a management accounting system.  
A variety of methods, such as activities-based costing \(ABC\), are used  
to arrive at these cost estimates. The volume of such request is high;  
a pricing department at a large manufacturing company may have to  
respond to over 250,000 RFQs every year.  
Once a bid is accepted, the order is then scheduled into the firm’s pro-  
duction planning and SCM system. SCM systems optimize the schedul-  
ing of current and new orders. Traditionally, they do not consider price  
explicitly as a mechanism to regulate orders, nor do they use price incen-  
tives to shift customer demand away from peak-load periods. Meeting  
the delivery deadlines at the lowest possible cost is the core objective  
of most SCM systems today. However, as mentioned above, many SCM  
vendors are currently working on incorporating price-optimization and  
demand-management functions into their systems, and some already of-  
fer pricing-optimization products. \(See, for example, \[262\].\)  
**10.15.2 RM Practice**  
Because variable costs and production planning are so important in  
manufacturing, manufacturing RM systems must coordinate their data  
and decisions with ERP, SCM, and management-accounting systems.  
Revenue has to be balanced with cost considerations in determining the  
profitability of accepting bids or adjusting prices. The interdependence  
of SCM and RM decisions is well recognized as the main reason why  
SCM vendors are leading the development of RM methods in the man-  
ufacturing sector.  
Manufacturing RM differs from service RM in other important ways as  
well. For example, although idle capacity can be considered a perishable  
item, physical inventory of parts and raw materials can be stored for  
future use. This gives manufacturers more production flexibility. On  
the other hand, in high-tech manufacturing raw materials and parts  
lose valuable rapidly, so there is some degree of perishability. Another  
difference is that a manufacturing order need not be rejected outright;  
rather, it can be delayed, much as a bumped passenger on an overbooked  
flight can be flown on a later flight. As a result, RM can potentially be 576 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
used for demand smoothing, delaying production of low-value demand  
to off-peak times, while ensuring prompt production and delivery of  
high-value demand during peak times.  
The dynamic pricing tactic of choice for MTS manufacturers has been  
trade promotions. This is when the distributors and retailers are given  
a discount \(which may or may not be passed on to consumers\) if they  
buy a certain quantity or if they run a promotion special.  
Applications of RM among MTO manufacturers are growing, with  
several vendors specializing in the area. Product configuration software  
tools \(such as the ones used to order a PC online\) incorporate pric-  
ing information and perform some segmentation \(large business, small  
business, government, and so on\), though most of the technology is  
rules-based. A form of RM where discounts are given based on advance  
purchase, lead-time, and delivery-time flexibility have been proposed in  
the literature, but we know of no major implementations at this stage.  
Applications of configuration-based pricing are reported in the trade lit-  
erature, but few details have been published.  
Finally, dynamic pricing, in the form of Internet auctions, has also had  
a significant impact in manufacturing recently. Excess inventory is now  
routinely auctioned off on the Internet, and procurement departments  
often source supplies \(at least in-direct materials\) from B2B exchanges.  
RM systems are likely to play a role in managing these surplus inventory  
auctions in the future.

# IMPLEMENTATION  
While models and science form the core of a revenue management sys-  
tem, in practice RM success hinges critically on the quality of implemen-  
tation. Implementation involves more than software and hardware, the  
most visible aspects of the system. It requires designing products, align-  
ing incentives and organizational structures, changing business processes  
to support the firm’s RM objectives, and training employees properly.  
In this chapter, we examine these and other RM system-implementation  
issues.  
**11.1 Segmentation and Product Design**  
Segmentation and product design are the first steps in a RM imple-  
mentation. *Segmentation* is the process of classifying customers into  
groups \(segments\) based on observed—or inferred—characteristics, be-  
haviors, and preferences. The objective of segmentation is to understand  
who is buying the product, how they buy, what attributes they value  
\(and don’t value\), and what price they are willing to pay—and then  
to classify them into groups based on these characteristics. Segmen-  
tation is then followed by *product design*, the objective of which is to  
construct bundles of product/service features to target each customer  
segment. Correlating customers’ willingness to pay with their prefer-  
ences and purchase behavior is the key to good product design.  
Segmentation and product design are not operational processes, in the  
sense that they are seldom done on a day-to-day, routine basis \(although  
there is scope for some fine-tuning of products after they are introduced\).  
This affords more time for off-line analysis, but it also means that design  
should be robust and sustainable for a reasonably long period. 580 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
While both customer segmentation and product design are complex,  
data-intensive processes and therefore well suited to analytical meth-  
ods, in practice they are still based primarily on managerial judgment  
and intuition. Yet RM managers are beginning to test analytical tools  
to support product design and to understand customer segments and  
preferences. Here we describe a few simple models and one such tool,  
conjoint analysis.  
**11.1.1 Segmentation**  
As mentioned, the goals of a segmentation analysis are to understand  
which customers are buying, how they buy, what they value, and how  
much they are willing to pay. Its aim is to uncover correlations between  
willingness to pay and segment characteristics and to exploit this seg-  
ment behavior in some practical way that increases revenues. Toward  
this end, the following six criteria are widely used to evaluate a segmen-  
tation strategy \[193, 558\]\:  
**Identifiability** Is it possible to identify customers as belonging to a  
segment, either prepurchase or postpurchase? If not, the segmenta-  
tion, though perhaps conceptually valid, cannot be operationalized.  
**Substantiality** How large is the segment? If segments are too small,  
the costs of segmentation may not justify the benefits, though for  
some online channels the cost of customizing can be quite low.  
**Reachability** Can a segment be targeted by marketing techniques  
or product design? Or can the segment be induced to self-select their  
targeted product? If not, it may be impossible to reach the segment.  
**Stability** Do the segments change rapidly over time? If they do,  
it may be difficult to identify and estimate the characteristics of the  
segment. Stability is also necessary if a firm needs to design relatively  
static products.1  
**Responsiveness** Do customers in the same segment respond simi-  
larly to a product or marketing campaign? That is, are customers  
in each segment approximately homogenous in terms of their pref-  
erences and market response? If not, the resulting response from  
segmentation my be unpredictable or ineffective.  
1Note that stability is not the same as saying a particular customer’s behavior does not  
change\: A customer who travels for both business and pleasure is one whose behavior changes  
depending on the occasion of purchase. However, his behavior fits either that of a business  
segment or leisure segment, and the behavior of the segment itself does not change. *Implementation* 581  
**Actionability** Is it feasible to price or market differently for each  
segment? That is, can we base product design or marketing deci-  
sions on the segmentation? Is the segmentation helpful in terms of  
suggesting practical ways to target customers?  
A particular segmentation strategy should be evaluated along each  
of these criteria. For instance, consider a segmentation of families with  
more than two children. This segmentation might be difficult to reach  
in a direct-marketing campaign to households, but is reachable when  
selling a travel or hospitality product, for example, by giving a discount  
for three or more children. In the latter case, the segment is identifiable,  
substantial, reachable, and actionable. However, it may not necessarily  
prove to be responsive if families of size five or more do not have different  
price sensitivity than other customers.  
**11.1.1.1 Segmentation Bases for RM**  
A *segmentation basis* is the set of product attributes or customer char-  
acteristics that define a segment. For instance, the time of booking is  
a segmentation basis for many RM applications\: a customer who books  
21 days in advance is classified as a leisure customer \(or more precisely,  
*likely* to be a leisure customer\).  
There could be more bases than there are segments. To give an ex-  
ample, a hotel could define only two broad customer segments \(business  
and leisure\) but use a number of different bases in combination \(for in-  
stance, week day, time of booking, source of booking\) to identify the  
customer with different degrees of certainty.  
Note that some bases are observable \(for instance, zip codes because  
of store location\), and some are not \(say, family size\) and have to be in-  
ferred from data such as sales transactions, observed itinerary, and panel  
data. Table 11.2 gives a classification of segment bases as observable or  
unobservable and as customer or product-specific. For any basis that is 582 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
observable, one can distinguish it further depending on whether it can  
be observed at the time of purchase or after purchase. For instance, a  
casino may classify some customers as high-rollers if they spend a lot  
on gambling, but the casino may not know this information at the time  
of purchase unless they used a separate mechanism to track customers  
\(such as a loyalty card\). Table 11.3 lists some common segmentation  
bases used in RM and their characteristics and purpose.  
Quantity-based RM segmentation has some unique features\: cus-  
tomers preferences are not necessarily based on the product itself2 but  
rather on the conditions of purchase \(such as advance-purchase restric-  
tions, nonrefundability\). In fact, one hesitates to use the term *prefer-*  
*ences* in terms of these restrictions because, given the option, everyone  
would unequivocally prefer not to have restrictive conditions on pur-  
chases at all. Rather, some customers simply cannot meet certain pur-  
chase conditions while other customers can, or are willing to meet them  
in exchange for a lower price. The conditions of purchase can include de-  
livery time \(logistics, manufacturing\), preemptability \(advertising\), and  
nonrefundability \(airlines\), among others.  
**11.1.1.2 Segmentation Mechanism**  
There are two basic approaches to constructing a segmentation mech-  
anism. The first is to use an explicit *screening mechanism* based on  
observable characteristics—to restrict products and pricing to individ-  
uals based on their observed “types.” Example of such mechanisms in-  
clude age-based segments \(child’s and senior citizen’s prices\), geographi-  
cal segments \(zonal pricing\), and group affiliation \(corporate discounts\);  
these are all mechanisms that use observable segment bases listed in  
2For service industries, like hotels or airlines, we ignore minor differences in the product \(such  
as view for hotel rooms and legroom for airline seats\). *Implementation* 583 584 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Table 11.2. Such segmentation is equivalent to third-degree price dis-  
crimination as discussed in Section 8.3.3.1.  
The second approach is to use *self-selection segmentation.* This is  
necessary if a firm cannot observe or control which segment buys which  
product. It must attempt to induce customers to self-select the product  
targeted at them, which is the essence of second-degree price discrimi-  
nation as discussed in Section 8.3.3.1. To give an everyday example, in *Implementation* 585  
the consumer packaged-goods industry, price-sensitive customers *choose*  
to use coupons more; and price-sensitive customers with large families  
*choose* to buy in bulk to get savings. When sales are anonymous or  
through third parties, then segmentation by self-selection is often the  
only viable alternative for a firm.  
Using an explicit sorting mechanism to segment is relatively easy from  
an implementation standpoint, though one may face legal and customer  
acceptance issues in the process. With self-selection, legality is rarely  
an issue, but the firm risks a large amount of dilution—many customers  
in one segment ending up purchasing products not designed for them.  
Indeed, there is little a firm can do to prevent a rich consumer cutting  
out coupons or a business traveler staying over a Saturday night to get  
cheaper airfare. Still, the segmentation is considered successful if a *suf-*  
*ficient* number in each segment respond the way the firm had envisioned  
\(substantiability\). It is important, therefore, that the segment not be  
defined too narrowly as customer behavior is hard to predict except in  
an aggregate probabilistic sense. Most RM segmentation is of the self-  
selection type.  
**11.1.2 Product Design**  
Product design is the flip side of segmentation—“differentiating” the  
products to target the identified segments, with the idea of charging  
more for products targeted at customer segments with higher willingness  
to pay. As is the case for customer segmentation, there are very few  
models and analysis techniques currently used for RM product design.  
We present one methodology, conjoint analysis, that has found some  
success as a tool for physical product design and can conceivably used  
to design RM products also.  
**11.1.2.1 Product Design Using Conjoint Analysis**  
*Conjoint analysis* originated from statistical work by Luce and  
Tukey \[348\] and is widely used in marketing \[224, 574\]. Its role has  
expanded, from an initial positive goal of multiattribute utility measure-  
ment, to more normative uses such as new product design, segmentation,  
product positioning, and even pricing.  
Many market-research firms now offer conjoint analysis as a service  
and commercial PC and Web-based software \(Sawtooth Software, SAS\)  
has become widely available to support it. 586 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT* *Implementation* 587  
Conjoint studies are numerous in the CPG and automobile industries,  
and applications of conjoint analysis to design travel and hospitality  
industry facilities, products and amenities have been reported in \[570,  
102, 573, 574, 532, 216\], but we know of no applications of conjoint  
analysis for quantity-based RM product “restriction” design as such. A  
second caveat is that current market environment often guides product  
design\: what products the competition is providing and what prices they  
are charging. This presents an especially vexing problem for RM because  
\(available\) products and prices can change rapidly, making comparisons  
difficult. Barring these two caveats, the methodology has the potential  
to be useful in making rational product-design decisions.  
The customer-behavior model of conjoint analysis is similar to the  
discrete-choice models discussed in Section 7.2.2, both having roots in  
microeconomic theories of preferences. There are *M* possible attributes  
of a product, and the firm can choose the *level* of attribute in designing  
its product. Table 11.4 gives an example of the attributes and their  
levels for a hotel product. The choice of attributes and their levels is  
usually a result of management judgment or analysis of a survey among  
customers. It is advisable to be parsimonious and list only the most  
important attributes and the most reasonable range of their values.  
A *profile* is a particular combination of the *M* attribute levels that  
can make up a potential product, Customers form  
a utility for a product that has the combination of attribute levels **x**.  
The most common model3 used for this utility formation is an additive  
composition of the *part-worths*, of attribute  
One can simplify this further and assume linear part-worth functions  
and a finite set of profiles. So if attribute is assumed to have one of  
levels, the utility of a customer for a profile is hypothesized to be  
is an indicator variable equal to 1 if attribute is at level in the  
profile and 0 otherwise, and is the part-worth for customer for  
the attribute at level We would like to estimate these part-worth  
3Other, more complicated, utility functions have been proposed, but we stick to this popular  
one for ease of exposition. 588 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
functions, so that the utility functions can be used in an optimization  
model for segmentation, product design or pricing.  
The motivation behind conjoint analysis is the following. First, asking  
some sample customers to directly map their part-worths \(say, for price\)  
may be meaningless as they are convolved with all the other attributes.  
As an alternative, we can ask respondents to compare a discrete number  
of profiles, but the number of such profiles can quickly grow large even  
for a small number of attributes and levels. For instance, if there are five  
attributes, each with five different possible levels, then the number of  
possible profiles is an immense number to test out in a survey. Even  
if many of these combinations can be eliminated as being unreasonable,  
we would still typically be left with too many profiles to test, since  
survey participants are unlikely to respond reliably to more than 5 to 10  
rating questions at a time. To overcome this problem, conjoint surveys  
use experimental design techniques to construct an orthogonal subset of  
profiles for each respondent that is parsimonious yet ensures the results  
are statistically significant.  
Next, even if presented a profile, most respondents are not able to  
give a utility value for each one, let alone break utilities down into part-  
worths. Rather, what a survey can meaningfully do is to ask respondents  
to compare one profile with another and rate which one they like better—  
or, given a set of profiles, pick the one they like best. The seminal work of  
Luce and Tukey \[348\] lays out the statistical methodology of extracting  
the part-worth measurements \(or parameters of a hypothesized utility  
model\) given only rankings data from a group of participants.  
Current conjoint analysis software programs automate this analysis.  
A designer chooses a model and creates the relevant attributes and lev-  
els. The software then presents profiles to each survey participant and  
extracts part-worths based on statistical analysis of the resulting rank-  
ings data. The software is typically PC or Web-based and simulates  
a realistic choice environment by presenting graphics, images, or even  
videos.  
Once the part-worth utilities have been extracted, they can be put  
to many uses. For example, the customer population can be segmented  
based on their part-worths \(such as nonsmokers and exercise buffs for  
a hotel\). One can also estimate the price sensitivity of each segment  
separately or design special marketing programs based on each segment’s  
part-worths. A customer-behavior model can be fit using the utilities  
for various products under consideration, and their market shares and  
profitability can be estimated in a market-simulation model. Finally,  
product assortments can be designed for optimal positioning and overall  
profitability. *Implementation* 589  
Our brief description here glosses over many details and decisions  
involved in a conjoint study\: for example, whether to do pairwise com-  
parison of attributes or full profiles; whether respondents should rate  
their preferences \(say, on a scale of 1 to 10\) or rank-order profiles \(first  
choice, second choice, and so on\). The interested reader should consult  
the references at the end of this chapter for such details.  
**11.1.2.2 RM Product Design Model**  
As mentioned, few firms currently utilize models to design their RM  
products. Nevertheless, it is conceptually useful to formulate the prob-  
lem as an optimization problem to understand the many factors that  
impact product design.  
Consider designing a set of *K* RM products for one particular resource  
with a capacity of *C.*4 RM products are distinguished by the restric-  
tions. Let there be *M* bases of restrictions \(such as advance-purchase  
restrictions, min-stay, max-stay \(see Table 11.3\)\). For each basis, there  
are multiple possibilities for creating a restriction. For example, for the  
advance-purchase basis, a RM product can use a restriction of three-day  
advance-purchase, seven-day advance-purchase and so on, or none at all.  
A RM product is composed of a set of restrictions, one along each basis.  
Let represent a collection of sets, with each set being a combination  
of *M* restrictions. Our design problem is then to pick *K* sets of restric-  
tions from fix prices for the *K* products, and in addition, decide on  
the portion of the capacity *C* to allocate to each of the  
*K* products \(representing RM capacity controls\).  
of course, could grow exponentially with the number of bases and  
the number of potential restriction values along each basis. In practice  
the number of bases would be small, and the number of values along  
each bases, four or five; hence, the size of would be within reasonable  
limits.  
The *M* bases and their values can be represented in an *M*-dimensional  
space. The potential restriction values create a grid in this *M* dimen-  
sional space with each block in the grid representing a potential product.  
Figure 11.1 gives an example of a 2-dimensional grid representing the  
product space with the advance-purchase and max-stay segmentation  
bases.  
Let there be *N* customers. Each customer has a set of valuations  
for the products in This valuation could be represented by  
4*K* is considered an exogenous number fixed a priori by the firm. Alternatively, *K* could  
be an endogenous decision variable and we could model a fixed cost for introducing each  
additional product. 590 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
customer’s valuation for product This however would create esti-  
mation difficulties, so below we use a simpler additive model in the spirit  
of the conjoint utility model of Section 11.1.  
Let customer have an *ideal point* defined as follows\: it is the most  
restrictive product for which he has his maximum valuation. For ex-  
ample, in Figure 11.1, customer uncertainty about his trip is resolved  
somewhere between 7 and 14 days before his trip date, and his trip  
takes more than 6 days and less than 1 month. Then his ideal point is  
represented by the potential product with restrictions of max-stay of 1  
month and advance-purchase restriction of 7 days. Let his valuation for  
the product at this ideal point be If however, for reasons of price or  
availability, he is forced to purchase 14 days in advance, his willingness  
to pay would be lower. We model this as a reduction in valuation for  
purchasing less-than-ideal products.  
Let represent the disutility for a customer whose ideal point is  
product if he has to purchase product \(It is conceivable that this  
reduction is zero, especially when a customer purchases a less restrictive  
product.\) If consumer ideal product is then his net utility for pur-  
chasing product is given by where is the price charged  
by the firm for product So far we have assumed all the valuations  
and are deterministic, but they could also be modeled as random  
variables to be more realistic. To keep the exposition simple, we assume *Implementation* 591  
deterministic valuations \(see Talluri \[502\] for extension to stochastic pri-  
vate valuations\). To keep things even simpler, the disutilities be taken as the sum of the reductions along each basis between can  
and  
Figure 11.2 shows the graphic of the customer utility model.  
If *all* the customers have the same deterministic valuation \(equiv-  
alently, there is a single segment\), RM is not really necessary; the firm  
would just sell a single unrestricted product at a price This is be-  
cause of the nature of RM products—customers will very likely have a  
disutility of zero for purchasing a less restrictive product, and the firm  
is better off not reducing the valuations by imposing restrictions.  
So to justify designing multiple products the market should have mul-  
tiple segments with different valuations and different disutilities  
for the restrictions. We can define segments as groups of customers who  
have identical valuations for their ideal products and identical disutility  
functions.5 The firm can then use the multiple products to separate  
5It would be more appropriate to model the valuations \(for each segment\) as random variables  
\(from the firm’s point of view\), in which case the distinct segments will be groups with distinct 592 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
high valuation and low valuation customers. So, RM product design  
can be thought of as an optimal segmentation problem—taking a set of  
underlying segments \(defined only by variations in their valuations and  
disutilities\) and their purchase preferences \(ideal points\) and creating  
*K* segments \(and, of course, the consequent operational problem of allo-  
cating capacity to the *K* resulting products\). For the moment, assume  
that valuations are deterministic and there is a single segment. The de-  
scription that follows generalizes to multiple segments in a transparent  
way.  
Let be the number of customers whose ideal point is product  
The firm’s decision problem is to come up with prices and allocations  
subject to and  
is taken to imply product is not offered, so designing *K* RM  
products amounts to the restriction that at most *K* of the have  
non-negative values.  
The firm’s objective function then is given by  
represents the actual demand observed by the firm. We discuss how  
this is formed shortly. The restriction on number of products are cap-  
tured by adding the following integer programming constraints to \(11.2\).  
Let be a binary decision variable such that  
Then, these restrictions are modeled by  
Customers are utility maximizers in the sense that they will purchase  
the product \(among the available products\) that gives them the maxi-  
mum positive net utility. The consumer’s decision is of course influenced  
by the prices and allocations set by the firm.  
Let be a binary variable equal to 1 if a customer with ideal point  
purchases and 0 otherwise Let *B* be a sufficiently  
distributions of valuations. The notion of “distinct” is necessarily vague. The definition is  
akin to cluster analysis, where we want to define distinct clusters that are similar within the  
cluster and as dissimilar as possible across the clusters. *Implementation* 593  
large number \(say \> \). The customer decision making is modeled as  
follows. Let be the net utility of a customer with ideal  
point purchasing product at price A customer with ideal point  
ranks and chooses the highest available one, provided his net  
utility is nonnegative. This is the equivalent to saying if then  
Notice not all customers are assured of being able to buy the product  
\(even if they have some product with positive net utility\) because of  
rationing. We capture the utility maximization of customers by the  
following set of linear integer programming constraints added to \(11.2\).  
The set of constraints \(11.5a–11.5f\) model demand as follows\: \(11.5a\)says that customer buys at most one product; \(11.5b\) that if net utility  
for customer \(with ideal point \) to purchase is less than zero, then  
he does not purchase \(11.5c\) gives the total demand for product  
as sum of all the customers who choose \(11.5d\) sets the number of  
customers with ideal point as Finally, \(11.5e\) and \(11.5f\) impose  
the utility-maximizing condition that for customer if then  
unless there is no remaining capacity for is a binary  
variable, equal to 1 if product is not available for customer \(it had  
been sold out to other customers\) and 0 if there is available capacity for  
product \(11.5f\) sets the values for  
The above linear integer program captures many important elements  
of RM such as utility-maximizing customers, customer preferences, prices  
and restrictions \(even if it is rather hopeless to solve—at least in its  
entirety—in practice\). Note that customers are not strategic as in Sec-  
tion 5.5.2—they do not change their purchase behavior anticipating the  
firm’s or other customers’ actions. As with any posted price mecha-  
nism, the sequence of arrivals of the customers makes a difference \(high  
valuation before low, etc.\). The integer programming formulation here 594 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
assumes the best possible ordering \(from the firm’s revenue-maximizing  
point of view\).  
**11.2 System Architecture, Hardware, Software,**  
# and Interfaces  
RM is a computationally intensive process. Huge amounts of data  
have to be collected and stored in databases. It must then be extracted  
and processed by the forecasting system to make thousands of forecasts  
on a daily basis. Finally, the optimization module uses the forecasts to  
come up with detailed quantity or price controls or both. Both forecast-  
ing and optimization can be computationally intensive tasks.  
Figure 11.3 shows the flow of a nightly batch-process RM system.  
Figure 11.5 \(repeated from Chapter 1\) illustrates a prototypical process  
flow of RM. The steps involved in a forecasting module for an airline ap-  
plication \(under the independent-demand model covered in Section 7.1\)  
are shown in Figure 11.4, and the steps involved in the processing of a  
reservation request to a GDS are shown in Figure 11.8.  
**11.2.1 Hardware Requirements**  
Hardware requirements for RM systems can be immense.6 That said,  
not every firm needs a million-dollar mainframe to run RM software.  
Some of the smaller, simpler applications \(say, in a medium-size hotel\)  
can be run on a PC. A multiprocessor database server and a powerful  
workstation for forecasting and optimization are usually sufficient for all  
but the largest RM systems. Current RM systems run on a large variety  
of platforms, from stand-alone PCs to Unix workstations and servers  
to mainframes. Reliability, redundancy, and good back-up procedures  
are important as RM is a mission-critical application; if a RM system is  
down, critical controls are not being set properly, which could lead to a  
significant loss of revenue.  
**11.2.2 User-Interface Design**  
The user interface \(UI\) is an important component of a RM system.  
They serve as the analysts’ “window” on both market conditions and the  
RM system’s response to these conditions. As mentioned in Chapter 1,  
RM is a man-machine process, with systems automating most of the  
routine decisions but under the oversight of analysts who intervene as  
necessary to respond to unusual market conditions or system errors. The  
6United Airlines, to take a case in point, is reported to use several of IBM’s “deep blue”  
supercomputers for portions of its RM system. *Implementation* 595  
ability of an analyst to interact effectively and productively with a RM  
system hinges on the quality of the UI design.  
While the primary functionality of the UI is to allow analysts to ana-  
lyze and monitor RM system controls and forecasts, the UI should also  
enforce security, so that only users with permissions have access to a spe-  
cific functionality. For instance, analysts for a particular market should  
be prevented from overriding controls on markets outside their respon-  
sibility. Administrators should have the ability to maintain databases,  
set passwords, or otherwise monitor activity. In short, the UI supports  
all the basic functionality of the system \(user administration, groups,  
forecasts, prices, availabilities, controls\). 596 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Many hotel, rental-car, ferry, and cruise-line RM systems feature a  
color-coded calendar screen, with information on exceptions, booking  
curves, special events, and occupancy data. Alerts come with colors,  
sounds, and other notifications. As with any UI, ease-of-use and effi-  
ciency are important, as they reduce training costs and the chance that  
analysts will make mistakes.  
At a technical level, the UI of most RM systems is written in one  
of any number of commercial programming languages including Visual  
Basic, Power Builder, C++, Motif \(Unix\) and Java/XML/HTML. Some  
older systems still use a DOS interface. *Implementation* 597  
The current trend is to have a Web interface for both analysts as well  
as system administrators, and therefore, Java/XML is the language of  
choice in UI design. With a Web interface, no special software needs to  
be installed on the client machines; any standard browser can be used 598 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
to download and run the interface. Administration and control can be  
performed remotely as well, since only an Internet connection is needed.  
This is especially useful for a firm such as a hotel chain, which has to  
manage physically dispersed properties. Managers at the properties can  
access the system through a browser. In theory, the Web UI can be  
viewed from any browser, although in practice differences in browser  
versions, platforms, and capabilities create their own problems.  
Figures 11.6 and 11.7 show two examples of RM software user  
interfaces—a screen shot of a quantity-based RM for the airline industry  
and a screen shot of a markdown pricing-optimization software system.  
**11.2.3 GDS, CRS, and PMS Interfaces**  
Hotels, airlines, and rental-car companies receive a substantial num-  
ber of their bookings through global distribution systems \(GDSs\). The  
GDSs communicate with a firm’s reservation system \(host CRS for an  
airline or directly to the property management system \(PMS\) of a hotel\),  
either periodically or for each booking request, to query for availability,  
retrieve passenger records, or process bookings \(see Section 11.2.3.2 on  
seamless availability\). Different GDSs are popular in different parts of *Implementation* 599  
the world. Table 11.5 gives a list of the major GDSs and their owners \(as  
of 1998\). GDSs charge per transaction \(with different fees for different  
types of transactions\) or per booking. GDS fees can quickly add range  
anywhere from 2% to 8% of distribution costs \[191\]. Because some GDSs  
are owned by airlines themselves and the order in which flights appear on  
travel agents’ screens affects sales, there have been persistent concerns  
in the industry that GDSs are biased in favor of their owners \[410\]. In  
response to these concerns, today all GDSs are governed by regulations  
that attempt to ensure there is no such display bias. The governing  
rules also specify that any data generated by the system be available to  
all participants at equal and reasonable fees. The latter requirement is  
important because GDSs sell market share and sales data that can be  
used in RM systems.  
**11.2.3.1 GDS Interface Technology**  
The host CRS or PMS and GDSs interact thousands of times a day  
as travel agencies and other distributors \(for instance, the switch com-  
panies in the hotel industry\) query the CRS for availability and make 600 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
bookings. The communication to and from GDSs follow standard pro-  
tocols \(such as TCP/IP or X25\) and can occur over dedicated or shared  
lines or even dial-up modems; essentially the client computer connects  
to the mainframe of the GDS and exchanges messages in each session.  
Table 11.6 gives a sample of an availability request for airline seats in  
its software form and in raw-data format. Hotel PMSs and rental-car  
reservation systems communicate in a similar fashion using industry-  
specific messages. Many of these message formats have EDI origins  
\(Section 11.2.4.3\), following data layouts similar to industry EDI stan-  
dards, though each GDS can have significant variations or may even use  
its own proprietary message formats. The RM system may occasionally *Implementation* 601  
need to communicate directly with the GDS, but more often, the RM  
system communicates only with the firm’s own host reservation system.  
Prior to the forecasting and optimization run, the RM system needs  
to download the total current reservations and remaining capacities. Ta-  
ble 11.7 shows some sample data tables from a hotel PMS used by a RM  
system. Similar, albeit more complex, tables exist in an airline CRS.  
Most PMS vendors license their data dictionaries to interface with RM  
systems. Table 11.8 shows the fields of a bid price implementation of  
a hotel PMS. The RM system periodically updates this table with new  
values. For interfaces, there has been an industry push recently to XML  
and other open messaging standards. This trend parallels the emergence  
of Internet sales channels. Internet travel sites may either query a GDS  
for availability or interface directly with the firm’s CRS or PMS. 602 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**11.2.3.2 Seamless Availability**  
*Seamless availability* is a technology for real-time communications be-  
tween the host \(internal\) reservation system and \(external\) GDSs in the  
travel and transportation industry. It is a messaging standard devel-  
oped under the auspices of IATA and is part of the EDI standards. The  
standards development body is a group called PADIS \(Passenger and  
Airport Data Interchange Standards\), and all new messaging standards  
have to be approved by its board.  
The purpose of seamless availability is to replace periodic, batch up-  
loads of static availability controls with real-time availability queries to *Implementation* 603  
the host reservation system. Because the host reservation system has  
the most up-to-date information, by consulting it in real time the GDSs  
are able to provide travel agents and customers with accurate price and  
availability data.  
Beyond the mechanics of encryption, data transfer, packaging, and  
hand-shakes, the main contents of a seamless-availability messages are  
\(1\) information on the travel request from the GDS to the airline and  
\(2\) information on price and availability from the airline to the GDS.  
Figure 11.9 shows two typical messages between an airline and GDS.  
Seamless availability provides several advantages. For one, it allows  
the airline to base its accept/deny decisions on passenger characteristics  
\(reducing the anonymity of the transaction somewhat\) such as point of  
sale and frequent-flyer number. It also reduces errors in pricing and  
availability. Seamless availability also helps enforce *married logic,* a sys- 604 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
tem whereby flights can only be sold and cancelled as units.7 Finally, it  
allows airlines to track rudimentary “click” behavior.  
Seamless availability comes at a cost, though. To provide a response  
within the prescribed time limits, a firm usually needs to set up dedi-  
cated communication links and hardware. Also, GDSs charge more to  
implement this feature as it puts a heavy strain on their own systems.  
**11.2.3.3 GDS Abuse in the Travel Industry**  
While RM is not directly concerned with the inner workings of a GDS,  
limitations of GDSs often create challenges for a RM system implemen-  
tation. One potential problem is abuse by travel agents. To give an  
example, if a GDS stores a multisegment itinerary as independent seg-  
7 *Married logic* is an airline industry practice to counter travel agents abusing the system by  
booking an itinerary to get cheaper fares and then cancelling part of the itinerary. *Implementation* 605  
ments, and if the fare for an O-D itinerary is lower than one of its con-  
stituent components \(not uncommon in market-based pricing, as there  
may be competition on the O-D but not on the segments\), a travel agent  
may be able to book the multisegment itinerary and cancel the unnec-  
essary segment later. Or a travel agent may be able to book a block  
of seats on a fictional PNR to lock in cheap fares and then later fill in  
the passenger details or cancel them at will. A travel agent may be also  
able to make reservation on one GDS, then transfer it to another, and  
issue the tickets on the new GDS, doubling the GDS costs. And so on.  
The list of possible GDS abuses is endless and causes significant revenue  
leakage to airlines. Some of these are plain flaws in the product and  
restriction design, but if the GDS has limitations in implementation, a  
clever travel agent can always find ways around any restriction.  
While the large airlines monitor travel-agency behavior and penalize  
violating firms \(say, by cutting discounts\), smaller airlines and hotels  
have little leverage to prevent these practices. In response, many RM  
systems have added functionality—and at times rather ad-hoc features—  
to prevent GDS flaws. For instance, as mentioned, airlines use married-  
segment logic to prevent agents from booking a through itinerary as  
two locals or from booking a through itinerary and then cancelling one  
segment to gain availability on a local flight. Managers in charge of the  
RM system must have a good working knowledge of the GDSs in order  
to intervene appropriately to prevent such abuse.  
**11.2.4 Retail Management Systems**  
Point-of-sale \(POS\) transaction databases are the central source of  
information for retail RM. These systems collect information from the  
point of sale, that—combined with product, inventory, price, and promo-  
tion information—gives a highly accurate picture of all shopping trans-  
actions in a store. A retail store management system \(RMS\) consists of  
a number of elements\: POS terminals with attached bar-code readers,  
databases with product and inventory information, and EDI to connect  
to suppliers’ ERP and supply-chain systems.  
**11.2.4.1 Bar Codes and POS Systems**  
Optical-scanner technology has revolutionized retail management. Al-  
most all retail products today are encoded by a Universal Product Code  
\(UPC\),8 a code consisting of 12 digits. The first digit represents the  
8There are various flavors of UPC, but we describe the simplest and earliest one, what is called  
version A. Other standards include EAN \(European Article Numbering\), JAN \(Japanese  
Article Numbering\), ISBN, and code 39. 606 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
product type, the next five the manufacturer’s code, the next five the  
product code and finally, a digit is reserved for check sum. The dig-  
its are encoded into bars and spaces that are read by bar-code readers.  
There have been many advances in bar-code technology, but essentially  
bar-code readers first scan and decode the bars and spaces to the correct  
UPC digits and then transmit the information to the retail system.  
POS terminals are simply computer- and communication-enabled cash  
registers. They are connected to the bar-code and card \(debit and credit  
and shop loyalty cards\) readers on one end for fast, error-free check-out,  
and on the other end, to the store retail systems for real-time price  
lookups and updates to the inventory. As soon as the bar-code reader  
scans in an item, the POS system sends a PLU \(price look up\) query to  
the database to get unit price, tax, discount, and promotion information.  
Thus, the exact price \(including shop discounts and coupons\), time of  
sale, and shopping-basket composition are all recorded.  
**11.2.4.2 Pricing and Inventory Modules**  
The RMS database usually consists of the following tables\: inven-  
tory, products, transactions, suppliers, purchasing, promotions, goods,  
customers, orders, contacts, and users, as well as others related to em-  
ployees, and store layouts. On the pricing and promotions side, some  
tasks that a typical RMS can perform are given in Table 11.9.  
**11.2.4.3 Electronic Data Interchange \(EDI\)**  
In many business transactions, the output from one computer appli-  
cation is an input to another application. For instance, a purchase order  
by a retailer is an order entry for a manufacturer; an availability request  
by a reservation system is a query to a hotel bid price server. How-  
ever, the formats and structure of the data required by each application  
can differ considerably. In order for applications to communicate, they  
must adopt a common format for data interchange. EDI provides such  
formatting standards.  
Using EDI standards, a developer can create one single EDI inter-  
face that any application can understand. This promotes a low-cost,  
efficient way for multiple partners to implement automated transac-  
tions. EDI allows applications to “talk” to other applications, broadcast  
queries across multiple partners or otherwise communicate on a “many-  
to-many” basis.  
EDI is a global standard, governed internationally by the United  
Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business  
\(UN/CEFACT\) with participation by regional and national standards  
bodies \(in the U.S., the Accredited Standards Committee \(ASC\)\). EDI *Implementation* 607  
is technology independent and uses agreed-on message codes and struc-  
tures to provide a secure and seamless exchange of data between trading  
partners. It is further extended by various industry-specific groups‚ each  
developing messaging standards suitable for their industry. There are  
standards for the retail‚ manufacturing‚ and travel and tourism indus-  
tries. Most messaging between retailers and manufacturers‚ between  
reservation systems and travel providers occurs using EDI standards.  
EDI software is usually present as a module in enterprise applications  
and most retail systems and ERP applications have EDI modules built  
in.  
The EDI standard for the travel‚ tourism‚ and leisure industry is called  
Unicorn. It is based on the traditional EDI “batch” message construc-  
tion‚ although a more interactive version is also being developed by the  
standards body at the time of this writing.  
Unicorn messages support the following business applications\:  
Product information‚ enquiries‚ tariffs‚ schedules‚ and availability‚  
Making of reservations‚  
Enquiry on‚ amendment to‚ or cancellation of reservations‚ 608 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Pricing‚ ticketing‚ and production of similar documents‚ and  
Free text.  
The Unicorn message set includes air‚ ferry‚ rail‚ most types of ac-  
commodation‚ car hire‚ package holidays‚ insurance‚ for sale of associ-  
ated travel products and financial transactions such as statements and  
payment remittances. In addition‚ there are messages that allow the re-  
mote printing of travel documents‚ such as paper tickets and automated  
ticketing and boarding \(ATB2\). Any principal‚ agent‚ intermediary‚ or  
service provider is free to use a Unicorn message. Table 11.10 shows the  
functionality of Unicorn messaging.  
**11.3 Revenue-Opportunity Assessment and**  
# Revenue-Benefits Measurement  
Because RM systems are expensive‚ time-consuming to implement‚  
and require organizational changes that are disruptive to normal op-  
erations‚ it is natural for senior management to question whether the  
benefits justify the costs. It is important‚ therefore‚ to analyze a RM  
investment before implementation and then later‚ after the system is up  
and running‚ to validate the system benefits. The first type of analysis‚  
performed during the preimplementation phase‚ is called the *revenue-*  
*opportunity assessment* and the latter‚ done post-implementation‚ is  
called *revenue-benefits measurement.* Most RM vendors perform a revenue-  
opportunity assessment as part of an engineering study phase and follow  
up with a benefits measurement study after system cutover.  
**11.3.1 Revenue-Opportunity Assessment**  
There are two basic approaches to revenue-opportunity assessment.  
The first is based on a *perfect-hindsight estimate* of revenue potential.  
This estimate is constructed as follows. First‚ historical data is ana-  
lyzed‚ and corrections for censoring are made to estimate the control-  
unconstrained underlying demand. In a price-based RM setting‚ one fits  
demand functions directly to historical data based on observed price re-  
sponses. Given this *a posteriori* estimate of demand‚ it is then possible  
to analyze the quantity or price controls that *would have* been optimal  
with perfect knowledge of demand. In quantity-based RM‚ this usually  
involves solving a deterministic linear integer program as discussed in  
Section 3.3.1 to optimally allocate capacity; in price-based RM‚ deter-  
ministic dynamic-pricing models of the type discussed in Section 5.2.1  
can be used. *Implementation* 609 610 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
These perfect-hindsight calculations then form an \(estimated\) upper  
bound on the revenue that might have been obtained in the past. Com-  
paring this estimated maximum revenue to the historical revenue pro-  
vides a measure of the potential gain. While this number clearly over-  
estimates the revenue gains of a real system‚ it is common to assume  
some fraction of this potential gain is achievable. Often these estimated  
revenue gains are quite large‚ so even if the system achieves only a frac-  
tion of the gain‚ it provides more than enough justification for a RM  
investment.  
The second methodology used for revenue-opportunity assessment is  
simulation. \(See Section 11.4.\) Simulation is more time-consuming but  
arguably more accurate in gauging potential revenue gains because in a  
simulation study it is possible to model consumer behavior‚ and repli-  
cate the exact forecasting and optimization methods being proposed. A  
simulation model can also model uncertainty and mimic salient features  
of the sales practices. Unlike historical perfect-hindsight studies‚ simula-  
tion can also be used to evaluate “what if” scenarios that have not been  
observed in the past. The disadvantage of simulation is that one must  
make a series of modeling assumptions‚ which may or may not reflect  
real-world conditions. Thus‚ it is important to get management approval  
of the model’s validity prior to doing a detailed simulation study.  
**11.3.2 Revenue-Benefits Measurement**  
While in principle the benefits from a RM system should match the  
numbers given out by the revenue-opportunity assessment‚ this is rarely  
the case in practice. But this is to be expected. For one‚ business con-  
ditions change rapidly\: recessions‚ economic shocks \(wars\) and currency  
changes all have a bigger impact than the effects of a RM system. In-  
deed‚ in RM one is often trying to measure benefits of the order of 1%  
to 2%‚ which can easily get washed out by even a mild demand shock  
or change in competitive conditions. Nevertheless‚ it is important to do  
such a study to attempt to validate the performance of a RM system.  
And it is best to aim for as unbiased a measurement as possible‚ ideally  
by a “neutral” internal team or an outside third-party.  
Benefits measurement can and should be based on actual data. For  
this reason‚ it is important to collect and store all relevant data \(prices  
and products‚ competitor prices and products‚ customer booking records‚  
allocations\) for a significant period—both prior to and after implemen-  
tation of the RM system. The preimplementation data serves as the  
baseline for comparison. By collecting data over a long period‚ there is  
a better chance of being able to pick a period that is relatively stable or  
free from major outside shocks. *Implementation* 611  
If there are major changes in the marketplace or economic conditions‚  
benefits measurement becomes more difficult and potentially fraught  
with controversy. The data should ideally be “corrected” to account for  
these changes‚ but such corrections are difficult to make. So the judg-  
ment‚ fairness‚ and skills of the managers‚ statisticians‚ and consultants  
involved in the study play an important role in the credibility of the  
numbers.  
One way to avoid such controversies is to perform a parallel test of the  
new system versus the old system. That is‚ selectively apply the new RM  
system to a sample of products and markets while continuing to manage  
the remaining products and markets with the old system and procedures.  
This allows for a controlled experiment of the revenue performance of  
the new and old systems under the same economic conditions. Many  
RM vendors use this approach‚ especially for first-time adopters of RM.  
Of course‚ this approach has some drawbacks. One has to take care  
that the selected products and markets are representative of the total  
population and that analysts behave as “normally” as possible when us-  
ing each system. And it may be technically or operationally difficult to  
try to run two systems in parallel. But the results of such side-by-side  
comparisons are often much more credible than those based on compar-  
ing performance of an entire system pre- and post-implementation.  
Whichever approach is used for benefits measurement‚ it is impor-  
tant that such studies not be undertaken solely as a reward and valida-  
tion process. Rather‚ they should be also viewed as an opportunity for  
process improvement—as a way to find and fix hidden bugs in the system  
or to determine areas where the system and models can be improved.  
As such‚ benefits measurement should ideally be part of a continuous  
improvement process.  
In addition to revenue measurements‚ senior management is usually  
interested in tracking before and after measures along a number of di-  
mensions. Table 11.11 lists some commonly used performance measures  
that are tracked pre- and post-implementation.  
**11.4 RM Simulation**  
As mentioned‚ simulation is a flexible and powerful methodology to  
evaluate RM system performance. It is also useful in basic R&D studies  
to evaluate the performance of new forecasting and optimization meth-  
ods. Here‚ we look briefly at some RM-specific simulation issues.  
The idea of simulation is to mimic both the customer demand process  
and the RM system responses to this simulated demand. A variety of  
questions can be addressed using a simulation study‚ such as\: What is  
the potential revenue impact of changing to a new forecasting or opti- 612 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
mization system? What are the benefits of moving from a leg-level con-  
trol to a network-level control? What is the revenue difference between  
different types of controls\: Bid-price control or virtual nesting control?  
How robust is the system to errors in forecasting? How much revenue  
is lost by bad or biased forecasts? What are the revenue impacts of dif-  
ferent types of customer-choice behavior \(including sell-ups and revenue  
dilution\)? And so on. The ability to provide detailed answers to such a  
wide range of questions is the main advantages of simulation.  
For the results of a simulation study to be meaningful‚ the program  
has to model the current business and control processes and the planned  
processes as accurately as possible. Customer booking streams are nor-  
mally generated using a pseudo-random number generator based on his-  
torical booking patterns. A simulation clock governs the progress of  
the simulation. At various points in time‚ one or more *events* occur.  
For example‚ events for a quantity-based RM simulation include book-  
ing requests‚ cancellations‚ no-shows‚ and optimization and forecasting  
runs. For a price-based RM simulation‚ events include price changes‚  
customer arrivals‚ and purchase decisions \(purchase‚ delay purchase‚ or  
no-purchase\).  
By carefully modeling the firm’s sale practices and customer behav-  
ior‚ a reasonably accurate picture of revenue benefits can be obtained  
via simulation. But even at its best‚ it is important to remember that  
a simulation is only an abstraction of a real system—and it can only *Implementation* 613  
represent phenomena that the analyst programs into it. Thus‚ the level  
of detail it provides can give a false sense of precision. Such caveats  
aside‚ simulation remains by far the most common method in practice  
for evaluating RM systems.  
**11.4.1 Generating Aggregate Number of**  
# Customers  
Pseudo-random number generators are used for generating arrivals  
according to a specified distribution. While there are many subtleties  
involved in the algorithms used to generate pseudo-random numbers‚ a  
suite of well tested‚ fast‚ and stable algorithms have emerged over time  
that have good statistical properties. The basic pseudo-random number  
generators generate a random number uniformly distributed between 0  
and 1. Prom this uniform random variable‚ a number of general tech-  
niques \(such as transformation methods or rejection methods \[429\]\) can  
be used to generate random numbers from a wide variety of distributions.  
**11.4.2 Generating the Customer-Arrival Pattern**  
In RM‚ the timing and order of customer arrivals has an impact on  
revenue gains. For instance‚ whether customers with a high willingness  
to pay arrive before those with low willingness to pay has an impor-  
tant effect on revenue as well as the effectiveness of the forecasting or  
optimization methods. For this reason‚ the RM simulation should be  
able to generate customer arrivals following the observed patterns for  
the various segments.  
Mathematically‚ for each simulation run‚ we would like to generate a  
random number from a target probability distribution \(such as a left-  
truncated normal distribution\) representing the total number of cus- 614 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
tomers of a particular segment‚ and then distribute these arrivals over  
the sale period‚ following a given arrival pattern. To avoid confusion  
with the distribution of the total number of customers‚ we call the dis-  
tribution over time an *arrival pattern.*  
The following procedure achieves this objective. First‚ generate a  
random number from the \(assumed\) distribution for the total number  
of arrivals‚ representing the aggregate number of customers. Then for  
each one of these customers‚ generate their arrival time by considering  
the arrival-pattern curve as a cumulative distribution over time. That  
is‚ generate a uniform random variable between 0 and 1 and use the  
inverse of the given arrival pattern to generate an arrival time‚ as shown  
in Figure 11.10.  
While this procedure gives a distribution of customers over time that  
conforms to both the aggregate demand distribution as well as the arrival  
pattern‚ it is important to note that the number of arrivals will not‚ in  
general‚ be independent across disjoint time intervals. Put another way‚  
a RM forecasting system could gain an advantage by basing its forecasts  
on observed demand to date‚ since the expectation of future demand  
conditional on observed demand may be different from the unconditional  
expected demand. Whether this is as it should be is a matter of debate  
among RM professionals‚ but one should be aware that with arbitrary  
distributions‚ biases may be introduced into a simulation by using an  
unconditional distribution when forecasting demand to come.9  
**11.5 Customer Perceptions and Reactions**  
While firms‚ for understandable reasons‚ may be enthusiastic about  
RM‚ they may find that their customers are less so. Here we discuss  
strategies for making RM more palatable in the eyes of customers.  
**11.5.1 RM Perception Problems**  
One well-reported incident that highlights the potential customer per-  
ception problems with RM occurred in the fall of 2000 when Amazon.com  
conducted a price experiment‚ quoting different prices on DVDs to dif-  
ferent customers. Several customers discovered the practice by logging  
onto Amazon.com’s site at different times. What they found‚ which  
Amazon.com later confirmed‚ was that customers were given random  
discounts of between 20% and 40% on selected DVDs. For example‚  
during one online price test conducted by the *E-Commerce Times‚* the  
**9**If aggregate demand is Poisson‚ however‚ then the unconditional distribution of demand to  
come is the same as the conditional distribution. *Implementation* 615  
price for the DVD *Mission Impossible* was offered for sale at \$17.99‚ a  
40% discount off list price; several hours later‚ the price had risen to  
\$20.99.10  
The incident was picked up quickly by the press and created signif-  
icant negative publicity for Amazon.com. The following are some cus-  
tomer reactions to Amazon.com’s dynamic pricing experiment \(*Source\:*  
DVDtalk.com\)\:  
This is a very strange business model‚ to charge customers more when they  
buy more or come back to the site more.  
I find this extremely sneaky and unethical.  
If you walk into a store‚ you aren’t charged more based on how many times  
you pick up the DVD to look at the cover‚ are you?  
\(Amazon.com is a\) shyster.  
Amazon.com denied setting prices based on customers’ past purchases  
or demographic information. According to Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos\:  
We’ve never tested and we never will test prices based on customer demo-  
graphics. What we did was a random price test‚ and even that was a mistake  
because it created uncertainty for customers rather than simplifying their  
lives.11  
And on September 27‚ 2000‚ Amazon issued a statement regarding the  
price test of early September\:  
Price testing was not based on customer demographic information. These re-  
ports were incorrect and were not based on the facts. We have never tested  
and we never will test prices based on customer demographics. Contrary to  
these reports‚ Amazon varied the discount levels on a totally random basis.  
The purpose of the test was to determine how much sales are affected by  
lower prices. In retrospect‚ this random testing was a mistake‚ and we regret  
it because it created uncertainty and complexity for our customers‚ and our  
job is to simplify shopping for customers. That is why‚ more than two weeks  
ago in response to customer feedback‚ we changed our policy to protect cus-  
tomers should we ever do random price testing again \(and currently we have  
no plans to do so\). Now‚ if we ever do such a test again‚ we will automati-  
cally give customers who purchased a test item the lowest test price for that  
item at the conclusion of the test period—thereby ensuring that all customers

2000.  
11Ibid. 616 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
pay the lowest available price. Under this new policy‚ by September 14‚ we  
had refunded to 6‚896 customers an average of \$3.10 as a result of the DVD  
random-price test.  
This incident raises an interesting question\: How can airlines get away  
with charging different prices to different customers while Amazon.com  
had such trouble doing‚ at least on the surface‚ the same thing? Cer-  
tainly‚ the range of prices that airlines typically charge is much more  
than the range Amazon.com charged for its DVDs. \(The highest ticket  
price can be ten times more than the lowest price on some flights.\)  
There are several explanations. For one‚ airline prices come with  
restrictions‚ so the products are in fact differentiated by sale condi-  
tions \(even though the physical product is the same\). Also‚ unlike in  
Amazon.com’s case‚ customers self-select what airline fare they want to  
pay \(second-degree price discrimination\)‚ whereas Amazon offered dis-  
counts to selected customers only \(third-degree price discrimination\).  
And while airline fares change over time as allocations close down‚ at  
any given point in time‚ everyone is given the same choices‚ and no one is  
treated differently. Airlines‚ moreover‚ do not control sales by changing  
fares directly; they change the allocation of capacity to each fare. So  
rather than prices rising‚ discounts “sell out‚” which seemingly creates  
a more acceptable perception among customers. Airline customers have  
also grown accustomed to frequent price changes based on many years of  
experience. In contrast‚ dynamic pricing in retail is a more recent prac-  
tice‚ so it may take time before customers accept it. Finally‚ dynamic  
pricing is often perceived of as an irritating practice for low-priced items  
because the search cost for customers is high relative to the value of the  
item. In contrast‚ for expensive items like airline tickets or automobiles‚  
customers are more willing to spend time and effort to shop around for  
a bargain. Jeff Bezos‚ the CEO of Amazon.com‚ acknowledged as such  
in a subsequent press statement.12  
This list of differences should give a clue to what customers may or  
may not find acceptable about RM. If customers perceive that there is  
a tangible reason for price differences‚ they tend to be more accepting.  
Examples include early bird or advance-purchase discounts‚ volume dis-  
counts‚ a price that is related to dwindling or excess capacity \(clearance  
sales\)‚ or prices related to the distress of the firm \(going out of business  
sales\). In short‚ if customers can “rationalize” the price differences they  
see‚ they are more accepting.  
12Reuters news report‚ September 27‚ 2000. *Implementation* 617  
Also‚ customers perceive RM as more fair if they can self-select options  
and all customer receive the same options at each point in time. We have  
already discussed this in the context of airline fares. As another example‚  
consider auction mechanisms. They neither guarantee a uniform price  
to all customers nor offer stable prices over time. Yet most people regard  
auctions as “fair‚ ” in the sense that the mechanism is transparent and  
customers win based purely on what they are willing to bid. Since each  
customer wins or loses based on his or her own self-determined bid‚ it is  
hard to argue that one is ever “cheated” out of winning as a result. If‚  
however‚ the firm were to \(hypothetically\) perform the same allocation—  
that is‚ set prices and allocate units by customer valuation—then it is  
likely that customers would indeed question the fairness of the process.  
Customers also appear more willing to tolerate differential prices if  
the product is expensive. In fact‚ for low-price products one can think  
of stable “fair” pricing as producing a beneficial equilibrium between  
customers and the firm‚ in which customers adopt a strategy of not  
searching for lower prices \(thereby avoiding search costs\) and in turn  
the firm adopts a strategy of not taking short-run advantage of loyal  
customers \(thereby inducing loyal customers not to shop around\). This  
perhaps explains the sense of “betrayal” among loyal Amazon.com cus-  
tomers to the price experiments. When the price of the product is high  
relative to search costs‚ however‚ this equilibrium is harder to sustain  
because customers have a much stronger incentive to comparison shop.  
Both parties seem to tolerate \(or at least understand\) “disloyal” behavior  
as a result.  
When a firm raises prices because supply is low‚ it could easily be  
viewed as price gouging‚ especially for essential items. However‚ a firm  
can usually avoid this stigma if there are viable alternatives to the prod-  
uct and customers are made aware of these alternatives. So‚ for example‚  
if demand is high for a particular resort hotel on a particular day‚ cus-  
tomers should be informed of other dates with lower prices. In this way‚  
the *customer* makes the tradeoff between a higher price and convenience.  
A sense of fairness can also be explained in terms of psychological and  
social factors. One theory from economics and marketing holds \(see Ap-  
pendix E\) that customers form a reference price about an item based on  
past purchases‚ market prices and prices of comparable products. The  
principle of *dual entitlement‚* another theory from economics and mar-  
keting \[522‚ 275\]‚ says that customers believe that they are entitled to  
a reasonable price \(say‚ the reference price\) and firms in turn are enti-  
tled to a reasonable profit. Customers’ views of fairness‚ so the theory  
goes‚ arise from these principles. Therefore‚ customers may perceive  
high prices during periods of high demand as “unfair” even though the 618 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
economic law of supply and demand would justify such pricing \[275‚ 276‚  
98‚ 296\].  
**11.5.2 Managing Perceptions**  
The perception of unfairness is indeed a problem for RM. It is espe-  
cially so if the customers come in contact \(as in an airplane\) and ex-  
change information on the prices they paid and less of a problem when  
customers are more isolated \(say a hotel\). For example‚ it is reported  
that RM has often caused negative reactions in the cruise-line business  
because customers are confined together on a ship for many days and  
inevitably end up sharing information on the prices they paid.  
This does not mean one should abandon thinking of implementing  
RM. Rather‚ it should suggest a need to identify strategies to manage  
customer perception on unfairness as part of an overall RM implemen-  
tation.  
How‚ then‚ can a firm appeal to the principle of dual entitlement to  
convince customers that it is not price gouging? Some possible strategies  
and tactics include the following.  
Clarify exactly why the firm charges different prices‚ whether limited  
supply‚ peak versus off-peak time‚ or advance-purchase discounts that  
reduce risk—and at the same time on what bases the firm does *not*  
charge different prices \(such as knowledge of the customer\). This en-  
hances the sense of fairness of RM practices. In short‚ it is important  
to emphasize the rationale associated with discounts and not simply  
quote a price.  
Emphasize any differences in the product itself‚ no matter how small  
\(room with a view‚ larger room\). The additional value of these fea-  
tures may not justify the price differences‚ but if customers feel that  
the physical product itself has variations and that these variations  
are the reason the firm is charging different prices‚ they will tend to  
perceive the prices as fairer.  
Stress alternatives that the firm offers at a lower price. So‚ for ex-  
ample‚ if a discount is not available on a particular date‚ offer other  
dates on which the discount is available. This not only encourages  
efficient usage of capacity but also allows customers to decide‚ based  
on their individual valuations‚ which of the alternatives they want to  
buy.  
Emphasize self-selection wherever possible. Present a full menu of  
prices and products so that customers can choose for themselves. *Implementation* 619  
To the extent possible‚ discourage price disclosure among customers.  
For example‚ do not display price overtly on tickets and other paper-  
work‚ and keep sale interactions as private as possible.  
**11.5.3 Overbooking Perceptions**  
One area of RM where customer expectations have to be managed  
especially carefully is overbooking. Customers who make a reservation  
and pay for it expect to receive the product. At the same time‚ customers  
who reserve and cancel expect a full refund‚ since from their point of view  
they have not used the product. Overbooking‚ as discussed in Chapter 4‚  
is the fine art of balancing these customer expectations while maximizing  
utilization of capacity.  
Managing overbooking is certainly not limited to just the science and  
models. No matter how well the models perform‚ there will inevitably  
be a day when a customer with a guaranteed reservation cannot be  
accommodated. So policies and procedures need to be put in place to  
handle these inevitable denied-service situations.  
Customer acceptance of overbooking depends to a large part on tradi-  
tion and industry norms. In the airline industry in the United States for  
instance‚ it is pretty much accepted as part and parcel of airline travel.  
This can be attributed to a number of reasons. First‚ the voluntary  
denied-boarding system discussed in Section 4.1.1‚ whereby volunteers  
are requested to take an alternative flight in return for compensation‚ is  
widely perceived as a fair means of selecting who will be denied service.  
Second‚ airline travelers usually have a number of alternatives flights.  
Third‚ the process is transparent; all passengers are gathered together  
at one spot at the time of departure‚ so everyone realizes that the flight  
is oversold and that someone has to be left behind. \(This cannot be said  
for a hotel‚ for instance‚ as an arriving customer sees no queue or clear  
evidence of a full hotel.\) Finally‚ there is a long history and tradition  
of overbooking in the airline industry‚ and airline ticketing staff are well  
trained to handle denied boardings.  
Planning‚ training of customer-relations staff‚ and well-established  
policies and procedures are the key factors in managing overbooking.  
Firms usually have advance notice that an overbooking situation is go-  
ing to arise. By adequately making plans in advance‚ customers can  
often be accommodated with substitute arrangements.  
If customers have to be denied service involuntarily‚ the procedures  
should be fair and minimize inconvenience to the customer as much  
as possible. Compensation should be flexible and geared toward the  
interests of the customer. If the customer expects cash \(in lieu of‚ say‚ a  
50% discount for the next stay at the hotel\)‚ the firm should specify how 620 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
much cash can be offered. Customer-service staff also needs to be trained  
to manage customer expectations about the level of compensation.  
It should be pointed out that in the airline industry‚ despite the highly  
refined practices and many years of experience‚ overbooking still ranks  
among the most prominent customer-service problems. Thus‚ the prac-  
tice is something of an awkward compromise between service quality and  
efficiency.  
**11.6 Cultural‚ Organizational‚ and Training**  
# Issues  
With all the sophisticated models and mathematical techniques em-  
ployed in RM‚ it is easy lose sight of the human and organizational chal-  
lenges involved in implementing and maintaining a RM system. The  
huge investments in technology also tend to overshadow important or-  
ganizational issues. Yet poor organizational planning is often the reason  
cited for the failure of a RM implementation‚ and poor training is fre-  
quently blamed for subsequent inadequate performance. In this section‚  
we look at the main RM organizational and training issues.  
**11.6.1 Changes in Responsibility by Function**  
Organizational and business process changes are usually required at  
the time of the introduction of RM‚ and once the RM system stabi-  
lizes‚ even broader organizational changes may be desirable. As a RM  
system implementation cuts across multiple departments and functional  
areas‚ it requires significant cross-functional coordination. Product de-  
sign‚ capacity planning‚ pricing‚ inventory control‚ operations‚ IT‚ sales  
and marketing‚ and finance departments are all affected to some degree  
or the other by a RM system implementation. Let us first review how  
the main groups are affected.  
**11.6.1.1 Analysts**  
If a firm is managing pricing or inventory manually‚ the analysts who  
make the day-to-day decisions are the most affected by a RM system‚ in  
the sense that it is their work routines and roles that change the most.  
As the technology behind RM is alien to most analysts‚ they are of-  
ten intimidated by the sheer complexity of a RM system and suspicious  
that an automated system could replace their own intuition and expe-  
rience. They also often may feel their jobs are threatened by a move to  
automated decision making.  
Therefore‚ top management ought to emphasize that RM is first and  
foremost a philosophy and a set of business practices and is secondarily a *Implementation* 621  
decision *support* technology. It is important to stress that the technology  
is a tool intended to help them make better decisions not a machine to  
replace them. It is worth emphasizing the vital role of analysts in both  
monitoring the system’s recommendations and intervening when special  
conditions warrant intervention. Analysts should also be educated about  
the basics of the science behind the system’s functionality, to demystify it  
as much as possible. They should understand its inputs, outputs, and the  
underlying assumptions behind the methodology. Emphasizing that they  
will be upgrading their skills and learning “leading-edge” technology also  
helps motivate the transition. Once the analysts understand and buy in  
into the RM concept, they will be more comfortable using the system.  
The quality of analysts’ jobs almost always improves once a RM sys-  
tem is implemented. Their role changes from making routine inventory  
or pricing decisions manually to monitoring the output relative to the  
current business situation. For example, if an unexpected event happens  
that affects demand, they can adjust forecasts manually to compensate;  
if business objectives require more or less aggressive overbooking, they  
can adjust the parameters to get the desired effect. Rarely do analysts  
need to override optimization outputs directly. However, if the business  
need arises, they can open up or close a particular booking class \(for  
quantity-based RM\) or set markdown rates manually across stores \(in  
price-based RM\). Analysts can also use the system to perform “what if  
analysis, eliminating a large part of the guesswork involved in making  
decisions. Or they can let the system come up with the optimal decisions  
automatically based on revised inputs. In short, whereas the former role  
of analysts could be described as allocation or price setters, their new  
role becomes one of model calibrators, data analysts, problem solvers,  
system performance monitors, and business controllers.  
**11.6.1.2 Sales Teams**  
Sales teams are frequently effected by a RM implementation, espe-  
cially if their compensation is based on sales volume. Volume of sales is  
not the primary objective for RM, of course; increased revenue is. And  
meeting this revenue objective may mean lower unit sales. More impor-  
tant, while the salesforce might have had the right to sell at their own  
discretion, once a RM system is in place they may be prevented from  
offering discounts. Sales representatives may view this as undermining  
their relationship with customers and limiting their ability to meet sales  
goals.  
The expectations of the salesforce therefore also have to be managed.  
As with analysts, the salesforce has to be educated about the basic prin-  
ciples of RM. They should be trained to sell products using the forecasts 622 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
and system allocations as guidelines. So instead of seeing closed alloca-  
tion or discounts as a lost opportunity for selling, they should be encour-  
aged to shift demand to products or period where discounts are open  
or persuade customers to upgrade. Their role should also include gath-  
ering market intelligence on private deals that competitors are offering,  
so products and discounts to match the competition can be introduced.  
Indeed, sales has always performed a market intelligence function, it is  
just made more challenging by RM because of the increase in the number  
of products and the complexity of the sale restrictions.  
Finding the right incentive structure for sales teams in a RM frame-  
work is also an important challenge. Ideally, one would like to set incen-  
tives for the salesforce to generate profitable sales, while still maintaining  
the correct valuation for new incremental business. A few approaches  
have been tried using non-volume-based measures. For example, in air-  
line RM group sales, the salesforce may be rewarded based on the revenue  
they generate *in excess* of the estimated bid prices \(opportunity costs\)  
for the capacity they sell. Such incentives have the potential to better  
align the saleforce’s efforts with the objectives of the new RM system.  
**11.6.1.3 IT Department**  
Because of the massive technological development involved in RM,  
IT departments are frequently placed in charge of implementation. A  
RM system, however, is not like many other IT systems, in the sense  
that it is based on scientific models that are highly data-fragile. The  
system can be easily corrupted by data that is out of date, insufficient,  
or not cleaned properly, even while it keeps giving out reasonable-looking  
numbers.  
RM systems also need data collected at the lowest possible level, and  
they need data stored for a relatively long time in operational databases.  
Storage costs have come down so much that it is no longer that expensive  
or difficult to store detailed customer data over many periods. Rather,  
the issue is more about developing the systems and procedures so that  
data is automatically stored, retrieved, and analyzed quickly. If the firm  
is not collecting the data suitable for RM, then the IT department must  
start working on such data collection far ahead of a RM implementation,  
so that the models have enough historical data to build on. Indeed, the  
IT department may need to start collecting data even prior to choos-  
ing a vendor or defining the need for a RM system, which may create  
budgetary and staffing conflicts that require high-level intervention to  
resolve. Also, there is the potential for something of a chicken-and-egg  
dilemma in this regard, as a RM system won’t perform well without data,  
and the data is not worth gathering if the system is not performing well. *Implementation* 623  
**11.6.1.4 Other Functions**  
Other functional areas of the organization will be affected by a RM  
implementation as well. Pricing analysts and product-design groups  
have to input their knowledge on customer preferences and behavior so  
appropriate RM products can be created. Business rules and existing  
business contracts have to be respected and the RM system needs to  
conform to these rules.  
Operations and customer-service divisions are affected by overbooking  
decisions made by a RM system. If the firm never practiced overbooking  
in the past, or did it in an ad-hoc way, then customer-service represen-  
tatives and field managers have to be involved in the implementation  
and develop proper customer-service procedures to handle oversale sit-  
uations.  
**11.6.2 Project and Organizational Structure**  
Given the interdepartment coordination and rapid communication  
that is required, any RM implementation should involve careful review  
and planning for the new organizational design, both at the project stage  
and at the operational stage.  
**11.6.2.1 Project Organization**  
The project leadership role could be taken by the operations research  
group—or lacking one, by the pricing or inventory-control group. How-  
ever, IT and sales organizations have to be involved even from the  
project-conception stage. All this will be feasible, of course, only if  
senior management buys in and backs the project wholeheartedly. A se-  
nior officer has to be actively involved in the implementation to smooth  
over interdepartmental frictions and priorities. Indeed, most industry  
experiences of RM cite top-management leadership as a key success fac-  
tor. It is also important to have all teams involved every step of the  
way—from initial proposal, to implementation, to training, to perfor-  
mance measurement. Table 11.12 shows a task list for a typical RM  
implementation.  
**11.6.2.2 Operational Organization**  
It is also important to think through the organizational design that  
will support RM on an ongoing basis. One important issue is how an-  
alysts are organized \(by product, market, or resource\). For example,  
in airline single-resource quantity-based RM, analysts are normally as-  
signed collections of flights to manage. The flights may be related by  
geographical market \(flights into or out of the same city\) or by “type” 624 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
\(leisure versus business markets\). In retail RM, analysts \(buyers\) are  
typically organized by product category \(women’s casual sportswear\),  
though they are occasionally organized by geographic region. Hotels are  
usually managed on an individual property basis, while car-rental ana- *Implementation* 625  
lysts are most often organized on a regional basis. Figure 11.11 shows  
some typical organizational charts in RM industries.  
Each such organizational design involves a tradeoff; reducing the com-  
plexity of the decision-making task by decomposing the problem versus  
maintaining synergy and coordination among decisions by expanding  
the domain of control. There is no perfect solution to this problem, and  
different firms have had success with different organizational designs. 626 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
A second organizational issue is how to manage the various levels of  
decision making. For example, traditionally most airlines had separate  
marketing, pricing, and inventory-control groups. The marketing group  
was responsible for high-level decisions about branding, fare structure,  
and promotions; the pricing group was responsible for monitoring and re-  
acting to fare changes in each O-D market; finally, the inventory-control  
group was responsible for day-to-day overbooking and capacity-control  
decisions on each flight. Today, however, many airlines are integrating  
all three functions into a single group, as the three sets of decisions are  
interrelated. Again, the main tradeoff here is between a desire for coor-  
dination versus a need to keep the analysts’ job focused and manageable.  
A final issue concerns which functional area has overall responsibility  
for RM. It is common to have both inventory control and pricing as mar-  
keting responsibility, although there are many firms where the finance  
department or even operations department is responsible for both, and  
some where pricing and inventory control are organized in a separate  
department reporting directly to the CEO.  
**11.6.2.3 Organizing for Network RM**  
Organizing for network RM presents special challenges. For one, if  
the current organization has analysts responsible for a limited number  
of markets, then as a network RM system makes decisions that cut across  
market boundaries, reorganizing analysts’ responsibilities is almost al-  
ways necessary to avoid conflicts. For example, if analysts make changes  
to a forecast, should they be allowed to reoptimize the network? What if  
multiple users are making changes at the same time? Such concurrency  
and locking issues frequently come up in a network RM system.  
A network RM organizational structure normally has some analysts  
work at the market level and some at the network level, responsible  
for resolving any conflicts that arise across the different markets and  
for coordinating and batching forecast and parameter changes, Such  
network coordinators can also liaison with groups desks and network  
\(product\) designers.  
If the RM system is implemented across multiple resources \(a retail  
chain using price-based RM across multiple stores, a hotel chain imple-  
menting a RM system across all its properties, or a freight company  
managing inventory over many branch offices\), then the question of cen-  
tralized versus decentralized control arises. That is, should the system  
reside at head office and forecast and optimize across all the dispersed  
resources, or should each unit have its own decentralized RM system?  
The argument for decentralization is that local field managers are in  
closer touch with their markets, so they are perhaps in a better position *Implementation* 627  
to manage the system’s decisions. On the other hand, from a system’s  
point of view, it is a lot easier to manage a centralized system. More-  
over, a central system enables a firm to dedicate a set of skilled and  
experienced RM professionals focused solely on managing, developing,  
and maintaining the system. If the firm is using multiresource optimiza-  
tion, then RM by necessity has to be performed centrally as information  
has to be aggregated in real time. \(For example, the hierarchical Bayes  
models of Section 9.3.6 requires information from multiple resources.\)  
With the increasing use of Web-enabled applications and interfaces, a  
compromise solution is to do the processing at a central office for all the  
units but let unit managers control the results, prices, or allocations, via  
a Web-enabled interface.  
**11.6.2.4 Operational Responsibility**  
Once the system is in operation, a different set of organizational issues  
comes up. To begin with, who should have operational responsibility of  
the system? Again, some interdepartmental coordination is unavoidable.  
While certainly the inventory control or pricing department “owns” the  
system as they are the daily users, they need the IT department to  
support the system, the operations research department to support the  
models and the science, and the pricing, sales, and marketing depart-  
ments to coordinate prices, deals and promotions.  
As mentioned, many firms with ongoing RM practices are finding that  
it is best to merge pricing and inventory-control departments. Pricing  
and RM are so strongly linked that unless one unit is responsible for  
both, no real coordination can be achieved. For instance, if prices are  
changed, forecasting based on historical data \(as is done currently\) can  
be unreliable. Analyst intervention is then required to manually adjust  
the forecasts. However, the processes for such close communication get  
complicated if the responsibility resides in different departments. An-  
other reason for having pricing and inventory control under the same  
roof in the airline industry is the emergence of pricing decision support  
systems that complement RM systems.  
**11.6.3 Training**  
As regards training employees for RM, the abiding sentiment in indus-  
try is that there can never can be enough it. Most vendors offer on-site  
training programs. In addition, many consulting firms and professional  
schools have customized education and training programs by industry.  
Training classes, both before and after implementation, should be  
conducted at various levels of management. For midlevel managers, the  
main emphasis should be on the principles of RM. For supervisors, more 628 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
training is needed on the details of the technology \(at least at a concep-  
tual level\) and how the system “thinks” in terms of coming up with its  
recommendations. Analysts and line managers need this same training,  
but they also need specific training in how to use the software effectively  
and when and when not to override the system recommendations.  
Training should also be extended to groups that are not direct users of  
the system but are affected by it. This includes sales, customer service,  
pricing, and groups desks.

The material on organizational issues has been gathered from many  
industry presentations and conversations with industry RM practition-  
ers.  
# APPENDIX 11.A\: Normal and Inverse Normal Ap-  
# proximations  
Most spreadsheet programs and mathematical libraries have functions for the nor-  
mal distribution and its inverse. The formulas in this appendix are useful for any-  
one programming a RM system \(say, an EMSR algorithm\). There are a number of  
such approximations circulating as folklore in the scientific programming community.  
The normal approximation we present is due from Abramowitz and Stegun \[2\] and  
Bagby \[24\] and is accurate up to four digits. The inverse normal distribution is based  
on Halley’s method \(\[455\]\) and presented here as implemented by Acklam \[3\].  
It is common in quantity-based RM practice to assume that the aggregate number  
of customers follows a normal distribution truncated to the left at zero. As is well-  
known, there are no closed-form expressions for the normal distribution and its inverse.  
In simulations \(as well as in RM optimization algorithms such as the EMSRb\) rational  
approximation functions to the normal distribution are used, which we describe next.  
Both are highly accurate and sufficient for most practical applications in RM.  
The following approximation is accurate up to four digits.

A *probability space* is defined by a triple where is a given set of

an *event*\), and *P*\(·\) is a *probability measure* that assigns a nonnegative number *P*\(*B*\)  
to each subset *B* in

A *random variable* is a function mapping elementary outcomes to real numbers,  
and is denoted —or simply *X,* where the dependence on is  
implicit. The *cumulative distribution function* \(c.d.f.\) of a random variable *X*—or  
just *distribution function* for short—is defined by  
If *X* takes on only countable values, we define the *probability-mass function* \(pmf\) by  
the function  
Such a random variable is said to be *discrete.* If *F* is differentiate, then the *probability-*  
*density function* is defined by  
Such a random variable is said to be *continuous.*  
Let denote a vector of random variables and a  
real vector. Then we define the *joint distribution* of *X* by 636 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*

# Expectations and Moment-Generating Functions  
The *expected value*—or *mean*—of a random variable *X* is defined by the integral  
where the right-hand side above is equal to when *X* is discrete. For a general function pected value of is defined by  
if *X* is continuous and

The moment-generating function is also useful for analyzing sums of random vari-  
ables. Indeed, if *X* and *Y* are two independent random variables with moment-  
generating functions and respectively, and *Z = X + Y,* then  
That is, the moment-generating function of a sum of independent random variables  
is simply the product of their individual moment-generating functions. *APPENDIX B\: Probability* 637  
# Inequalities  
*Jensen’s inequality* states that if is a convex function, then  
This is often useful in obtaining bounds on stochastic optimization problems.  
Another useful bound in RM problems is due to Gallege \[200\] and involves a bound  
on the function \(the positive part of *X —* It states  
that for any random variable *X* with mean and finite variance  
For example, if *X* is demand and is a capacity level, then is the rejected  
demand \(spilled demand\) and the above bound provides an upper bound on the  
expected spilled demand  
# Some Useful Distributions  
We next provide the basic definitions of the most commonly used distributions in  
RM problems.  
# Discrete Distributions  
# Bernoulli  
A random variable *X* has a Bernoulli distribution if it takes on only two values, 0 and  
1\. A Bernoulli distribution is characterized by a single parameter \(the probability  
that *X =* 1\) with In RM, it is often used as the model of a single  
cancellation.  
The basic definitions and properties are  
# Binomial  
A random variable *X* has a binomial distribution if it is the sum of Bernoulli random variables. For example, the number of cancellations in a group  
of reservations when each independently cancels with probability distribution is characterized by the two parameters and with independent  
A binomial  
and  
The basic definitions and properties are 638 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
# Poisson  
In RM, the Poisson distribution is used as a model of demand or as a \(continuous  
parameter\) approximation to the Binomial distribution. It is characterized by a single  
nonnegative parameter \(its mean\).  
The basic definitions and properties are  
# Continuous Distributions  
# Uniform  
A uniform distribution is defined by two constants and represents a case where  
the random variable is equally likely to assume any value in the interval  
The basic definitions and properties are  
# Exponential  
The exponential distribution is defined by a single parameter  
The basic definitions and properties are *APPENDIX B\: Probability* 639  
# Normal  
The normal \(or Gaussian\) distribution is frequently used as a model of demand. It is  
characterized by two parameters, its mean and its variance  
The basic definitions and properties are  
The normal has the property that if *X* and *Y* are two independent normal random  
variables, then the sum *X + Y* also has a normal distribution \(it is “closed under ad-  
dition”\). For example, if *X* and *Y* are independent with means and variances  
\(respectively\), then their sum *X + Y* has a normal distribution with mean  
and variance  
# Gumbel  
The Gumbel \(or double-exponential\) distribution is frequently used in discrete-choice  
models because it is “closed under maximization.” That is, the maximum of two  
Gumbel random variables is also a Gumbel random variable. It is characterized by  
two parameters, a scale parameter and location parameter

monotonicity and convexity identify classes of random variables for which such  
statements can be made. A good source for this material is the series of papers by  
Shaked and Shantikumar \[460, 461\] and their subsequent book \[462\].  
DEFINITION B.1 *The random function is* **stochastically increasing** *in*  
*if for all*  
A random function is *stochastically decreasing* in if — is stochastically  
increasing. An equivalent definition is provided by the following proposition\:  
PROPOSITION B.1 *is stochastically increasing in if for any*  
*there exists two random variables and defined on a common probability space*  
*such that and are equal in distribution to and \(respec-*  
*tively\), and they satisfy for all*  
Continuing our example, we see that if where are i.i.d.  
Bernoulli random variables, then is stochastically increasing, since we can con-  
sider to define an infinite sequence and consider to be the sum of  
the first variables in this sequence. For every the sums and  
will have the required distribution and for every such sequence

ity\:

To verify whether the above holds is often difficult. However, two stronger notions  
of stochastic convexity are quite useful and both imply stochastic convexity. These

For example, suppose where *Z* is a standard normal random  
variable. Then is normal with mean and standard deviation and is  
strongly stochastically convex in  
A somewhat weaker version of stochastic convexity is the following\:

To illustrate, we show that the sum of Bernoulli random variables is stochastically  
convex \(and concave\) in this sample path sense. To do so, let be  
integers satisfying and and let define an  
infinite sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables as before. Note that

Here we review the basic theory of optimization problems and associated defini-  
tions.  
# Convex Functions and Sets  
Convexity is central to the theory of optimization. We begin with a definition of  
a convex function\:  
DEFINITION C.5 *A function is* **convex** *on a set if, for all*  
If the inequality above is strict for all function is said to be *concave* if convex.  
Convexity can also be defined for sets\:  
DEFINITION C.6 *A set* then is said to be *strictly convex.* A  
is convex and *strictly concave* if is strictly  
*is a* **convex set** *if, for all and*  
A point of the form is referred to as a *convex combination* of the points **x**  
and **y**. A convex set, therefore, is one with the property that any convex combination  
of points in the set is also contained in the set. We also have

# Derivatives and Subderivatives  
Let denote the unit vector \(the vector with all components zero except  
for the component, which is one\). Then the *partial derivative* of a function  
is defined by  
provided the limit exists \(where here denotes tending to zero from above or  
below\). If all partial derivatives exist, the *gradient* is defined as the \(column\) vector  
If each of the partial derivatives of we define the *second partial derivatives* by  
at **x** is itself a differentiable function of then  
The denoted  
matrix of second partial derivatives is called the *Hessian* of at and is  
Consider a vector direction The *directional derivative* is defined by  
provide the limit exists. The function exists and  
is said to be *differentiable* at **x** if and only if  
A function is said to be *continuously differentiable* on a set *X* if the gradient  
exists for all and is continuous on *X.* The class of all continuously differentiable  
functions on is denoted denotes the class of all functions with continuous  
second partial derivatives on  
For a convex function the gradient exists almost everywhere \(at all but a count-  
able number of points in *X*\). If is convex but the gradient does not exist everywhere,  
it is useful to define a generalization of the gradient called a *subgradient* of *APPENDIX C\: Convexity and Optimization* 645  
DEFINITION C. 8 *Let be a convex function defined on A* **subgra-**  
dient *of at point* **x** *is a vector satisfying*  
The *subdifferential* of a of reversed.  
at **x**, denoted is defined as the set of all subgradients  
at **x**. The definition for concave functions simply has the above inequality  
# Optimization Problems  
Let denote a vector of *decision variables,* be a given *objective*  
*function* and be a *constraint set.* A point **x** in the set *X* is called *feasible,* and  
points not in *X* are called *infeasible.* In a *maximization problem,* we seek a feasible  
solution —called a *global maximum* \(or *global optimum*\)—such that  
Equivalently, solves  
We say such an is *globally optimal.* If *X* is the empty set, then the above optimiza-  
tion problem is said to be *infeasible;* otherwise, the problem *is feasible.* If  
the problem is said to be *unconstrained.* The problem is called *unbounded* if there  
exists a sequence of feasible points with for all and  
A minimization problem reverses the inequality above and is equivalent to maxi-  
mizin – We focus here on only the maximization version. If is concave and  
*X* is convex, then the problem \(C.3\) is called a *convex optimization problem.*  
Let denote the ball of radius about the point **x**. A  
solution is called a *local maximum* \(or *local optimum*\) if there exists an such  
that  
We say such an is *locally optimal.* Note all global optima are also locally optimal.  
In the convex case, local and global optima coincide\:  
PROPOSITION C.5 *If is a concave function defined on a convex set X, then*  
*any local maximum is a global maximum. If is strictly concave, then if a global*  
*maximum exists, it is unique.*  
# Optimality Conditions  
Optimality conditions help identify and characterize optimal solutions. They are  
useful both theoretically and computationally.  
Suppose Then we have the following *first-order necessary conditions* for  
to be an optimal solution\:  
PROPOSITION C.6 *If and is a local maximum, then there exists an*  
*such that*  
In particular, if \(the unconstrained case\), then this condition reduces to 646 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
If is concave, then these conditions are also sufficient\:  
PROPOSITION C.7 *Suppose Then if a point satisfies*  
*is a concave function and X is a convex set.*  
*it is a global maximum.*  
In the nonconvex unconstrained case, local optimality is guaranteed by the follow-  
ing *second-order sufficiency conditions*\:  
PROPOSITION C.8 *If and then if a point satisfies*  
*\(i\)*  
*\(ii\) is positive definite,*  
*it is a local maximum.*  
There are no general sufficient conditions for global optima in the nonconvex case.  
# Equality and Inequality Constraints  
Suppose the set *X* is defined by a set of linear equalities. That is,  
where \(i.e., so the optimization problem  
to solve is  
We require the following definition\:  
DEFINITION C.9 *A point satisfying the constraints* **h**\(**x**\) = **b** *if the vectors is said to be a* **regular point** *of*  
*are linearly independent.*  
The assumption of regularity of is an example of what is called a *constraint qual-*  
*ification,* a condition that ensures that the first-order conditions correctly identify a  
local optimum.  
We then have the following first-order necessary conditions\:  
PROPOSITION C.9 *Suppose and is a local maximum of the function*  
*over the constraint set Then if is a regular point, there exist*  
*a vector such that*  
A vector above is called a *Lagrange multiplier* of the constraints **h**\(**x**\) = **b**.  
If the constraint set is defined by inequalities, so the problem is  
where point in this case is\:  
then similar conditions apply. Indeed, the definition of a regular *APPENDIX C\: Convexity and Optimization* 647  
DEFINITION C.10 *A point satisfying of the constraints if the vectors in the set linearly independent,*  
*is said to be a* **regular point**  
*are*  
This leads to the following first-order necessary conditions \(called the *Kuhn-Tucker*  
*conditions*\)\:  
PROPOSITION C.10 *Suppose and is a local maximum of the function*  
*over the constraint set Then if is a regular point, there*  
*exist a vector with such that*  
In the convex case, both Propositions C.9 and C.10 provide sufficient conditions  
for optimality. That is, if is concave, the set *X* defined by the equality or inequality  
constraints is convex, and we find a feasible solution and an associated multiplier  
satisfy the conditions of Propositions C.9 \(or Proposition C.10 in the inequality  
case\), then is a global maximum.  
# Sensitivity Analysis  
The Lagrange multipliers have an interpretation as giving the rate of change of  
the objective function as a function of the right-hand side vectors. Indeed, let  
Then under some relatively mild regularity conditions \(see Bertsekas \[59\]\), one can  
show  
where solution Similarly, if  
is the Lagrange multiplier associated with an equality-constrained optimal  
then  
where solution is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the corresponding optimal  
The multipliers therefore measure the effect that small changes in the  
right-hand-sides have on the optimal objective function value.  
# Parametric Monotonicity  
Paramteric monotonicity addresses the question of how optimal solutions vary as a  
function of the parameters of an optimization problem. These parametric monotonic-  
ity results are used, for example, in the analysis of the base-stock, list price policies of 648 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Section 5.3.2, which show that the optimal list price in an inventory-pricing problem  
\(the optimal solution\) is decreasing in the inventory on hand \(the parameter\).  
More abstractly, let be a constraint set, be a set of parameter  
values and be an objective function. We need the following definition\:  
DEFINITION C. 11 *A function in if for all and*  
*is said to have increasing differences*  
Define the component-wise minimum \(the *meet*\) of two vectors **x** and **y** in by  
and the component-wise maximum \(the join\) of the vectors by  
A set is called a *lattice* if for all **x**,**y** in *X,* the meet and joint of **x** and **y**  
are also in *X.* If in addition *X* is compact \(closed and bounded\), then the set *X* is  
called a *compact sublattice.* A point is said to be a *greatest element* \(respectively,  
*least element*\) of the sublattice *X* if \(respectively, for all We  
then have  
PROPOSITION C.11 *and least element.*  
*If X is a nonempty, compact sublattice, then X has a greatest*  
That is, if *X* is a compact sublattice, we can always identify a “largest” and “smallest”  
\(component-wise\) element of the set *X.*  
Consider next the following definition\:  
DEFINITION C.12 *A function all* **z** *and in*  
*is said to be supermodular in* **z** *if for*  
If above is a derivatives satisfy  
function, then it is supermodular if and only if the cross-partial  
So for derivatives.  
functions, supermodularity corresponds to nonnegativity of the cross-partial  
Now consider the following optimization problem, for fixed  
and define the *optimal action correspondence* \(such as a set of optimal solutions\)  
We want to determine when these optimal solutions are in some sense “increasing”  
in *APPENDIX C\: Convexity and Optimization* 649  
The following theorem \(see Sundaram \[495\] and Topkis \[516\] for proofs\) shows that  
the property of decreasing differences and supermodularity can be used to establish  
such parametric monotonicity.  
THEOREM C.1 *Suppose that \(i\) the optimization problem \(C.5\) has at least one*  
*optimal solution for each \(ii\) satisfies decreasing differences in and*  
*\(iii\) is supermodular in* x *for each Then for each there exist a greatest*  
*optimal solution This greatest optimal solution is nondecreasing in*  
*the parameters that is, for all*  
This result says that higher values of lead to higher optimal decisions Cor-  
responding definitions of decreasing difference and submodularity are used to show  
when optimal solutions are decreasing in a given parameter.  
# Linear Programs  
An optimization problem is called a *linear program* if the objective function and  
all the equality and inequality constraints are defined by linear functions. That is,  
for some vector and the constraint set is of the form *X* = \{**Ax** =  
**b**\} or \(or combinations of inequality and equality constraints\). Since  
we can always write an equality constraint as two inequality constraints,  
and and and we can always write a variable **x** as where  
- any linear program can be converted into the form  
Many problems can be expressed as linear programs, and there are specialized, highly  
efficient algorithms for solving them; hence, they warrant special attention. We have  
the following proposition, which shows that we can restrict our search for optimal  
solutions to extreme point solutions\:  
PROPOSITION C.12 *If the linear program \(C.6\) has an optimal solution, then it*  
*has an optimal solution that is an extreme point of the set*  
The popular *simplex algorithm* for solving linear programs is based on searching  
the extreme points of the set *X.*  
The linear program \(C.6\) has an associated *dual* linear program \(or dual problem\)  
defined by  
The original problem \(C.6\) is called the *primal* linear program \(or primal problem\).  
The primal and dual problems are related as follows\:  
PROPOSITION C.13 *If either the primal problem \(C.6\) or the dual problem \(C.7\)*  
*has a finite optimal solution, then so does the other, and the optimal objective function*  
*values are equal. Moreover, if the primal is unbounded, then the dual is infeasible,*  
*and if the dual is unbounded, then the primal is infeasible.* 650 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
A linear program is called a *network flow* problem if there is a directed graph  
*G* = \(*N, A*\), where is a set of *nodes* and *A* is a set of directed arcs  
connecting the nodes in *N.* That is, an arc is an ordered pair Define to be  
the flow on arc Then a minimum-cost network-flow problem is a linear program  
of the form  
where are cost coefficients, are upper bounds on the flows \(equal to zero if no  
arc exists\) and are *source/sink* quantities satisfying Network-  
flow problems can be solved even more efficiently than general linear programs using  
specialized algorithms.  
# NonDifferentiable Optimization  
In nondifferentiable-optimization problems, the gradient exist everywhere on the constraint set *X.* For example, uous, piecewise linear function of of the form  
may not always  
may be a scalar contin-  
This function has a corner point at where the derivative does not exist. In such  
cases, we have the following necessary and sufficient condition for optimality in the  
unconstrained, convex case\:  
PROPOSITION C.14 *If* is *concave, and then is a global maximum*  
*if and only if*  
Note that for the example given above, contained in the subdifferential at that if is differentiable at is concave and so zero is  
and hence is a maximum. Also observe  
the above condition reduces to \(C.4\). **Appendix D**  
# Dynamic Programming  
Fundamentally, dynamic programming addresses how to make optimal decisions  
over time. While it can be applied to both deterministic and stochastic problems, our  
focus here is on stochastic problems because making decisions under uncertainty is  
central to revenue management. Our treatment largely follows that in Bertsekas \[57\]  
with some slight variations in notation. We summarize only the key results for the  
discrete-state, discrete-time, finite-horizon problem, again because it is the most fre-  
quently encountered one in RM. The reader is referred to Bertsekas \[57\] for an ex-  
tensive treatment of other cases of dynamic programming and a discussion of further  
theoretical and computational issues.  
# Elements of a Dynamic Program  
Dynamic programming involves the optimal control of a *system* over time. The system  
is dynamic and its *state* evolves over time as a function of both *control decisions* and  
*random disturbances* according to a *system equation.* The system generates *rewards*  
that are a function of both the state and the control decisions. The objective is to  
find a *control policy* that maximizes the total expected rewards from the system.  
There are *T* time-periods. Time is indexed by and the time indices run forward,  
so is the first period and is the last period. The key elements of a dynamic  
program and related technical assumptions are  
The *system state.* Assumed to be discrete and belonging to a finite-state space  
The *control decision.* Assumed discrete and constrained to a finite set,  
that may depend on time and the current state  
The *random disturbance.* Assumed to be a discrete random variable \(or vector\)  
with known distribution, belonging to a countable state space The distur-  
bances are independent.  
A *system function,* which determines the next state as a function  
of the current state the decisions and disturbance according to  
the *system equation\:* 652 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
A real-valued *reward function,* specifying the reward in period  
as a function of the current state the decisions and disturbance  
The reward is assumed to be finite for all The total reward is additive,  
where is a *terminal reward.*  
The objective is to maximize the total expected reward  
by choosing control actions **u**\(1\), **u**\(2\),..., **u**\(*T*\). We will assume that the functions  
and the disturbances are such that this expectation is always finite for any  
feasible sequence of control decisions.1  
These control actions may be functions of the current state of the form  
2 A collection of such functions is called a *policy* and is  
denoted simply by A policy is called *admissible* if for all and  
The class of all admissible policies is denoted For a given initial state  
the expected reward of a policy is  
An optimal policy, denoted is one for which  
The optimal expected reward is denoted simply so  
# The Principle of Optimality  
The *principle of optimality,* due to Bellman \[33\], lies at the heart of dynamic pro-  
gramming. It is a strikingly simple idea; namely, that if a policy is optimal for the  
original problem stated above, then it must be optimal for any subproblem of this  
original problem as well. That is, define the reward-to-go for policy at time by  
1For example, the expectation is always finite if the reward function, state space, and distur-  
bance space are all bounded.  
2Note that we have explicitly assumed here that it is sufficient that the control depend only  
on the current state and the current time and it does not need to depend on any other  
information about the *history* of the process up to time Such controls are called *Markovian*  
*controls.* Since the disturbances are independent over time and the system function only  
depends on the current state, disturbance, and control, one can show that there always exists  
an optimal Markovian policy, so it is sufficient to consider only policies of this form. *APPENDIX D\: Dynamic Programming* 653  
The function gives the expected reward starting in state **x** at time over the  
remainder of the truncated horizon We call this truncated problem the  
The principle of optimality then states the following\:  
THEOREM D.2 *If \(D.1\), then the truncated policy That is,*  
*is an optimal policy for the problem*  
*is optimal for the*  
We omit a formal proof of this fact, but it is easy to see why it holds. Indeed,  
suppose was not optimal for the and another policy,  
yields strictly greater expected reward. If this were true, then the policy  
would produce a strictly greater expected reward than does the policy original problem, which contradicts the optimality of Hence, for the  
for the  
must be optimal  
# The Dynamic Programming Recursion  
The principle of optimality leads naturally to a recursive procedure for finding the  
optimal policy. First, for all and all define the optimal reward-  
to-go, called the *value function,* by  
The value function gives the optimal expected reward from time onward given that  
we are in state **x** at time Note that is the optimal expected reward for the  
original problem with initial state **x**. The principle of optimality leads to the following  
recursive procedure for determining the value function\:  
PROPOSITION D.15 *The value function is the unique solution to the recur-*  
*sion*  
*for all and all with boundary conditions*  
*Moreover, if achieves the maximum in \(D.2\) for all and then*  
*is an optimal policy.*  
We omit a formal proof of this fact, but again the reasoning is quite intuitive—namely,  
since measures the optimal expected reward given state in the  
next time-period, the optimal value of the should be the result  
of maximizing the sum of the current expected reward, and the ex-  
pected reward from the  
This is precisely what \(D.2\) does. The result yields the optimal value  
function and the process is repeated.  
The complexity of this recursion depends on the size of the state space control  
space and number of time-periods *T.* The worst-case complexity is 654 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
since for each time and each state we have to search for the control that  
maximizes the right-hand side of \(D.2\).  
The usual difficulty with dynamic programming in practice is that the state space  
can become quite large, making the recursion above computationally complex.  
For example, in a RM problem with inventory classes, each with capacities in  
the range 0,1,..., *C,* the size of the state space is For even moderate values  
of *C* and this becomes prohibitively large. This “curse of dimensionality” is the  
main drawback to dynamic programming. However, for problems with a moderate  
state space, dynamic programming provides a general procedure for computing and  
analyzing optimal decisions.  
# Systems with Observable Disturbances  
We next consider a variation of this traditional dynamic programming formulation  
that helps simplify many RM models. Specifically, consider a case in which we can  
base our control action **u** on perfect knowledge of the disturbance In other  
words, we allow the control to be a function of both the state **x** and the disturbance  
so that The idea here is that in such systems, we can observe  
the disturbance before making our control decision and therefore base our decision  
on the realized value of  
In this case, the basic dynamic programming recursion becomes  
where of emphasizes that we can select a different control **u** for each value  
However, since we can choose a control based on knowing the above  
recursion can be rewritten as  
The recursion \(D.3\) can in fact be represented in the traditional form by expanding  
the state space. First, reindex the disturbances so that we have a new sequence of  
disturbance terms  
Consider adding the new system-state variable by the system equations  
which along with is updated  
where is the same function as in \(D.3\). The initial state is  
and the traditional dynamic programming recursion is  
for all define  
and all To see this can be converted to the same form as \(D.3\), *APPENDIX D\: Dynamic Programming* 655  
where expectation is with respect to and note that  
Now substituting sides above we obtain  
and taking expectations with respect to on both  
which gives us a recursion exactly of the form \(D.3\).  
Note, however, that by using this transformation we have reduced the original  
dynamic programming recursion from one with a state space to one with only  
a state space of The function has a similar interpretation as for this  
reduced state—namely, it is the optimal expected reward-to-go from time onward  
given we are in the reduced state at time where still uncertain \(recall  
Indeed, one can think of this new recursion as propagating  
the system in two stages\: first, the state **x** is realized but **y** remains uncertain. We  
measure the optimal expected reward at this point, yielding Then the value  
is realized, and we make our optimal decision. This takes us to a new  
state and the process repeats. Finally, note that this reduced-form recursion  
results in an optimization step of the form *E*\[max\{ \}\] rather than the max *E*\[\{ \}\]  
found in traditional dynamic programming formulations.  
Here’s a typical example of how this transformation arises in RM. Suppose a scalar capacity, is the revenue of the request in period and is  
if we  
decide to accept a request and zero otherwise. So the reward function is simply  
Capacity evolves according to the system equation  
and the revenue is driven by a random process  
Formulated in traditional terms, we obtain  
However, with the transformation above, we can rewrite this in observable-disturbance  
form as  
Since most dynamic programs in RM are of this observable-disturbance form, we  
typically use the simpler *E*\[max\{ \}\] rather than the traditional max *E*\[\{ \}\] form.This page intentionally left blank**Appendix E**  
# The Theory of Choice  
In this appendix, we briefly review the theory of consumer choice. It is provided  
both as a background and reference on the core concepts of choice theory.  
The most widely used theories of choice assume customers are *rational* decision  
makers who intelligently alter when, what, and how much to purchase to achieve the  
best possible outcome for themselves. This is a quite plausible assumption. Moreover,  
an important consequence of this rationality assumption is that customer behavior  
can be “predicted” by treating each customer as an agent that optimizes over possible  
choices and outcomes. Optimization theory can then be used to model their behavior.  
Indeed, for these reasons rational-customer models are the basis of most economic  
theory.  
Yet despite the theoretical and intuitive appeal of the rationality assumption, in-  
stances of deviations from rational behavior are observed in experiments and in real  
life. Alternative theories of choice have emerged to explain such behavior. These  
models assume customers are not perfectly rational—that there are limits to how  
cleverly they behave or that they exhibit irrational biases in their choice decisions.  
These so-called *behavioral theories* are surveyed below as well.  
# Choice and Preference Relations  
Given two alternatives, a *choice* corresponds to an expression of preference for one  
alternative over another. Here, “alternatives” may refer to different products, different  
quantities of the same product, bundles of different products or various uncertain  
outcomes \(such as buying a house at the asking price versus waiting and bidding  
in an auction against other buyers\). Similarly, given alternatives, choice can be  
defined in terms of the preferences expressed for all pairwise comparisons between  
the alternatives.  
The mathematical construct that formalizes this notion of choice and preference is  
a *preference relation.* Customers are assumed to have a set of *binary preferences* over  
alternatives in a set *X.* That is, given any two alternatives and in *X,* customers  
can rank them and clearly say they prefer one over the other. This is represented by  
the notation A customer strictly prefers to denoted if he prefers  
to but does not prefer to \(that is, he is not indifferent between the two  
alternatives\). 658 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Consider a complete set of all such pairwise binary preferences between alternatives  
in *X.* The following two properties might be reasonably assumed about “rational”  
preferences\:  
**Asymmetry** If is strictly preferred to then is not strictly preferred to  
**Negative transitivity** If is not strictly preferred to and is not strictly  
preferred to then is not strictly preferred to  
Asymmetry and negative transitivity can be considered as “minimal consistency prop-  
erties” for an expression of preference among a set of alternatives. A binary relation  
on a set *X* is called a *preference relation,* if it is asymmetric and negatively tran-  
sitive. While asymmetry is quite plausible, negative transitivity is not a completely  
innocuous assumption, as illustrated by the following example\:  
**Example E.1** Suppose you are choosing among jobs in three different cities. Sup-  
pose the two factors that matter most to you are income and the climate. The job  
in city has a high salary of \$100,000, and the climate is average. The job in city  
offers a salary of only \$50,000, but the climate is terrific. The job in city offers a  
moderate salary of \$70,000 and the climate is poor. You might not strictly prefer  
to because although offers a great salary, offers a great climate. Likewise, you  
might not strictly prefer to because again, while offers a great climate, offers  
a higher salarv. However, you may very well prefer to since has both a higher  
salary and a better climate than does These preferences would violate negative  
transitivity.  
Despite such shortcomings, the properties of asymmetry and negative transitivity  
form the classical basis for modeling customer preferences. The following are some  
examples of preference relations\:  
**Example E.2** \(LEXICOGRAPHIC MODEL\) This model of preferences, due to Tver-  
sky \[521\], assumes customers rank order various attributes of a product and then  
evaluate them using a lexicographic rule. For example, a tennis racquet comes in  
three models *A, B,* and *C* with the following features\:  
The customer’s decision rule is to rank all attributes from most important to least  
important and then eliminate alternatives which do not possess the most important  
attributes. If more than one alternative remains, the next most important attribute  
is chosen as a criterion for elimination of alternatives, and so on.  
For example, a customer may care most about whether a racquet has a wide  
body, then whether it is graphite, and lastly whether it is black. He would then  
prefer racquets with a wide body to all others without a wide body \(regardless of the  
other attributes\). Among all those with wide bodies, he would then select those that  
have graphite construction; among the remaining, he may select only the ones that  
are black, and so on. So for our three products above, this customer would prefer  
product in the order B, A, C. One can verify that the lexicographic model generates  
a preference relation among the alternatives. *APPENDIX E\: The Theory of Choice* 659  
**Example E.3** \(ADDRESS MODEL\) Address models link attributes to preference with-  
out imposing the restriction that some attributes strictly dominate others as in the  
lexicographic model. Suppose we have alternatives and each alternative has tributes that take on real values. Alternatives can then be represented as at-  
points,  
in which is called *attribute space.* For example, in a travel context  
attributes may include departure time, arrival time, and price.  
Each customer has an ideal point \(“address”\) reflecting his most preferred  
combination of attributes \(such as an ideal departure time, arrival time, and price\).  
A customer is then assumed to prefer the product closest to his ideal point in at-  
tribute space, where distance is defined by a metric on \(such as Euclidean  
distance\). These distances define a preference relation, in which if and only  
if that is, if is “closer” to the ideal point of the customer.  
# Utility Functions  
Preference relations are intimately related to the existence of utility functions. Indeed,  
we have the following theorem \(See Kreps \[313\] for a proof.\)\:  
THEOREM E.3 *If X is a finite set, a binary relation and only if there exists a function is a preference relation if*  
*\(called a **utility function**\), such that*  
Intuitively, this theorem follows because if a consumer has a preference relation,  
then all products can be ranked \(totally ordered\) by his preferences; a utility function  
then simply assigns a numerical value corresponding to this ranking. Intuitively, one  
can think of utility as a measure of “value,” though in a strict sense its numerical  
value need not correspond to any such tangible measure. Theorem E.3 applies to  
continuous sets *X* \(such as travel times or continuous amounts of money\) as well under  
mild regularity conditions, in which case the utility function is then continuous.  
The following examples illustrate the construct of utility\:  
**Example E.4** A utility function corresponding to the lexicographic model of Ex-  
ample E.2 can be constructed as follows\: Suppose there are alternatives with  
attributes each. Let the attributes be ordered so that 1 represents the highest-valued  
attribute and the lowest. Let be binary digits representing  
whether alternative possesses attribute Then a utility satisfying Theorem E.3  
is the binary number,  
Maximizing over these utilities leads to the same customer decisions as the lexico-  
graphic model.  
**Example E.5** Consider the address model of Example E.3. Again, Theorem E.3  
guarantees that an equivalent utility maximization model exits that generates the  
same choices. In this case, it is easy to see that for customer the continuous utilities  
where is an arbitrary constant, produce the same decision rule as the address model. 660 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
# Utility for Money and Consumer Budgets  
It is often convenient to narrow the choice of utilities further and express utility in  
monetary terms. To do so, one can pose the question\: Given the customer’s preference  
for goods \(purchase alternatives\), a vector of market prices for these  
goods, and a level of monetary wealth how would a customer “spend” his wealth?  
To make matters simpler, we assume quantities of each good are continuous  
and our customer has a continuous utility function Let The  
*consumer budget problem* can then be formulated as1  
In other words, customers purchase quantities of each good to maximize their  
total utility subject to the constraint that they can spend at most their total wealth  
The optimal solution gives the customer’s utility for wealth \(or money\) the  
optimal solution, gives the customer’s *demand* for each of the goods.  
Utility for money is increasing in since one can always “not spend” the wealth  
Also, since the utility for money depends on the prices of goods, if prices change, both  
the demand and the utility for money may change. The *marginal utility of money*  
also depends on the customer’s wealth The utility for money is concave  
if is concave,2 in which case the consumer has decreasing marginal utility for  
money. Intuitively, this is because at low levels of wealth only highly essential goods  
are purchased \(food, water, clothing, shelter\)—all of which have very high utility  
to most of us. As wealth rises, each marginal dollar is allocated to somewhat less  
important purchases.  
If the function is continuously differentiable and we let denote the optimal  
Lagrange multiplier on the budget constraint in \(E.1\), then the marginal value of  
money is  
We can use this fact to redefine utilities in monetary terms. Indeed, since our cus-  
tomer’s monetary utility for an additional dollar should be one dollar, we should have  
if utilities are measured in dollars. This change of units can be ac-  
complished by rescaling the customer’s utility functions by to form the  
modified utilities  
1Dynamic versions of this consumer budget problem can also be formulated by allowing  
customers to purchase over multiple periods and invest money at a given interest rate for  
future consumption. Other variations introduce wages and a utility for leisure time and allow  
customers to increase their monetary wealth by varying their time allocated to labor, and so  
on.  
2This follows easily from the convexity of the budget constraint and the fact that \(E.1\) is a  
maximization problem. Concavity of the utility function corresponds to having decreasing  
marginal utility of consumption for goods, which is a natural assumption. *APPENDIX E\: The Theory of Choice* 661  
# Reservation Prices  
A *reservation price* is the monetary amount a consumer is willing to give up to acquire  
an extra marginal unit of some good. Reservation prices are also referred to as the  
customer’s *willingness to pay.* Formally, if denotes the optimal solution to \(E.1\),  
the reservation price, denoted for an additional unit of good is given by  
where is the monetary utility \(E.2\). The first-order conditions of the budget  
problem imply since when utilities are measured in dollars.  
Combining this with \(E.3\) implies that Thus, a customer’s reservation price  
for goods that are *currently consumed* is simply the current market price. The reason  
for this equivalence, intuitively, is that if our customer valued another unit of good  
at strictly more than its market price, then he would be able to increase his utility  
by reducing consumption of other goods and increasing his consumption of good  
Since our customer is assumed to be maximizing utility, this cannot occur.  
On the other hand, for goods that are not being consumed, so the first-  
order conditions to \(E.1\) imply or equivalently In other words,  
by \(E.3\) the customer’s reservation price for the first unit of good is strictly less than  
its current market price. Moreover, the customer would change only his allocation  
and buy good if its price dropped below his reservation price  
This formal analysis of reservation price is arguably less important in practice than  
the informal concept—namely, that the reservation price is the maximum amount a  
customer is willing to pay for an additional unit of good And to entice a customer  
to buy good the price must drop below his reservation price. Still, the analysis  
highlights the important fact that reservation prices are not “absolute” quantities.  
Like utility for money, they depend on customers’ preferences, wealth, their current  
consumption levels, and the prices of other goods the customers may buy; change one  
of these factors, and customers’ reservation price may change.  
# Lotteries and Stochastic Outcomes  
Many choices in life involve uncertain outcomes, such as buying insurance, making  
investments or eating at a new restaurant. How do customers respond to these sorts  
of uncertainties? The theory of choice under uncertainty is a deep and extensive topic.  
Here, we outline the basic ideas and highlight the main concepts.  
Consider again a discrete, finite set of alternatives, . Let  
be the class of all probability distributions defined on *X.* That is, is a  
function satisfying and for One can think of  
each *P* as a “lottery,” the outcome of which is that the customer is left with one of  
the alternatives according to the distribution *P.*  
What can we say about the customer’s preference for these various lotteries?  
Specifically, when can we say that for any two lotteries and customers “prefer”  
one over the other \(denoted by  
To answer this question we again need to make some assumptions on customer  
preferences. First, we will assume there exists a preference relation on the  
different outcomes as before. Second, for any two lotteries and consider a  
compound lottery parameterized by as follows\: 662 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
**STEP 1\:** A coin is flipped with probability of heads equal to  
**STEP 2\:** If the coin comes up heads, the customer enters lottery customer enters lottery  
otherwise, the  
Denote this compound lottery by Note this compound lottery  
is also contained in the set \(i.e., is a convex set\). We then require the following  
consistency properties on a customers preference for lotteries\:  
**Substitution axiom** For all and in and all if  
then  
**Continuity axiom** For all and in with there exist  
values and such that  
Roughly, the first axiom says that if one gamble produces strictly preferred out-  
comes for any realization of uncertainty, then the customer should strictly prefer it.  
The second axiom says that if a customer strictly prefers one gamble to another, then  
he should be willing to accept a sufficiently small risk of an even worse outcome to  
take the preferred gamble. Both are reasonable assumptions.  
Under these two axioms, there exist utilities on outcomes such that the expected  
utility of each lottery defines a customer’s preference relation among lotteries. Specif-  
ically,  
THEOREM E.4 *A preference relation on the lotteries exists that satisfies the*  
*substitution and continuity axioms if and only if there exists a utility function*  
*such that if and only if*  
*That is, if and only if the expected utility from lottery exceeds the expected utility*  
*of lottery In addition, any two utility functions and satisfying the above must*  
*be affine transformations of each other; that is,*  
*for some real and*  
This result is due to von Neumann and Morgenstern \[541\] and is known as the *von*  
*Neumann-Morgenstern expected-utility theory.* Essentially, it allows us to extend util-  
ity as a model of customer preference to the case of uncertain outcomes, with expected  
utility replacing deterministic utility as the criterion for customer decision making.  
Since the original deterministic outcomes \(e.g., outcome occurs with probability  
are included in the von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utilities also  
help us “narrow down” the list of possible utility functions for the customer.  
# Risk Preferences  
An important special case of expected-utility theory is when outcomes represent dif-  
ferent monetary amounts, so alternatives correspond to different levels of wealth and  
lotteries correspond to different gambles on a customer’s ending wealth level. For *APPENDIX E\: The Theory of Choice* 663  
this discussion, we assume the wealth levels are continuous and that the customer has  
preferences for wealth that satisfy the conditions of Theorem E.4. Also, assume the  
lotteries are now continuous distributions *F* on 3  
Consider now any given lottery *F* \(a distribution on possible wealth outcomes\)  
and denote the mean of the distribution. A customer is said to have *risk-averse*  
*preferences* if he prefers the certain wealth to the lottery *F* itself for all possible  
lotteries *F.* That is, the customer always prefers the certainty of receiving the ex-  
pected wealth rather than a gamble with the same mean. The customer is said to  
have *risk-seeking preferences* if he prefers the gamble *F* to the certain outcome for  
all *F.* Finally, he has *risk-neutral preferences* if he is indifferent between the lottery  
*F* and the certain reward 4 We then have the following result\:  
THEOREM E.5 *A customer’s preference for lotteries exhibits risk-aversion \(risk-*  
*seeking\) behavior if and only if their von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function*  
*is concave \(convex\). Their preference is risk-neutral if and only if is affine.*  
Thus, risk preferences are linked directly to concavity or convexity of the customer’s  
utility function. The reason is quite intuitive; with a concave utility function for  
wealth, a customer gains less utility from a given increase in wealth than he loses in  
utility from the same decrease in wealth. Hence, the upside gains produced by the  
volatility in outcomes do not offset the downside losses, and customers therefore prefer  
the certain average to the uncertain outcomes of the lottery. Since most customers  
have a decreasing marginal utility for wealth, risk aversion is a good assumption in  
modeling customer behavior.  
Still, the concept of risk aversion has to be addressed with care in operational  
modeling. While it is true that most customers are risk-averse when it comes to  
*large* swings in their wealth, often the gambles we face as consumers have a relatively  
small range of possible outcomes relative to our wealth. For example, a customer  
may face a price risk in buying a CD or book online. However, the differences in  
prices for such items are extremely small compared to his total wealth. In such cases,  
the utility function is “almost linear” in the range of outcomes affecting the decision  
and the customer tends to behave “as if” he were risk-neutral.5 Similar statements  
apply to firms. Generally, they are risk-averse too, but for decisions and gambles  
that involve “small” outcomes relative to their total wealth and income, they tend to  
be approximately risk-neutral. Hence, risk-neutrality is a reasonable assumption in  
operational models and, indeed, is the standard assumption in RM practice.  
3The extension of Theorem E.4 to the continuous case requires some additional technical  
conditions that are beyond the scope of this chapter. See Kreps \[313\]. 4Note that a customer’s preferences may not fall into any of these three categories. For exam-  
ple, many consumers take out fire insurance, preferring a certain loss in premium payments  
every year to the gamble between making no payments but potentially loosing their house,  
yet simultaneously play their local state lottery, which has an expected loss but provides a  
small probability of a large wealth pay-off. Such behavior violates a strict risk preference. 5Formally, one can see this by taking a Taylor series approximation of the utility function  
about the customer’s current wealth to; the first-order approximation is affine, corresponding  
to risk-neutrality. 664 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
# Information Asymmetry  
Another important fact related to customer choice is that normally much of a cus-  
tomer’s information is private, information that only the customer “knows” and in-  
formation that cannot be directly observed by a firm. Normally, both a customer’s  
preferences and wealth are private information. One can perhaps gain clues to a  
customer’s preference by observing their purchase behavior over time \(their so-called  
*revealed preferences*\), and partial information on their wealth may be garnered from  
surveys and transactional data. But in general, much of the data affecting customers’  
choice behavior remains hidden.  
This “information asymmetry” between customers and firms has implications for  
pricing and RM as discussed in detail in Chapters 6 and 8. To give a quick sense of the  
effect, consider how customers react to a posted price. Due to information asymmetry,  
the selling firm rarely knows a customer’s true reservation price for their product.  
If they did, they could potentially offer the customer a price only marginally less  
than their reservation price and maximize the revenue obtained from each customer.  
Instead, most firms have to guess at each customer’s reservation price. As a result,  
sometimes they price too high, and the customer does not purchase at all; other times  
they price too low, and although the customer may decide to purchase, they lose an  
opportunity for a revenue gain as the customer would have been willing to pay more.  
In this way, the private information of customers often allows them to retain some  
surplus, even from a monopoly seller.  
# Deviations from Rational Behavior  
While rational behavior is the standard assumption underlying most of the theory  
and practice of RM, it is far from being completely accepted as a model of how an  
actual customer behaves. Indeed, much of the recent work in economics and customer  
behavior has centered on explaining observed, systematic deviations from rationality  
on the part of customers.  
The seminal work in this area is that of Kahneman and Tversky \[278, 277\], who  
showed that customers often exhibit consistent biases when faced with simple choices  
in an experimental setting. Their key insight is that most individuals tend to evaluate  
choice in terms of losses and gains from their status quo wealth, rather than evaluating  
choices in terms of their terminal wealth as in classical utility theory. People also show  
a tendency toward “loss aversion” rather than risk aversion, and they have a strong  
preference for certainty of outcomes when evaluating choices. Finally, how gains and  
losses are expressed matter as well.  
They showed that how questions of choice are “framed” have a large impact on  
customer choice. When choices are framed in terms of gains versus losses, customers  
typically care more about avoiding losses than about making gains. This is true even  
if the “gains” and “losses” amount to exactly the same choice. For example, if a public  
health policy choice is framed as a gain \(200 of 800 diseased people will be saved\) or  
as a loss \(600 of 800 diseased people will die\), most people respond differently, even  
though the outcomes are identical.  
Other experiments revealed that people put a much higher value on a product  
they already own than one that they don’t own because giving up a product they  
have feels like a loss. This behavior is part of the rationale behind the common  
marketing strategy of offering products on a “free 30-day trial”–that customers are  
much more willing to pay to “avoid losing” the trial product than they are willing to *APPENDIX E\: The Theory of Choice* 665  
pay to acquire that same product initially. \(Of course, other simpler explanations—  
such as reassuring the customer of the quality of the product—can also explain such  
guarantees.\)  
Another bias people exhibit is due to what is called *mental accounting,* in which  
customers tend to evaluate gains and losses for different categories of goods differ-  
ently because they have “mental budgets” for each category of goods. For example,  
suppose you purchase a \$1,000 watch and then immediately lose it. You might then  
be reluctant to replace it because in some sense your “budget” for purchasing watches  
has been exhausted. However, suppose you lost \$1,000 in the stock market and you  
did not own a watch at the time. Then you might be willing to buy a new \$1,000  
watch because there is no direct association between the \$1,000 dollar loss and the  
amount you might have “mentally allocated” to spend on a watch \(for example, you  
might account for this as “an investment loss” not a “expensive-watch loss”\). Such  
heuristic accounting again violates the rationality assumptions of classical consumer  
behavior.  
Kahneman and Tversky \[278\] developed what they termed *prospect theory* to ex-  
plain such effects. Prospect theory differs from expected-utility theory in several  
respects. For one, it handles the probabilities of outcomes differently, treating them  
as “decision weights” that may or may not correspond to actual probabilities. In-  
deed, prospect theory postulates that the subjective decision weights used by most  
customers tend to overweigh small probabilities and underweigh high probabilities.  
Prospect theory also uses the notion of “value” rather than “utility,” where value  
is defined in terms of deviations from a reference point \(the customer’s status quo  
wealth\). They postulate an S-shaped curve for the value function, which is convex  
for losses below the reference point and concave for gains above the reference point.  
Using this construct, Kahneman and Tversky \[278\] are able to model and explain  
many observed deviations from rational behavior.  
Do such findings mean that expected utility theory is “dead”? Not really. In  
a gross sense, people do tend to behave in accordance with rationality assumptions.  
However, what this behavioral theory shows quite clearly is that the axioms of rational  
behavior, plausible as they are, do not apply uniformly and that there are situations  
in which deviations from rational behavior are systematic and substantial.  
The main consequence of these findings for RM practice is that one should always  
understand the “environment” in which choices are made; the details of the buying  
situation matter in terms of customers’ responses. How prices are presented, what  
“reference point” the customer perceives, the framing of the choice decision, their  
sense of “ownership” over the product—all can potentially influence their responses.  
While many of the tactics used to influence these factors lie in the domain of general  
marketing and are beyond the scope of this book, the general message that the choice  
environment matters is nevertheless an important one for RM practitioners and re-  
searchers to heed. Indeed, we expect these behavioral theories of demand to influence  
RM practice more directly in the years ahead.This page intentionally left blank**Appendix F**  
# Game Theory  
This appendix provides some elementary facts about game theory and equilibrium  
concepts and should serve as a refresher for those readers with some background in  
game theory. However, for a proper and more complete explanation of the theory,  
the reader should refer to Fudenberg and Tirole \[195\], Myerson \[399\] or Mas-Colell,  
Whinston, and Green \[365\] \(from which the material in this appendix is obtained\).  
Also, Tirole \[513\] provides a User’s Manual on Game Theory.  
# The Normal Form of Games  
A game consists of a set of *players,* the *actions* that they can take \(or in other  
words, the rules of the game\), and the *information* that each player possesses at the  
time he takes his action. For each possible set of actions, the game defines a set of  
*outcomes* and *payoffs* for each player \(such as how much profit or utility each player  
gets\).  
For instance, in the Bertrand pricing game \(Section 8.4.1.4\), there are players  
\(firms in the oligopoly\). Their action space is the prices they set. Each possesses  
information that all the demand goes to the lowest-priced firm, and all have the same  
marginal costs. The outcome is that the demand goes to the lowest-priced firm. The  
payoffs are the revenues minus costs \(profits\).  
Formally, let there be players, let be the collection of player information  
sets and be the set of actions possible for player with information set *H.*  
A *\(pure\) strategy* for player is a function —that is, the player has a  
mapping from each possible information set to a unique action. Moreover, the actions  
have to be feasible, so we assume that the strategy map is such that  
for all Each player, given a set of pure strategies, can also randomize over  
these strategies \(his strategy is to choose one of his pure strategies with a certain  
probability\). This creates what are called *mixed strategies.*  
A game’s actions, outcomes, and payoffs can be defined by an extensive form or  
a normal form. Here we concentrate on the normal form. The normal form of the  
game is a specification of a set of possible strategies for player and a payoff  
function if each player plays strategy The game  
is defined as the triple 668 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
For example, in the Bertrand pricing game with two players, the strategy space for  
player is and the payoff if player 1 plays is where  
and is the market-demand function.  
# Simultaneous Move Static Games  
In the simultaneous move static game, all players move exactly once and make  
their moves simultaneously. Hence, no player knows what the other players’ moves  
are going to be, nor do they have any information on past moves of their opponents  
\(as it is a one-move game\).  
These are rather restrictive assumptions. Nevertheless, such games are applicable  
in some situations \(for instance, a sealed-bid auction\), and they serve as the basis for  
the study of more complicated repeated games.  
Game theory is concerned with predicting the outcomes of a game assuming the  
players are rational \(utility-maximizing players\). To this end, we define the concept  
of *equilibrium,* essentially a prediction of the possible outcomes of the game. There  
are many equilibrium concepts, depending on the nature of the information, and the  
assumptions on players’ behavior.  
We assume that players have *complete information* about the game. Each player  
knows the strategy sets, utility functions, and any other relevant parameters for all  
other players, and they also know that all the other players are rational and, like  
themselves, have complete information.  
# Dominant Strategies  
A strategy is a *dominant strategy* for player if his payoff from playing is  
no less than that from playing any other of his strategies, for all possible strategies  
of the other players.  
Formally, let the the vector of all players other than and represent strategies  
the set of all vectors of all possible strategies of  
all the players other than  
Then, for a game is a dominant strategy if for all  
If rational player has a strictly dominant strategy, it is reasonable to predict he  
would always play that strategy. There are very few games, however, where such  
dominant strategies exist.  
# Nash Equilibrium  
Perhaps the most important and widely accepted notion on the outcome of games  
with rational players is the Nash equilibrium.  
Nash equilibrium, definition A strategy vector **s** is a *\(pure strategy\) Nash equilib-*  
*rium* for the game if for every player given the  
strategies of the other players his strategy* *is optimal, that is, *APPENDIX F\: Game Theory* 669  
If we allow players to randomize over their strategies, then a vector of mixed  
strategies, is a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium if for every player  
given a profile of mixed strategies of the other players player mixed strategy  
is optimal. A game can have no Nash equilibrium, a unique Nash equilibrium, or  
many equilibria \(pure-strategy or mixed\).  
Here are two basic results on the existence of pure and mixed-strategy Nash equi-  
libria.  
PROPOSITION F.16 *Every game with finite strategy sets for all the players has a*  
*mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium.*  
PROPOSITION F.17 *If the strategy sets for the players and compact subsets of is continuous in* **s** *and quasiconcave in then the game has a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.*  
*are nonempty, convex*  
*for all*  
However, in either case, there is no guarantee that the equilibrium is unique.  
# Bayesian Nash Equilibrium  
Games with *incomplete information* model situations where the players do not know  
with certainty what the other players’ strategy sets, parameters, and utility functions  
are. Each forms a probabilistic view of the other players’ private information \(akin to  
a Bayesian prior; this probabilistic view may be updated in a repeated game as the  
game reveals more information to the players\).  
The model is as follows\: Player payoff function is now given by where  
is a random variable whose realization is observed only by player Let  
and However, the joint probability  
is common knowledge among the players. The Bayesian  
distribution of game is then  
A pure-strategy for player a function of the realization of his players player is in this case a decision rule His strategy is  
Given a vector of pure strategies for all the  
payoff is given by the expectation over the  
The extension to the Nash equilibrium concept is then as follows. A *\(pure-strategy\)*  
*Bayesian Nash equilibrium* is a vector of decision rules such  
that  
# Repeated Games  
Finite repeated games are one-shot games that are repeated over a number of  
periods. At the beginning of each period, firms are aware of the others’ past moves  
and make their decisions simultaneously and noncooperatively for that period.  
For example, a repeated Bertrand game would have firms setting prices simultane-  
ously at the beginning of each period, and a repeated Cournot game would have firms  
deciding how much to produce at the beginning of each period. For instance, when  
all the firms in the market post their prices on a centralized industrywide reservation  
system every day, the repeated game’s period is one day, and at the beginning of each  
day firms set prices simultaneously without knowing how the other firms will choose  
their prices that day. 670 *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT*  
Models where moves don’t occur simultaneously but have a leader-follower struc-  
ture are called *Stackelberg* games. It can be shown that the first mover in a Stackelberg  
game has an advantage under certain scenarios \[195\].  
To analyze repeated games, we need a refinement of the Nash equilibrium concept  
known as a *subgame-perfect equilibrium.* Roughly, a subgame-perfect equilibrium is  
one in which the initial equilibrium is simultaneously a Nash equilibrium for any sub-  
game \(the game from any subsequent stage assuming all the information on actions  
from the previous stages\) of the initial game.  
The idea is best illustrated by an example. Consider a *T* period, two-  
player, Bertrand pricing game where prices are the strategic variables. Then  
is subgame-perfect equilibrium if \(i\) it is a Nash-  
equilibrium and \(ii\) for all the decisions  
is a Nash equilibrium for the subgame starting from period to period *T.*  
The subgame-perfect equilibrium refinement allows one to restrict attention to  
strategies that only contain credible threats or promises. For instance, in a two-player,  
two-period Bertrand pricing game, suppose firm one adopts a strategy of pricing high  
in period one and promises to continue to price high in period two provided the  
other firm does not undercut its price in period one. While this may result in a  
Nash equilibrium with both firms pricing high in each period, it does not constitute a  
subgame-perfect equilibrium because once the firms reach period two, it is in firm 1’s  
interest to deviate from it’s announced strategy and undercut its rival’s price. Thus,  
the promise to continue to price high is not credible.  
Infinitely repeated games \(called *supergames*\) provide a richer set of results than  
do finite repeated games. The assumption of infinite interaction may seem excessive,  
but in situations where there are many opportunities for frequent interactions or when  
the end of a game is uncertain, it is a reasonable modeling assumption. **References**
