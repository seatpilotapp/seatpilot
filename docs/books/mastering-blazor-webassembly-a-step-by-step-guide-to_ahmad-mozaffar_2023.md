Other Books You May Enjoy 346 Preface  
Single-page applications \(SPAs\) have become an essential part of modern technology. We have  
become more dependent on browsers than ever before. With the release of Angular, ReactJS, and other  
JavaScript frameworks for developing modern web apps, a big revolution occurred. JavaScript was  
dominant in the field for many years as the only language to be understood and run in browsers. In  
2015, WebAssembly arrived as a technology experiment that allowed browsers to run programming  
languages other than JavaScript, such as C\# and C.  
With WebAssembly, the doors have opened for more powerful web apps and new frameworks to be  
used to build things in browsers. Microsoft was the first adopter of WebAssembly by announcing  
Blazor, a framework that allows .NET developers to build modern and advanced web applications  
using C\# that can run natively in a browser.  
In 2018, when Blazor was still an experimental project of Microsoft's, I started to use it, and I was amazed  
at how powerful it was and the huge potential it had in the world of web and software development  
in general, outside the boundaries of the browser. From that day onward, I started to create packages  
and build demos and production-ready apps with it, until it became the main technology I used for  
my full-time work.  
Mastering Blazor WebAssembly utilizes all my experience in Blazor and .NET to show you, in depth,  
how Blazor WebAssembly works and how you can leverage it, step by step, to build fascinating modern  
web apps that run natively with C\# inside the browser. It will show you how to build the foundations  
you need to use Blazor WebAssembly to build cross-platform mobile and desktop apps by utilizing  
.NET MAUI and Blazor WebAssembly.  
The book begins by introducing Blazor WebAssembly and how to set up a new project. Then, it  
covers all the features and concepts of Blazor WebAssembly with practical examples and theoretical  
explanations. You will learn how Blazor WebAssembly works internally and how to use it effectively.  
By the end of this book, you will have developed a complete, workable, and efficient test application  
that you can publish to the cloud.  
# Who this book is for  
This book targets existing .NET developers who are excited to start their journey with developing  
SPAs, using their own C\# skills without learning JS frameworks, JS developers who have heard about  
Blazor and want to discover its superpower and simplicity for web development, and every geek who  
wants to discover and learn how things work under the hood, step by step. xvi

# Blazor WebAssembly Essentials  
This part will introduce you to Blazor WebAssembly and guide you to set up your first Blazor project.  
After that, you will learn about the concept of components, which are the building blocks of every  
Blazor app. You will start by using Razor and C\# to create basic and advanced components, and then  
you will learn how to use parameters in Blazor to implement communication between app components,  
and how to style them. You will also learn about different types of components, such as layouts and  
templated components, and how to employ a Razor class library for reusability.  
This part has the following chapters\:

# Understanding the Anatomy of  
# a Blazor WebAssembly Project  
Blazor has become a trend in the world of software development, due to its simplicity, productivity,  
and wide-ranging applicability in web, mobile, and desktop application development via .NET Multi-  
platform App UI \(MAUI\) \(more about MAUI in Chapter 15, What’s Next?\). Thus, it is beneficial for  
developers to learn about and master this framework.  
This book will help you master Blazor WebAssembly by building a new project in Visual Studio until  
you have a fully functional app that is secure, robust, deployed online, and ready to be consumed by  
the public.  
In this chapter, we are going to walk you through the basic structure of a Blazor WebAssembly  
standalone application. We will start by creating the project using the various methods available on  
different platforms, including the Visual Studio IDE, Visual Studio Code, and the .NET CLI. You will  
then learn about the general structure of the project and what each file contains and why it’s there.  
You will also learn about dependency injection \(DI\), how to register and inject services, and how to  
store and retrieve the configuration of your application in single or multiple environments.  
By the end of this chapter, you will have a good idea of the structure of the application we will be  
building in the later chapters of this book.  
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics\:  
•  
•

# Technical requirements  
To follow along with this chapter and the rest of the book, you need to know the basic concepts of the  
C\# programming language and the fundamentals of web development.  
The development process will require Visual Studio 2022 Community, which can be downloaded for  
free for Windows devices from https\://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community,  
and for macOS devices from https\://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/.  
Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio Code for any OS \(Windows, macOS, or Linux\) by downloading  
it from https\://code.visualstudio.com/download.  
If you are not going to be installing Visual Studio 2022, you need to make sure that the .NET 7.0 SDK  
is available on your computer. This SDK generally gets downloaded along with Visual Studio 2022. If  
you don’t have the SDK, you can install it from https\://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/  
download.  
In later chapters, we will mostly be using Visual Studio 2022 for Windows, but all the concepts will be  
applicable to Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio Code with the .NET CLI.

# Creating your first Blazor WebAssembly project  
Let us start our journey by creating our Blazor WebAssembly project using the .NET CLI, and then  
we will do the same using Visual Studio 2022 and will build on top of that for the rest of the book.  
Using the .NET CLI  
To create a Blazor WebAssembly project using .NET CLI, go through the following steps\:  
1. Open Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS and execute the following command\:  
dotnet new blazorwasm -n BooksStore  
2. The preceding command will create a new Blazor WebAssembly project in a folder called  
BooksStore within the directory you executed this command in, and the project will be  
called BooksStore.  
You can build your app using the build command after navigating to the newly created  
folder as follows\:  
cd BooksStore\\  
dotnet build  
3\. Next, you can run the project\:  
dotnet run Creating your first Blazor WebAssembly project 5  
When the app runs, you will see two URLs on the CLI\: one for the https link and the other for  
an http link. Navigate to the https link in your browser and you will be able to see the final result  
of the default Blazor WebAssembly app made available out of the box by .NET 7.0\:

Congratulations! You have seen the famous purple UI; now, we are ready to move ahead and start  
discovering the purpose of each of those files and folders.  
# Discovering the project structure  
Now we have a workspace that we can use to start building our application, but before we dive in deeper,  
let’s take a look at the structure of the project, including the files and folders we see. Understanding the  
what and why of each file in Solution Explorer is key to completing the project we will be building.  
Let’s start exploring!  
The wwwroot folder  
The wwwroot folder is considered the root folder of your project. Root, here, doesn’t mean the root  
in your file explorer, which is the one that contains the Razor files and other folders. wwwroot is  
the place where your app's static files, including global CSS styles, the main HTML file of the project,  
index.html, JavaScript, and assets \(images, icons, static documents, etc.\), live. It’s also where you  
put the JSON files that represent the configuration of your app \(you will read more about configuration  
in the next section of this chapter, Dependency injection in Blazor WebAssembly\).  
By default, the wwwroot folder contains the following\:  
•  
•  
The css folder\: This folder comes with Bootstrap CSS files and the default font. The folder  
also includes the app.css file, which carries the global styles of the app.  
The sample-data folder\: This folder contains a JSON file with sample data pertaining  
to a weather forecast. This is used as a data source for the Fetch data page, which will be  
mentioned soon.  
•  
•  
favicon.ico\: This refers to the default icon of the app that you see at the top left of the  
browser tab of your application, in the favorite sites list in the browser, and in some other places.  
Icon-192.png\: This is the Blazor icon PNG file that’s referenced in the components.  
•  
index.html\: The name of this file should be familiar to you. Most of the time, index.html  
is the default HTML file that will be opened when we access a static website. This main HTML  
file contains our app. The browser downloads this file and opens it with all its references from  
CSS and JavaScript, most importantly blazor.webassembly.js.  
The body of index.html contains, by default, a div with the ID app \(this is basically where  
all the UI that you see in any Blazor app resides\), and another div with the ID blazor-  
error-ui, which is a simple design div that shows up when an unhandled exception occurs  
\(you will learn more about this in Chapter 10, Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly\).  
While developing your apps, you are going to make changes to this file mostly to add style  
references or some JavaScript files later in this book. Discovering the project structure 9  
The following is the code for the default body elements \(app div and blazor-error-ui  
div\) within the index.html file\:  
\<html lang="en"\>  
….  
\<body\>  
\<div id="app"\>Loading...\</div\>  
\<div id="blazor-error-ui"\>  
An unhandled error has occurred.  
\<a href="" class="reload"\>Reload\</a\>  
\<a class="dismiss"\>🗙\</a\>  
\</div\>  
\<script  
src="\_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"\>\</script\>  
\</body\>  
\</html\>  
Note  
The term Single-Page Application \(SPA\) seems a bit weird when you open the app and start  
navigating from one page to another. However, technically SPAs consist of a single HTML page  
and Blazor or any other JavaScript framework \(ReactJS, Angular, etc.\) dynamically updates the  
content of that page. As you have seen, in the wwwroot folder, there is only one HTML page  
in our whole application, called index.html.  
The Pages folder  
Pages is the default folder where Microsoft puts its default pages that come with the template. You  
can use Pages as the container for your app’s page components. However, it’s not mandatory to put  
your components in this folder and you can even delete it. Pages comes with three sample pages  
that cover different concepts, such as calling a shared component, updating the DOM using a button,  
and fetching data from a data source\:  
•  
Counter.razor\: This is a Razor component that you can access through the route /  
counter. This is also an example of calling a C\# method from an HTML button and binding  
an HTML \<p\> element’s content to a C\# variable to show the result.  
•  
FetchData.razor\: You can access this component by navigating to /fetch-data. This  
page contains an HTML table that shows weather forecast data and demonstrates how to fetch  
data using the HttpClient. By injecting the object and making an HTTP GET request to  
grab the JSON data from the weather.json file in the wwwroot folder, the data is rendered  
within the component. 10  
Understanding the Anatomy of a Blazor WebAssembly Project  
•  
Index.razor\: This is the default component that you will see when you run the project.  
It shows you how to call other shared components such as SurveryPrompt and pass the  
Title parameter to it.  
The Shared folder  
As the name indicates, this folder holds some shared components across the app. You can override  
this structure, but we are going to follow the same structure through the rest of this book and will use  
this folder to contain the components that will be shared across all the pages \(app layout, nav menu,  
authentication components, etc.\). By default, the Blazor template comes with three shared components\:  
•  
MainLayout.razor\: This comprises the default layout of the project and is a special kind  
of component. It defines what the app looks like and allocates the content components \(pages\)  
to the right place.  
By default, this component references the NavMenu component and contains a \<main\> HTML  
tag that renders the @Body property. This property holds the content of the pages based on  
the navigated route \(more about layout components will be covered in Chapter 3, Developing  
Advanced Components in Blazor\).  
•  
•  
NavMenu.razor\: This component contains the menu items of the app \(a set of URLs to  
navigate between the pages mentioned in the Pages folder\).  
SuveryPrompt.razor\: This is a simple component to demonstrate how to create a reusable  
component that accepts parameters. The Index page references this component and passes  
a value for its Title parameter.  
The \_Imports.razor file  
In C\# classes, you always need to use classes existing in different namespaces. So, basically, we reference  
a namespace by declaring a using statement at the top of the C\# file so we can reference the required  
classes and nested namespaces. The \_Imports.razor file is there for this purpose, and you can  
use it to reference common namespaces across the majority of your components. So, there is no need  
to add a using statement at the top of each Razor file to access the required code. By default, the  
component references some common .NET namespaces that you will use across your components,  
such as System.Net.Http and the namespace of your assembly and the shared folder.  
The following is the code for the \_imports.razor file with the shared referenced namespaces\:  
@using System.Net.Http  
…  
@using Microsoft.JSInterop  
@using BooksStore  
@using BooksStore.Shared Dependency injection in Blazor WebAssembly 11  
The App.razor file  
The App component is the parent and the main component of the Blazor app. It basically defines  
the infrastructure required for your application to function, such as the Router component, which  
matches the URL entered in the browser and renders the associated component in your app. The App  
component also defines the default layout component \(MainLayout, mentioned in the Shared  
folder\). More about layout components will be covered in Part 2, Chapter 3, Developing Advanced  
Components in Blazor. Further, the App component contains the NotFound section, which you can  
use to render specific content if the requested address was not found.  
The Program.cs file  
In any C\# application, there is an entry point and Program.cs represents the entry point of your  
Blazor app. This entry point sets up the Blazor WebAssembly host and maps the App component  
to the corresponding div within the index.html file \(by default, the div with the ID app\). We  
also use the file to register any service that we need to use throughout the application’s lifetime in the  
DI container.  
Now you should be able to navigate easily within the solution after understanding what every file does  
and why it’s there; the next step in this chapter is looking at the concept of DI.  
# Dependency injection in Blazor WebAssembly  
Modern software development is all about scaling, separation, and testing, so when you write the code,  
you should feel confident about its behavior and reliability. To achieve that goal, you need to keep the  
SOLID principles in mind throughout your development journey. The principle represented by the  
letter D is dependency inversion. This basically refers to hiding the implementation of your services  
behind interfaces. For example, for each service class you have, you can create an interface that contains  
the methods of that class, and make the class implement the interface. Then, while consuming this  
service, you reference the interface instead of the class directly. This strategy decouples the components  
or code pieces that use a service from its implementation by depending on the service’s abstract layer,  
which is the interface.  
All this is amazing, but there is one missing part\: how to initialize the object of a service that will  
be used in more than one place. This is where DI comes into play. It’s simply a technique that allows  
you to register your services that are used in other services or components in a centralized container,  
and that container will be responsible for serving those objects to the components that require them. 12  
Understanding the Anatomy of a Blazor WebAssembly Project  
How dependency injection works  
The following diagram shows the flow of a ConsoleLoggingService class\:  
Figure 1.7 – The flow of the dependency injection container and associated services  
In the preceding figure, the ConsoleLoggingService class implements the ILoggingService  
interface. Then, in the DI container, we register an instance of ILoggingService with a new object  
of its implementation\: ConsoleLoggingService. Whenever Component A requires logging logic,  
it uses ILoggingService \(the abstraction layer of ConsoleLoggingService\).  
Instead of initializing a new object instance ourselves, the DI container is serving ILoggingService  
to Component A, which adds many benefits as it keeps the code separated. Further, the implementation  
logic for the full service could be changed at any time without touching Component A, which depends  
on the base interface of that service. For example, if we want to log the data to a server instead of the  
console to start using the new service, we can just write a new implementation of ILoggingService  
and register that instance in the DI container, without changing anything in Component A or any  
other client code.  
Note  
To learn more about the SOLID principles and software development, check out the following  
link\: https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID Dependency injection in Blazor WebAssembly 13  
Using dependency injection in Blazor WebAssembly  
Blazor WebAssembly comes with a DI container out of the box. You can start by registering your services  
in the Program.cs file and then inject those services into the client components or services as well.  
Let’s implement or write our first service, ILoggingService, as mentioned in the preceding  
section, with the Log method, and create an implementation to log the messages to the console  
window of the browser. Then, we will inject this service into the FetchData component and log  
the count of the weather data that the FetchData component gets. To implement the service, go  
through the following steps\:  
1. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the project, and click on Add | New Folder. Name the  
folder Services.  
Figure 1.8 – Adding a new folder through Solution Explorer 14  
Understanding the Anatomy of a Blazor WebAssembly Project  
2\. 3. 4. Right-click on the newly created folder and choose Add | New Item.  
From the dialog that shows up, choose Interface as the item type, and give it the name  
ILoggingService. Then click Add.  
The interface has been created, and the goal is to create the Log method. As you know, in the  
interfaces, we only define the signature of the method \(its return data type and its parameter\),  
so we will define that method as follows\:  
public interface ILoggingService  
\{  
void Log\(string message\);  
\}  
5\. 6. After creating the interface, we should create the implementation that logs that message to the  
console, so repeat step 2, but instead of creating an interface, let’s create a class and give it  
the name ConsoleLoggingService.  
After creating the class, let’s implement the ILoggingService interface and write the logic  
of that method as follows\:  
public class ConsoleLoggingService \: ILoggingService  
\{  
public void Log\(string message\)  
\{  
Console.WriteLine\(message\);  
\}  
\}  
7. The Log method calls the WriteLine method in the Console class, but in Blazor WebAssembly  
the Console.WriteLine method doesn’t act the same as it does in other .NET apps by  
printing a string in a console app. It prints the string in the console window within the developer  
tools of the browser.  
You can access the developer tools in your browser as follows\:  
 Microsoft Edge\: F12 in Windows or ⌘ + ⌥ + I for Mac  
 Other browsers\: Ctrl + Shift + I  
The last thing to get this service ready to be injected into other components is registering it  
in the DI container.  
Go to the Program.cs file and register the service using the AddScoped method\:  
...  
using BooksStore.Services;  
var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault\(args\);  
...  
builder.Services.AddScoped\<ILoggingService, Dependency injection in Blazor WebAssembly 15  
ConsoleLoggingService\>\(\);  
await builder.Build\(\).RunAsync\(\);  
Our first service right now is ready to be used and injected within any other components. The following  
example will show you how to inject this service in the FetchData component and achieve the  
required target of logging the count of weather forecast items to the console window of the browser\:  
1. Open the \_Imports.razor file and add a using statement to the Services namespaces\:  
@using BooksStore.Services  
We add references to the Services namespace in the imports because those services will  
mostly be used across many components, so we don’t have to add that using statement in  
every component.  
Open the FetchData component in the Pages folder and inject ILoggingService by  
using the @inject Razor directive in the component\:  
@page "/fetchdata"  
...  
@inject ILoggingService LoggingService  
\<PageTitle\>Weather forecast\</PageTitle\>  
\<h1\>Weather forecast\</h1\>  
....  
2. Our service is ready to be used and we can call the Log function from the object instance in  
the C\# code to log the count of the items as follows\:  
....  
\</tbody\>  
\</table\>  
\}  
@code \{  
private WeatherForecast\[\]? forecasts;  
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
forecasts = await  
Http.GetFromJsonAsync\<WeatherForecast\[\]\>  
\("sample-data/weather.json"\);  
LoggingService.Log\(\$"Number of items retrieved  
is \{forecasts.Count\(\)\}"\);  
\}  
… 16  
Understanding the Anatomy of a Blazor WebAssembly Project  
If you run the project and navigate to the Fetch data page after the data is retrieved, you can open the  
console window in your browser and you should see the message Number of items retrieved is 5.

To learn more about the DI concept in Blazor, you can check the following link\: https\://  
learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/fundamentals/  
dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-7.0.  
Now we have implemented a full cycle, from creating the service abstract layer to its implementation,  
registering the service in the DI container, and finally injecting and consuming that service from a  
separate component.  
Learning about DI and how it works will help you understand many aspects of the application, such  
as writing maintainable, decoupled services. Also, you will be able to consume built-in services such  
as the HttpClient to make API calls and the IConfiguration service, which we are going to  
use in the next section to read and consume the application configurations.  
# Creating, storing, and retrieving the app configurations  
Configurations are a set of settings that your application uses throughout its lifetime. App configurations  
help you avoid hard-coding some values within your app that could change from time to time. Also,  
the process is very important when dealing with multiple environments. For example, you can store  
the URL of the API that your app is communicating with. While on the dev machine, the URL is the  
localhost, in the production environment it refers to the online hosted API \(more about environments  
will be covered in the next section\). Creating, storing, and retrieving the app configurations 17  
Blazor WebAssembly already supports configuration out of the box from JSON files that could be created  
in the wwwroot folder. The file must be called appsettings.json and to have a configuration  
file for each environment, you can specify further, for example, appsettings.\{ENVIRONMENT\}.  
json or appsettings.Development.json.  
Important note  
You can add additional sources for configuration but appsettings files are enough as the  
Blazor WebAssembly app is running fully on the client side. Connecting the app, for example,  
to the Azure Key Vault service means the connection string will live on the client and be under  
threat of being exposed easily.  
So, for general configurations, appsettings is a great choice. Other kinds of secrets are  
highly recommended to be stored server-side and we should architect our app in a way that  
the client doesn’t need to fetch or use them.  
We will create a configuration file and store some settings such as the URL of the API that we will use.  
Then, we will print that value with the Index component. Let’s get started\:  
1\. 2. Right-click on the wwwroot folder and add a new item of type JSON file and call  
it appsettings.json.  
Add a property called "ApiUrl" and give it a value of "http\://localhost\:44332/"  
as follows\:  
\{  
"ApiUrl"\: "http\://localhost\:44332"  
\}  
After saving the file, you can access this setting value directly using the IConfiguration service  
by injecting it into any component or service and referring to the index of your property name.  
In the following example, we will inject the IConfiguration service in the Index component  
and print the value of the ApiUrl property\:  
1. Open the Index.razor file within the Pages folder and inject the IConfiguration  
service as shown\:  
@page "/"  
@inject IConfiguration Configuration  
\<PageTitle\>Index\</PageTitle\>  
... 18  
Understanding the Anatomy of a Blazor WebAssembly Project  
2. After the service is injected, you are ready to access the required value by using the indexer  
of the Configuration instance. We are going to add a \<p\> tag and display the following\:  
Api Url\: \{API\_URL\_VALUE\_IN\_SETTINGS\}\:  
...  
\<h1\>Hello, world!\</h1\>  
Welcome to your new app.  
\<p\>Api Url\: @Configuration\["ApiUrl"\]\</p\>  
...  
After running the application, you should see the following result in your browser window\:  
Figure 1.10 – The value of the configuration ApiUrl from appsettings.json  
Configurations are important to you in your learning journey, and while developing our real-world  
application we are going to use them from time to time. After the example we have given, you should  
have a clear understanding of how to add configurations and how to retrieve their values in the  
runtime of the app.  
In the next section, we will be introducing new environments to our application, and we will add a  
new configuration file that we will use only while running the app locally on the dev machine using  
the dotnet run command or by debugging the app from within VS 22.  
# Managing application environments  
Software development goes through various stages. In the beginning, we may start with pure development  
and testing, but after we start rolling out our application to production, many challenges will appear.  
One of these challenges is having different environments for your app run to on.  
For example, imagine your application is communicating with an API and this API is developed by  
another developer or team. The application is hosted on Azure App Service with two deployment  
slots \(Dev/Production\). During development, you are going to use the URL of the dev API, which  
won’t make changes to the production database, and after committing your changes, in the production  
environment, you need to use the URL of the Production slot. Managing application environments 19  
In this scenario, it will be tough to change the API URL before you push to production and then  
retrieve it after finishing. Thus, many mistakes may be made, which will make the development process  
frustrating. This is where managing environments comes into play, where you can write code, render  
a specific UI, or retrieve special configurations based on the environment that your app is running in  
without making too many mistakes that delay development and production.  
By default, when you run the Blazor app through the debugger, it runs within the development  
environment, and after publishing it, it runs within the production one.  
In this section, we will see how we can set up and retrieve the current environment of the application  
and retrieve the configuration based on that.  
Creating a configuration file based on the environment  
To create a configuration file that will be used only in the development phase, you can create another  
appsettings.json file but with the name of the environment before the extension, such as  
appsettings.Development.json. To implement this, take the following steps\:  
1\. 2. Right-click on the wwwroot folder and click on Add | New Item. Choose a JSON file and give  
it the name appsettings.Development.json.  
Add the same "ApiUrl" property that exists in appsettings.json and the value  
"Development" as follows\:  
\{  
"ApiUrl"\: "Development"  
\}  
When you run the application, you will notice that the value of Development will show up on the  
screen instead of http\://localhost\:44332. You should follow the practice of separating the  
settings based on the environment from the very beginning, so it makes the development process  
smoother and easier.  
Reading the environment within the components  
In your development process and where there are many environments for your app \(development,  
preview, and production, for example\), you need a specific piece of UI or certain logic to make the  
app behave differently in different environments. A major implementation to achieve this kind of  
responsiveness is showing a specific feature in preview but hiding it in production.  
To achieve the mentioned behavior, you need to fetch the value of the current environment in your  
code and use an if condition to determine how the UI or logic behaves within that environment. 20  
Understanding the Anatomy of a Blazor WebAssembly Project  
In the following example, we are going to use IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment by injecting  
it within the Index component and remove the SurveyPrompt component if the app is running  
on the development environment\:  
1. Open the Index component within the Pages folder and inject the  
IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment service within the component, but of course, you need  
to reference the namespace that contains the service, which is Microsoft.AspNetCore.  
Components.WebAssembly.Hosting, as shown in the following snippet\:  
@page "/"  
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting  
...  
@inject IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment Host  
\<PageTitle\>Index\</PageTitle\>  
...  
2. The next step is to use the IsDevelopment method, which returns a bool if the current  
environment is equal to Development\:  
...  
\<p\>Api Url\: @Configuration\["ApiUrl"\]\</p\>  
@if \(!Host.IsDevelopment\(\)\)  
\{  
\<SurveyPrompt  
Title="How is Blazor working for you?" /\>  
\}  
After running the application on your machine in debugging mode, the SuveryPrompt component  
will be shown in the production environment. This example demonstrates the responsiveness of  
environment features, which is very useful.  
Tip  
IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment contains multiple methods like IsDevelopment\(\).  
It also contains IsStaging\(\) and IsProduction\(\). You can also customize the name  
by using IsEnvionment\("CUSTOM\_ENVIORNEMNT\_NAME"\).  
One of the topics to be covered is setting the current environment explicitly. We are going to cover this  
in Chapter 14, Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps, after publishing the project, but you can go deeper  
by reading and discovering more about environments at https\://learn.microsoft.com/  
en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/fundamentals/environments?view=aspnetcore-7.0. Summary 21  
# Summary  
Over the course of this chapter, we have learned the fundamentals of each Blazor WebAssembly  
application, from setting up the development tools to creating the first application using the .NET  
CLI and Visual Studio 2022. We also discovered the anatomy and the structure of the application by  
defining the purpose of each file and why it’s there. We looked at DI, created our first service, injected  
it within a component, and explored the reasons why it’s important in modern software development.  
Configurations are an essential part of each application. To avoid hard-coded values within your code,  
you need to keep the environment that your application is running on in consideration. This extra care  
can make your development experience easier, especially after publishing an application to production  
while other features are still under development. Managing the environments and configurations  
helps with overcoming inconsistencies in development and managing the part under development.  
In the next chapter, you will start the real action with Blazor by exploring and developing the basics  
of app components, which are the main building blocks of a Blazor app.

# Components in Blazor  
Components are the main building blocks of each Blazor application. Each component is a self-  
contained piece of the user interface \(UI\) and its related logic, and comprises a dynamic part of the  
application UI. A Blazor application is basically a set of components placed together, each of which  
has its own responsibility within the UI, and the interaction of these components builds up the full  
app that we are aiming for in this book.  
In this chapter, we are going to understand the concept of components from scratch, create our first  
component, and then use it. We will discover the available mechanisms to pass data between components  
by introducing parameters, cascading parameters, and event callbacks.  
After that, we will look at the component life cycle events and how we can leverage them during the  
component’s lifetime. Finally, we will add some CSS styling for a better look.

# Understanding the concept of components  
A Blazor application basically consists of a set of components working together to form rich dynamic  
applications. Blazor components are formally known as Razor components in which C\# and HTML  
code are combined and the file extension .razor is used. Components can be nested within each  
other, shared, and reused by a different project. 24  
Components in Blazor  
While developing your Blazor application, you should think about it as an organization, where each  
component is an employee responsible for a certain task. The collaboration of those employees together  
is what represents the workflow of the organization. The same concept applies to a Blazor app in which  
every component should have a clear and specific role in the app UI. At the same time, each component  
should be able to receive corresponding data from other components to get its part of work done.  
The following screenshot shows a sample podcast application \(Productive+, which I developed for  
tracking how I use my time\) built with Blazor\:  
Figure 2.1 – An application I have built, which is split into small components that make up the full UI.  
The source code for this sample app is available at https\://github.com/aksoftware98/productivity-plus  
The preceding figure demonstrates how a specific application UI contains multiple components  
that together provide us with an advanced, rich UI. The page itself is also a component with nested  
components contained within it. Finally, all components are hosted together within the App.razor  
component, which is the root of each application. Understanding the concept of components 25  
Now, before we get started creating our first component, let’s understand the Razor file and syntax  
that we use to build the components.  
Introduction to Razor  
Blazor components are Razor files that give us a super powerful engine to build absolutely dynamic  
and interactive pieces of UI.  
Component files must have a name starting with an uppercase letter, for example, AlertMessage.  
razor. If you instead name a component alertMessage.razor, you will face a compile-time  
error, which will prevent the compiler from building the application.  
If we look at the pre-built Counter.razor component that comes with new Blazor projects \(the  
component results in a default page existing in every new Blazor app and is called Counter\) in the  
following code snippet, we can notice the syntax of the Razor component, in addition to the mix of  
the C\# code and HTML\:  
@page "/counter"  
\<PageTitle\>Counter\</PageTitle\>  
\<h1\>Counter\</h1\>  
\<p role="status"\>Current count\: @currentCount\</p\>  
\<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount"\>Click me\</  
button\>  
@code \{  
private int currentCount = 0;  
private void IncrementCount\(\)  
\{  
currentCount++;  
\}  
\}  
As you may notice, the Counter component is basically written using the normal HTML tags in  
addition to a piece of C\# code that contains a method called IncrementCount\(\), and a private  
member called currentCount.  
In the paragraph tag that comes with the component, the project references the C\# private int  
member in the text using the @ char as a prefix. The same applies to the onclick event of the button  
by referencing the method to increment the count of that variable.  
Getting started with building components using Razor is a straightforward process as the code doesn’t  
include any complicated sections or initializations; just design your UI using HTML alongside your  
C\# code. It really is as simple as that.  
However, before we get started creating our first component, let’s introduce the syntax and the available  
ways to write C\# expressions combined with HTML code. In addition to defining some Razor-reserved  
keywords, we can define some specifications for our components through Razor directives. 26  
Components in Blazor  
Razor syntax  
Let’s deep dive into Razor syntax and discover the available Razor expressions that we will use to  
write our components’ code\:  
•  
Implicit Razor expressions\: These expressions comprise the first and simplest expressions  
to employ C\# code between HTML tags\: constructors from the @ symbol followed by a C\#  
member. After compiling the project, the result of this expression will be rendered and shown  
in the HTML.  
The following is an example from our Counter.razor component\:  
\<p role="status"\>Current count\: @currentCount\</p\>  
In the preceding code, we can see the expression with the currentCount variable in the  
paragraph tag.  
The evaluation of the previous line is that the value of the variable will be rendered in the  
HTML tag as follows\:  
\<p role="status"\>Current count\: 0 \</p\>  
•  
Explicit Razor expressions\: The syntax of these expressions gives you more flexibility to combine  
complex C\# expressions. They use the syntax of the @ symbol followed by two parentheses  
\(..\) that contain the C\# expressions to be evaluated and rendered.  
The following example shows the evaluation of the currentCount variable and whether it’s  
an even number as a Boolean result \(True, False\)\:  
\<p\>Is Even\: @\(currentCount % 2 == 0\)\</p\>  
The rendering of the previous line, if the value of the currentCount variable was 4, would  
produce the following HTML\:  
\<p\>Is Even\: True \</p\>  
•  
C\# code blocks\: This type allows you to write blocks of C\# code for your Blazor component,  
and the code inside won’t be rendered into HTML. Instead, the code will be declared and  
executed within a component object.  
The syntax of the C\# code blocks includes the @ symbol in addition to the code keyword  
followed by two curly brackets \{ \} that contain the C\# code. Back to the example of the  
Counter.razor, we can see how the code block is being used to create a variable and a  
function to manipulate the value of that variable as follows\:  
@code \{  
private int currentCount = 0;  
private void IncrementCount\(\)  
\{ Understanding the concept of components 27  
currentCount++;  
\}  
\}  
Razor directives  
Behind the scenes, each Razor component is a C\# class that gets generated by the Razor engine after  
parsing it. Razor has what are called directives to provide us with a technique to manipulate the  
process of this parsing and give some control over some functionalities or the specifications of that  
generated class.  
Razor has two kinds of directives that are divided based on how we can apply them\:  
•  
Directives\: These help manipulate the parsing, specifications, and functionality of the component,  
and are applied to the component overall  
•  
Directive attributes\: These directives are applied to some tags and provide some functionality  
to and manipulation of that specific element  
Let’s go over some of the most-used directives in Razor components in the following table and define  
the purpose of each\:  
Directive Usage  
@page Makes the component routable by registering it in the router of the  
application and makes it accessible through a specific URL when  
requested in the browser through\:  
@page "/counter"  
We will discuss this further in Chapter 4, Navigation and Routing.  
@namespace Enables you to set an explicit namespace for your component through\:  
@namespace BooksStore.Client.Components  
By default, the namespace of the component is the name of the project  
followed by the name of the folders it exists inside.  
@inherits Makes the component class inherit from a specific type \(implementing  
inheritance for your component\) through\:  
@inherits MyBaseComponent  
@inject Injects a specific service in the component from the DI  
container through\:  
@inject ILoggingService LoggingService 28  
Components in Blazor  
Directive Usage  
@code Defines a C\# code block\:  
@code  
\{  
int currentCount = 0;  
// More C\# Code goes here  
\}  
@using References a namespace in your component using\:  
@using System.Linq  
@layout Defines the layout that will be used for your component\:  
@layout BlankLayout  
We will discuss this further in Chapter 3, Developing Advanced Components  
in Blazor.  
@bind Implements data binding\:  
\<input @bind-Value="currentValue" /\>  
We will discuss this in Chapter 3, Developing Advanced Components in Blazor.  
@implements Implements an interface\:  
@implements IDisposable  
Tip  
Razor components support partial classes. Razor components are basically C\# classes, so you  
can have the HTML, markup, and C\# logic in the same file, or you can have your markup in  
the .razor file and the C\# code in a separate C\# class file with the component’s name and  
the same base type, but with the partial keyword, which allows you to divide the same C\#  
class into many files.  
This practice is recommended when the C\# logic of the component is huge as it helps keep  
your files small and more organized in addition to leveraging the full power of the C\# editor  
in your IDE.  
To learn more about partial classes support in Blazor, see https\://docs.microsoft.  
com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/?view=aspnetcore-  
7.0\#partial-class-support. Understanding the concept of components 29  
Building your first Razor component  
After introducing the concept of components and learning the fundamentals of a Blazor component  
file and its syntax, it’s time to put what we have learned into action.  
We are going to create our first component, which will be a book card to display a book on our  
application. We will start from scratch, and then add more functionalities and styling on the go  
throughout the chapter. So, let’s get started\:  
1\. Create a Razor component file in the Shared folder by right-clicking on the folder in Visual  
Studio. Choose Add | Razor component, give it the name BookCard.razor, and then  
click Add.  
We have created the component in the Shared folder because it is a shared component and  
will be used across multiple pages.  
2\. 3. After you create the file, you are ready to start writing your first markup.  
We will write a basic HTML design for a card that contains some info about the book, and the  
button to add the book to the cart, as follows\:  
\<div style="border\:1px solid black; padding\:3px"\>  
\<h6\>Book 01\</h6\>  
\<p\>Author\: Author Name\</p\>  
\<p\>Publishing date\: 2022-07-02\</p\>  
\<button style="width\:100%"\>Add to Cart\</button\>  
\</div\>  
4. Now we have a fixed piece of HTML, but this can be reused in many components, and that’s  
what we are going to achieve in the last step.  
To render a component in another component, all we need to do is reference the name of that  
component within double tags, \<\>. To achieve that in our example, let’s open the Index.  
razor component within the Pages folder and reference our book card there.  
The updated file should look like the following\:  
...  
\<PageTitle\>Index\</PageTitle\>  
\<h1\>Hello, world!\</h1\>  
Welcome to your new app.  
\<BookCard /\>  
... 30  
Components in Blazor  
Now we are ready to see our first reusable Razor component by running the project using the start  
button in Visual Studio. The Index component will automatically open as it’s the default component,  
and we should see our book card there, as shown in the following screenshot\:  
Figure 2.2 – The result of the rendered BookCard component on the Index page  
Congratulations! You have successfully created and used your first Razor component after learning  
the basics of components in general and Razor specifically. We can now take a step ahead by making  
our component a bit dynamic via the different methods to send data from the parent components to  
the children, and in the opposite direction, by using Parameters, CascadingParameters,  
and EventCallbacks.  
# Moving data among components  
Methods in C\# work by accepting parameters to process and return other types of data post processing.  
Blazor components work according to the exact same concept. Because each component represents  
a piece of UI alongside its logic, there is always the need to give the component some data for it to  
function according to the set logic. So functionally, a Blazor component either renders the data that  
is input in a certain way, or responds based on the set logic.  
A Blazor component, in some cases, requires some data as an input either to render the data in the  
UI or to control its internal logic based on the values provided. Also, in many scenarios, components  
have the ability to send data back to the parent. The effective collaboration of the app components by  
communicating with each other provides us with the clean, well-functioning, and effective app that  
we are trying to build.  
Luckily, Blazor provides us with powerful mechanisms to allow the transfer of data between components  
and in different directions \(from parent components to children, and vice versa\). Moving data among components 31  
Now it’s time to discover these mechanisms and apply them to the component we created in the  
preceding section.  
Parameters  
A Blazor component can accept parameters just like any C\# method, but the definition of parameters  
in Blazor is way different. Parameters in Blazor components are C\# properties decorated with the  
\[Parameter\] attribute, and we then set their values by passing them as attributes while calling  
the component.  
So, let’s get started adding some parameters to our BookCard component to parametrize the data  
of it by accepting this data as parameters instead of hardcoded values in the HTML.  
To achieve this, we need to add the @code section to our component and define the following  
parameters \(Title, PublishingDate, and Author\), but the properties of the object \(book\)  
could change from time to time during the application development cycle. So instead of passing each  
property as a parameter, we can create a Book class and then pass the book object to the component.  
This practice will help the maintainability of your Blazor components because when you add new  
properties to your model, you don’t need to add the corresponding parameter to the component or  
even to multiple components using the same model. There is also no need to add those new properties  
as attributes when calling the component. To achieve all of this, we need to do the following\:  
1\. 2. 3. Right-click on the project, then choose Add | New Folder and give it the name Models; the  
folder will contain the models that we will use in our project.  
Add a new C\# class called Book within the Models folder by right-clicking on the folder,  
choosing Add | New Item, adding a C\# class, and giving it the name Book.cs.  
Next, we need to add the properties of the book to the created class. The properties we need  
are Title, PublishingDate, and AuthorName, so the class file should look like this\:  
namespace BooksStore.Models;  
public class Book  
\{  
public string? Title \{ get; set; \}  
public string? AuthorName \{ get; set; \}  
public DateTime PublishingDate \{ get; set; \}  
\} 32  
Components in Blazor  
4. Before we move to the BookCard component, we just need to add the namespace BooksStore.  
Models to the \_Imports.razor file so we don’t need to add the using statement every  
time we want to reference a model\:  
...  
@using BooksStore.Shared  
@using BooksStore.Services  
@using BooksStore.Models  
5. Open the BookCard.razor file, and let’s modify it to accept a Book object as a parameter  
by adding the @code \{ \} directive and parameter of the type Book. The following code  
snippet shows the result of this step\:  
...  
\<button style="width\:100%"\>Add to Cart\</button\>  
\</div\>  
@code  
\{  
\[Parameter\]  
public Book? Book \{ get; set; \}  
\}  
6. After adding the parameter, we can reference the value of the properties of the Book object  
using the implicit Razor expressions in HTML via @ and the name of the property within the  
parameter object \(we will also use the nullable operator \(?\) just in case the parameter value  
was null\) as the next code snippet shows\:  
\<div style="border\:1px solid black; padding\:3px"\>  
\<h6\>@Book?.Title\</h6\>  
\<p\>Author\: @Book?.AuthorName\</p\>  
\<p\>Publishing date\: @Book?.PublishingDate\</p\>  
\<button style="width\:100%"\>Add to Cart\</button\>  
\</div\>  
...  
7\. The last step is to provide the value of the Book parameter to the component when we call it.  
Go back to the Index.razor file and add a new @code \{\} directive that will include the  
declaration of a new Book object\:  
...  
@if \(!Host.IsDevelopment\(\)\)  
\{  
\<SurveyPrompt Title="How is Blazor working for  
you?" /\>  
\} Moving data among components 33  
@code  
\{  
private Book \_firstBook = new Book  
\{  
AuthorName = "John Smith",  
PublishingDate = new DateTime\(2022, 08,  
01\),  
Title = "Mastering Blazor WebAssembly"  
\};  
\}  
...  
8. Modify the line where it calls the BookCard component by passing the value of the Book  
parameter using an attribute\:  
...  
\<BookCard Book="\_firstBook" /\>  
...  
So, if we run the project right now, we should see the exact same component but with different data  
rendered from the previous one. This data is passed using parameters when calling the component,  
as shown in the following screenshot\:  
Figure 2.3 – Rendered component after passing the parameters  
The same component can now be used just as we have seen all over the application and whenever your  
app needs to show this piece of UI. The Book parameter is used to pass data to be rendered within  
the component, but now we will create another parameter that will control the rendering process and  
the functionality of the component. 34  
Components in Blazor  
The second parameter we will add will be responsible for showing or hiding the Add to Cart button  
as, in some places in the app, we just need to see the info of the book without the need to be able to  
add it to the shopping cart.  
To achieve this behavior, we will create another parameter of the Boolean type called WithButton  
and directly initialize the True value in the BookCard component, as the following code shows\:  
...  
\[Parameter\]  
public bool WithButton \{ get; set; \} = true;  
...  
Now, after creating the parameter, we can wrap the button with an if condition to show it only if the  
value of this button is true, as in the following code snippet\:  
...  
\<p\>Publishing date\: @Book?.PublishingDate\</p\>  
@if \(WithButton\)  
\{  
\<button style="width\:100%"\>Add to Cart\</button\>  
\}  
\</div\>  
...  
Now we are going to call this component one more time in the Index component in the Index.  
razor file, but providing the false value to WithButton\:  
...  
\<BookCard Book="\_firstBook" /\>  
\<BookCard Book="\_firstBook" WithButton="false" /\>  
\<p\>Api Url\: @Configuration\["ApiUrl"\]\</p\>  
...  
You may notice, after running the application one more time, that the book card is present twice, but  
the second one doesn’t contain an Add to Cart button. Moving data among components 35  
Figure 2.4 – Rendering two book cards, the second one without a button  
Parameters – special cases  
Blazor also has some other complementary attributes that provide some additional functionality and  
define some specifications for the parameters of your components. Here are some special cases and  
attributes that you will mostly use while developing your application\:  
•  
\[EditorRequired\] attribute\: If you decorate a Blazor parameter with this attribute, the parameter  
will be required, and the compiler will show some warnings if the value of the parameter is  
not provided.  
We can make our Book parameter required in the BookCard component by adding it as follows\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
\[Parameter\]  
\[EditorRequired\]  
public Book? Book \{ get; set; \}  
\}  
Or it could be added in the same line\:  
\[Parameter, EditorRequired\]  
public Book? Book \{ get; set; \} 36  
Components in Blazor  
•  
Capture arbitrary attributes\: Sometimes you need to pass some attributes to your components  
that are not declared as parameters. This is most likely the case when you want to capture the  
HTML element attributes such as class, style, and so on.  
You can capture those undefined attributes and assign them to an element in your component  
using the @attributes attribute for your HTML tag.  
The value of this attribute is Dictionary\<string, object\>. The key of each dictionary  
element represents the name, and the value of type object represents the value of that  
property.  
Back in our BookCard component, we want to improve our component by adding the ability  
to capture attributes such as style and class, and apply them to the parent div of the card.  
To achieve this, in BookCard.razor, we need to create a parameter called UserAttributes  
of the Dictionary\<string, object\>type, and set the CaptureUnmatchedValues  
= true property for the Parameter attribute, as the following code snippet shows\:  
...  
\[Parameter\(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true\)\]  
public Dictionary\<string, object\>? UserAttributes  
\{ get; set; \}  
...  
Now we can assign the value of this parameter to the @attributes directive in the div  
tag of the card as follows\:  
…  
\<div style ="border\:1px solid black; padding\:5px" @  
attributes="UserAttribues"\>  
\<h6\>@Book?.Title\</h6\>  
...  
Now while calling the component, we can pass attributes such as class and onclick to the  
parent div without defining them as parameters explicitly.  
As you have noticed in the preceding example when we added another BookCard, there is no  
margin between the two cards in the Index component. We will add some margin by adding  
the class attribute and giving it the bootstrap class mt-3, which will add some margin  
from the top as follows\:  
\<BookCard Book="\_firstBook" /\>  
\<BookCard Book="\_firstBook" WithButton="false" class="mt-3"/\> Moving data among components 37  
The class attribute now will be applied to the div wrapper of the card and will add a margin  
at the top\:  
Figure 2.6 – The second book card after adding a margin at the top  
EventCallback  
EventCallback is another smart technique provided by Blazor that allows the child component to  
send data to its parent by assigning a function to the child component that it will call when a certain  
event occurs.  
The actual value of EventCallback is a function that either takes no or one parameter if we use  
the generic version of it \(EventCallback\<T\>\).  
The functions to be used as an EventCallback value should either return void or Task. The  
technique doesn’t support returning other types.  
Tip  
EventCallback is wrapped around the concept of delegates in C\#, with some added  
functionality to handle the updated state of the component.  
A delegate is basically a C\# type and its value represents a function with a predefined signature  
\(return type and parameters\).  
To learn more about delegates, see https\://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/  
csharp/programming-guide/delegates/. 38  
Components in Blazor  
Now we will extend the functionality of the BookCard by adding an EventCallback that takes  
Book as a parameter, and this event will be fired when the user clicks on the Add to Cart button.  
So, in BookCard.razor, to add an event callback with the Book type for its parameter,  
we need to create a Blazor parameter of the EventCallback\<Book\> type, and give it the  
name OnAddToCartClicked\:  
...  
\[Parameter\]  
public EventCallback\<Book?\> OnAddToCartClicked \{ get; set; \}  
The preceding code snippet means the BookCard component can accept a function that returns  
void or Task and takes a parameter of the Book type.  
Now to fire this event, we will create a simple function called AddToCart that will fire the  
EventCallback and pass the book of the card as a parameter\:  
...  
\[Parameter\]  
public EventCallback\<Book?\> OnAddToCartClicked \{ get; set; \}  
private void AddToCart\(\)  
\{  
OnAddToCartClicked.InvokeAsync\(Book\);  
\}  
...  
To fire the AddToCart\(\) function, we need to use the @onclick event for the button that will be  
triggered when we click the Add to Cart button as follows\:  
...  
@if \(WithButton\)  
\{  
\<button style="width\:100%" @onclick="AddToCart"\>  
Add to Cart\</button\>  
\}  
...  
After adding this EventCallback, the BookCard now allows its parents to assign a function that  
takes Book as a parameter. That means when that function in the parent is triggered in BookCard,  
it will pass the Book object from the child to the parent via the parameter of the function, where  
it can do some processing outside the scope of the BookCard component that is responsible for  
rendering the book only. Moving data among components 39  
The next phase requires us to modify Index.razor so it will show a list of books instead of one,  
and when the user clicks Add to Cart, the given title will be added to the user’s cart in the UI using  
the following steps\:  
1. To deal with the books in our project \(retrieve, add, edit, etc.\), we will create a service with its  
interface, register it in the DI container, and then inject it whenever we need to.  
To achieve that, create a new interface called IBooksService in the Services folder and  
add a method inside it called GetAllBooksAsync\:  
using BooksStore.Models;  
namespace BooksStore.Services;  
public interface IBooksService  
\{  
Task\<List\<Book\>\> GetAllBooksAsync\(\);  
\}  
2. Next, also in the Services folder, create a new class with the name LocalBooksService.  
cs. The class will have an implementation for the interface we created in step 1. The  
LocalBooksService class will provide methods to deal with book objects stored in the  
local memory as follows\:  
using BooksStore.Models;  
namespace BooksStore.Services;  
public class LocalBooksService \: IBooksService  
\{  
static List\<Book\> \_allBooks = new List\<Book\>  
\{  
new Book  
\{  
AuthorName = "John Smith",  
PublishingDate = new DateTime\(2021, 01,  
12\),  
Title = "Blazor WebAssembly Guide"  
\},  
new Book  
\{  
AuthorName = "John Smith",  
PublishingDate = new DateTime\(2022, 03,  
13\),  
Title = "Mastering Blazor WebAssembly",  
\},  
new Book  
\{  
AuthorName = "John Smith",  
PublishingDate = new DateTime\(2022, 08, 40  
Components in Blazor  
01\),  
Title = "Learning Blazor from A to Z"  
\}  
\};  
public Task\<List\<Book\>\> GetAllBooksAsync\(\)  
\{  
return Task.FromResult\(\_allBooks\);  
\}  
\}  
3\. 4. The GetAllBooksAsync returns Task\<List\<Book\>\> because later, in Chapter 8,  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly, we will create another implementation for  
IBooksService that will require awaitable calls for an online service to fetch the books  
instead of retrieving them from a static in-memory list.  
To be able to inject IBooksService, we need to register it in the DI container with its  
implementation. So, in Program.cs, you can add the following line\:  
builder.Services.AddScoped\<IBooksService, LocalBooksService\>\(\);  
5. Open the Index.razor file and inject IBooksService using the @inject directive  
at the top\:  
...  
@inject IBooksService BooksService  
6\. In the @code section, create a variable of the List\<Book\>type, override the  
OnInitializedAsync method, and then call GetAllBooksAsync from  
BooksService as follows\:  
...  
private List\<Book\> \_books = new List\<Book\>\(\);  
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
\_books =  
await BooksService.GetAllBooksAsync\(\);  
\}  
...  
7. To show this list of books, we need to iterate over it using a foreach loop and render the  
BookCard component in each iteration. In addition to that, we will create a div wrapper  
with style as display\:flex, so the books will be rendered horizontally\:  
...  
\<BookCard Book="\_firstBook" WithButton="false" class="mt-3" /\>  
\<h3\>Available Books\:\</h3\>  
\<div style="display\:flex"\> 8\. 9. 10. Moving data among components 41  
@foreach \(var book in \_books\)  
\{  
\<BookCard Book="book" /\>  
\}  
\</div\>  
...  
The result of the previous work should be something like this\:  
Figure 2.6 – List of books  
After having the list, we can leverage the OnAddToCartClicked event callback. So, create  
a list of titles in the Index, and every time the user clicks Add to Cart, the title of that book  
gets added to that list and rendered in the UI. In the code, create a List\<Book\> object and  
call it \_booksCart\:  
private List\<Book\> \_booksCart = new List\<Book\>\(\);  
The following is the books list in the UI. We will iterate over \_booksCart and print the title  
of each book in the cart\:  
...  
\<h3 class="mt-3"\>My Cart\</h3\>  
\<ul\>  
@foreach \(var item in \_booksCart\)  
\{  
\<li\>@item.Title\</li\>  
\}  
\</ul\>  
...  
Initially the list will be empty, but in the next step, we will create the functionality to add a book  
to the cart every time the user clicks Add to Cart.  
Now create a new function called AddToCart that takes a Book object as a parameter. This  
function will be passed to the event callback of the BookCard component. The BookCard  
will trigger this function and the book of the card will be passed to this function as a parameter  
so we can process it. Our processing, for now, is adding the book to the cart list\:  
private void AddToCart\(Book selectedBook\)  
\{ 42  
Components in Blazor  
\_booksCart.Add\(selectedBook\);  
\}  
11. The last step is just assigning the AddToCart function to the OnAddToCartClicked  
event callback of the BookCard component as follows\:  
\<div style="display\:flex" \>  
@foreach \(var book in \_books\)  
\{  
\<BookCard Book="book"  
OnAddToCartClicked="AddToCart" /\>  
\}  
\</div\>  
Please note that when you assign the function, don’t use the parentheses as in AddToCart\(\),  
because here we are not calling the function. Instead, we are assigning it just like any other  
variable.  
Now, after running the project and clicking on the Add to Cart button below a book in the Available  
Books list, you will notice that the title of the book will be added to the My Cart list\:  
Figure 2.7 – Cart list after clicking on Add to Cart  
The power of EventCallback, which allows the child component to call a function from the parent  
component and pass data for it, gives us a very flexible way to communicate while keeping the code  
separated and clean.  
Cascading values and parameters  
Cascading values and parameters comprise another way to make data flow from the parent components  
to their children. However, the difference between cascading parameters and normal component  
parameters is that cascading parameters pass the data to any number of descendent components in Moving data among components 43  
the hierarchy. Unlike the component parameters, cascading values and parameters don’t need an  
assignment through the attribute; their values are populated automatically.  
And because the cascading values can go down in the hierarchy of the components, any child component  
can access a cascading value from a parent component despite the number of levels between them.  
The following code snippet is a basic setup for the cascading value\:  
\<CascadingValue Value="\_cardStyle"\>  
\<BookCard Book="\_firstBook" /\>  
\</CascadingValue\>  
To start using the cascading values and parameters, we first have the CascadingValue component  
that allows us to set a cascading value in a parent component, and the \[CascadingParameter\]  
attribute is to make use of the cascading value provided by an ancestor component.  
In the following example, we are going to use the MainLayout file in the Shared folder to add a  
cascading value component that wraps the @Body property, which holds all the child components  
within the layout. \(More about layouts will be covered in Chapter 3, Developing Advanced Components  
in Blazor.\) The cascading value will be a basic string variable that represents the major style of the  
background for the interested child components. And that will unify the background style for all the  
cards that we will have\:  
1. Open the MainLayout.razor file in the Shared folder, create a string variable called  
\_backgroundStyle, and initialize it with a basic style\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
private string \_backroundStyle =  
"background-color\:\#f2f2f2";  
\}  
2. Within the article HTML tag, wrap the @Body property render with the CascadingValue  
component and assign the Value property to @\_backgroundStyle\:  
...  
\<article class="content px-4"\>  
\<CascadingValue Value="@\_backroundStyle"\>  
@Body  
\</CascadingValue\>  
\</article\>  
...  
Now all child components have access to a cascading parameter of type string that holds the  
basic style for the background and could be used by any component within the hierarchy. 44  
Components in Blazor  
3. Back in the BookCard component, we need to make use of the value provided by the parent  
component, which is MainLayout. To access that value, you need to add a C\# property of  
type string and decorate it with the \[CascadingParameter\] attribute as follows\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
\[CascadingParameter\]  
public string? BackgroundStyle \{ get; set; \}  
...  
4. Now, the value from the main layout will automatically be populated in the BackgroundStyle  
parameter, so we can append it to the div’s style attribute as follows\:  
\<div style="border\:1px solid black; padding\:3px;@  
BackgroundStyle" @attributes="UserAttributes"\>  
\<h6\>@Book?.Title\</h6\>  
...  
Now after running the project, note that all the BookCard components on the Index page have  
the same background color, and changing the value in MainLayout will update all components  
using this value.  
Figure 2.8 – Unified background style for all the BookCard components in the UI Moving data among components 45  
IsFixed parameter for cascading values  
The CascadingValue component has an optional parameter called IsFixed of bool type; its  
value is false by default. IsFixed instructs the recipient components of the cascading value to either  
subscribe to the value change or not.  
It’s recommended, when possible, to set its value to true, as that will lead to no subscriptions receiving  
updates about cascading value changes, resulting in better performance, especially when there are a  
large number of recipients for the value.  
You can set the IsFixed parameter as follows\:  
\<CascadingValue IsFixed="true" Value="this"\>  
\<ChildComponent /\>  
\</CascadingValue\>  
Multiple cascading values and parameters  
As you have seen in the preceding example, we could use the cascading value because it was the only  
type string available.  
To be able to add multiple cascading values, you need to either have multiple values with multiple  
types \(string value, int value, Book value, etc.\), or the same value but defined with the name of the  
value explicitly\:  
•  
Multiple values with different types\: The following examples in the MainLayout component  
show how we can declare more than one cascading value of different types \(string and bool  
in the following example\)\:  
...  
\<article class="content px-4"\>  
\<CascadingValue Value="@\_backroundStyle"\>  
\<CascadingValue Value="@\_isBusy"\>  
@Body  
\</CascadingValue\>  
\</CascadingValue\>  
\</article\>  
\</main\>  
\</div\>  
@code  
\{  
...  
private bool \_isBusy = false;  
\} 46  
Components in Blazor  
Now, we have two cascading values available in any child component to access by defining their  
cascading parameters. One is of type bool and the other is of type string as follows\:  
\[CascadingParameter\]  
public string? BackgroundStyle \{ get; set; \}  
\[CascadingParameter\]  
public bool IsBusy \{ get; set; \}  
•  
Multiple values with explicit names\: If you have multiple cascading values with the same  
types, you can define the name of the value explicitly using the Name parameter, as shown in  
the following example\:  
\<article class="content px-4"\>  
\<CascadingValue Value="@\_backroundStyle"  
Name="BackgroundStyle"\>  
\<CascadingValue Value="@\_buttonStyle"  
Name="ButtonStyle"\>  
@Body  
\</CascadingValue\>  
\</CascadingValue\>  
...  
@code  
\{  
private string \_backroundStyle =  
"background-color\:\#f2f2f2";  
private string \_buttonStyle =  
"background-color\:orange";  
Now, when referencing one of those cascading values in the child components, we need to  
define the name using the Name property of the \[CascadingParameter\] attribute as  
shown in the BookCard component\:  
\[CascadingParameter\(Name = "BackgroundStyle"\)\]  
public string? BackgroundStyle \{ get; set; \}  
\[CascadingParameter\(Name = "ButtonStyle"\)\]  
public string? ButtonStyle \{ get; set; \}  
With that, we have discovered three different ways to enable communication between our application  
components\: parameters, cascading parameters, and event callbacks. Moving data among components 47  
Two-way data binding in Blazor  
Now we know that we can use parameters to pass data from a parent to its children, and event callbacks  
to pass data from the child to the parent. Next, we will learn about combining them together.  
Blazor provides a neat and compact way to enable two-way data passing between components. Let’s  
take a Table component that renders a collection of data as an example. The Table component  
allows the user to select an item when clicking on any row. Basically, in the Table component, we  
need a parameter called SelectedItem and an EventCallback called OnSelectedItem  
that will enable us to pass an already selected item to the table. The EventCallback will also let  
us receive the new selected item when the user picks it.  
To get the update from the child component, we need to create a method and assign it to the  
EventCallback parameter of the component. This method will accept the passed value from the  
parameter, and then assign it to a variable in the very basic shape if there is no processing required.  
To send the value of that variable to the component, we need to pass it to the Parameter. With the  
@bind directive, we can combine both operations and skip the method that will update the variable  
in a single attribute.  
To be able to use the @bind with a component, it has to have a parameter of a certain type and  
EventCallback of the same parameter type. The EventCallback must have the same name  
as the parameter concatenated with the word Changed, as the following example shows\:  
\[Parameter\]  
public string? Message \{ get; set; \}  
\[Parameter\]  
public EventCallback\<string?\> MessageChanged \{ get; set; \}  
That component accepts a parameter of type string, and it also updates the value of that string  
internally and it exposes an EventCallback that could be triggered when that value gets changed.  
So, when we use this component in another parent component that has a variable of type string called  
\_message, this variable will be passed to the child component, and we also need to update it when  
the child updates its value internally, so let’s use @bind as follows\:  
\<ChildComponent @bind-Message="\_message" /\>  
In Chapter 3, Developing Advanced Components in Blazor, we will use the two-way data binding while  
developing a component; also in Chapter 5, Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation, while  
using the input components, we will use it heavily and learn more about its advanced techniques.  
In the next section, we will discover the life cycle of the component within the Blazor app, and each  
stage the component goes through over its lifetime. 48  
Components in Blazor  
# Discovering the component life cycle  
Blazor components go through a set of methods from initialization to rendering and finally being  
disposed of. These methods have synchronous and asynchronous versions that we can leverage to  
perform certain tasks.  
The following list shows the methods that the components go through; not all of them are being called.  
Being called depends on whether the component is being rendered for the first time\:  
•  
SetParameterAsync\: This sets the value of the parameters from the component parent and  
the route parameters. \(More about route parameters will be covered in Chapter 4, Navigation  
and Routing.\)  
The default implementation of this method sets the values of the parameters and the cascading  
parameters available. SetParameterAsync is called only for the first render of the component.  
Overriding its implementation allows you to control the process of setting the values of the  
parameters and write some logic based on that, as shown in the BookCard.razor file\:  
// Override the SetParametersAsync to control the  
// process of setting the parameters  
// using the ParameterView object that holds the  
// values of the component parameters  
public override async Task SetParametersAsync\(ParameterView  
parameters\)  
\{  
if \(parameters.TryGetValue\<string\>\(nameof\(BackgroundStyle\),  
out var value\)\)  
\{  
if \(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace\(value\)\)  
\{  
BackgroundStyle = "background-color\:white";  
\}  
\}  
await base.SetParametersAsync\(parameters\);  
\}  
•  
OnInitialized / OnInitializedAsync\: After the component receives its parameter  
values, OnInitialized for synchronous operations and OnInitializedAsync for  
asynchronous operations are invoked, only for the first-time render. •  
•  
Discovering the component life cycle 49  
Overriding the implementation of OnInitialized or OnInitializedAsync allows  
us to take some actions and execute logic when the components get initialized, for example,  
to start fetching data from the API \(more on this in Chapter 8, Consuming Web APIs from  
Blazor WebAssembly\)\:  
protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
// Fetch data from the API  
\}  
OnParameterSet / OnParameterSetAsync\: These two methods get called after  
OnInitialized and OnInitializedAsync in the first render, as well as after one or  
more parameter values get changed by the parent component.  
To validate or do some logic when any value of a parameter gets changed, you need to override  
either OnParameterSet or OnParameterSetAsync for asynchronous logic\:  
// Validate the Book parameter and throws an exception  
// if it's null  
protected override void OnParametersSet\(\)  
\{  
if \(Book == null\)  
throw new ArgumentNullException\(nameof\(Book\)\);  
\}  
OnAfterRender / OnAfterRenderAsync\: These methods are called after the component  
rendering has finished, and any changes here won’t be rendered unless you explicitly use the  
StateHasChanged\(\) method. In this stage, all the elements and the component references  
are fully rendered.  
OnAfterRender and OnAfterRenderAsync has a Boolean parameter that determines  
whether this is the first render of the component or not. As these methods get called after the  
rendering process for the component, the process may comprise the first render or a subsequent  
one. Overriding those methods is perfect for making JS calls against the DOM \(more on this in  
Chapter 6, Consuming JavaScript in Blazor\), as the DOM elements are rendered and available\:  
protected async override Task OnAfterRenderAsync\(bool  
firstRender\)  
\{  
// Make a JavaScript call to manipulate the DOM  
// elements  
\} 50  
Components in Blazor  
The following diagram shows the flow of the component life cycle\:  
Figure 2.9 – Component lifetime stages  
Tip  
If the asynchronous task executed in the life cycle events is not completed, the component will  
continue to be rendered. When the task gets completed, the component will be rendered to  
reflect the updates in the UI if there are any. Styling the components using CSS 51  
Dispose event  
One extra set of life cycle events comprises the Dispose and DisposeAsync methods by  
implementing either the IDisposable interface for synchronous disposal or IAsyncDisposable  
for asynchronous disposal. Disposal will occur when the component is removed from the UI and  
helps to clear up unmanaged resources such as files and events.  
The following example shows how to implement the Dispose method\:  
@implements IDisposable  
...  
@code \{  
public void Dispose\(\)  
\{  
// Release unmanaged resources like unsubscribe from  
// events  
// Timer.Dispose\(\);  
\}  
...  
\}  
Tip  
You need to implement either IDisposable or IAsyncDisposable as the framework  
will call the asynchronous version if both are available.  
In this section, we have learned about the life cycle events that each Blazor component has. These  
events are used heavily in each application and throughout the projects in this book.  
Now, after creating a full Blazor component and populating it with some data, it’s time to make it  
pretty by adding some CSS for it.  
# Styling the components using CSS  
CSS is a web utility that allows us to change the look and feel of our elements. In this section, we will deep  
dive into the different ways supported by Blazor with which we can add CSS styles to our components.  
In Blazor apps, we have four different ways to style our components\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Global styles  
Isolated styles \(scoped\)  
Inline styles  
Embedded styles 52  
Components in Blazor  
Isolated styles  
Blazor provides us with a powerful way to style our components by keeping the styles separated from  
each other. This means small, clean styles, scoped for each component.  
To reference the isolated styles, you need to add a link tag with a reference using the  
syntax \{AssemblyName\}.styles.css.  
Let’s get started using isolated styles to style our BookCard component\:  
1. Create a CSS file in the same folder of the BookCard component following the convention  
\{ComponentName\}.razor.css – in our case, BookCard.razor.css. This will make  
Visual Studio create a nested file behind the component file as follows\:  
Figure 2.10 – Nested CSS file by Visual Studio  
All the styles within BookCard.razor.css will be scoped for the BookCard component  
2\. only.  
Let’s add some CSS styles to make the book’s card looks prettier. We are going to have two  
classes\: one for the button and another for div with margin, padding, a little shadow, and  
some smooth borders for a modern feel\:  
.card \{  
margin\: 7px;  
padding\: 7px;  
box-shadow\: 0px 3px 8px -3px rgb\(0 0 0 / 75%\);  
border-radius\: 3px;  
\}  
.main-button \{  
background-color\: \#ec6611;  
border-radius\: 3px;  
border\: none; Styling the components using CSS 53  
color\: white;  
width\: 100%;  
padding\: 4px;  
margin\: 4px;  
font-size\: 13px;  
cursor\: pointer;  
\}  
3. Back in the BookCard.razor file, we can now apply those classes to the div and button  
elements and we can remove the inline styles we set earlier\:  
\<div style="@BackgroundStyle" @attributes="UserAttributes"  
class="card"\>  
\<h6\>@Book?.Title\</h6\>  
...  
@if \(WithButton\)  
\{  
\<button class="main-button"  
@onclick="AddToCart"\>Add to Cart\</button\>  
\}  
...  
Now when we run the project, we will see that our card has a much better visual appeal than before.  
The result should be like the following screenshot\:  
Figure 2.11 – The look of the BookCard after adding CSS 54  
Components in Blazor  
The powerful part of this CSS is that the class names \(card and main-button\) are only scoped  
for the BookCard component and cannot affect other components. The concept of isolation here  
gives us clean and short CSS files, in addition to having the styles of each component alongside the  
respective component file.  
So, now the question is\: how does isolated CSS work?  
After running the project, open the developer tools and look at the generated HTML and CSS. Note  
that Blazor has appended an HTML attribute in the format b-\{10-characters-text\}. The  
following screenshot shows the div element of the card\:  
Figure 2.12 – The HTML attribute appended to the div element by Blazor  
And looking at the following CSS window, we can also see that the card class has been renamed,  
with the same identifier appended as follows\:  
Figure 2.13 – The updated CSS class name with the identifier  
In essence, the CSS isolation happens at build time when Blazor rewrites all the CSS selectors to  
target the HTML elements with the unique identifier. Then, it combines them in a static CSS file with  
a name using the syntax \{AssemblyName\}.styles.css. If you view your project in the CSS  
window of the browser Dev Tools, you will see the name of the CSS files that contain classes, such  
as BooksStore.styles.css\:  
Figure 2.14 – Name of the CSS file that contains the isolated CSS selectors Styling the components using CSS 55  
And that’s why if we open the Index.html file, we see that Blazor references the BooksStore.  
styles.css file, as this file gets generated at the build time and is available in the root folder\:  
\<html lang="en"\>  
\<head\>  
...  
\<link href="BooksStore.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" /\>  
\</head\>  
...  
Note  
Isolated CSS will be applied only to the scoped component. You can use the \:\:deep pseudo-  
element, for example, .card\:\:deep, so that styles will be applied to descendent elements  
in the child components.  
Global styles  
Global styles use a .css file for the application referenced in the Index.html file, like the default  
app.css file found in the wwwroot/css folder. By default, that file has the styles for the default  
Blazor template. You can use this file to set general styles that will be used across your application,  
such as text styles.  
Inline styles  
Inline styles are created when you set the CSS styles directly in the element within the component  
using the style attribute. This method is efficient as no cache issues will be faced.  
However, this will lead to a long element written in the components, and the styles applied to the  
element cannot be reused because they are not wrapped with a class.  
The benefit of using the inline styles is to have more control over the CSS properties based on a certain  
logic in your component, for example, changing the color of the text if a book is being sold at a discount.  
Tip  
When working with inline styles, especially those managed by specific behavior, it’s recommended  
to use the third-party BlazorComponentUtilities package, which contains the  
StyleBuilder class, and helps us write inline styles using C\# in a very clean and manageable  
way. You can download the package from https\://www.nuget.org/packages/  
BlazorComponentUtilities/. 56  
Components in Blazor  
Embedded styles  
Embedded styles can be created by using the \<style\> tag within your component, and will override  
other styles. However, this approach is not recommended because it will lead to repeating the styles  
every time the component gets rendered or shown in the UI.  
The following example shows how you can use embedded styles in your component\:  
...  
\<style\>  
.main-button\:hover \{  
background-color\: \#c7540c  
\}  
\</style\>  
...  
The embedded-styles approach is useful if you are using a Blazor UI framework and you want to  
override some of the default styles it has. To do this, open the Dev Tools in the browser and discover  
the class names. Then, with the \<style\> tag, you can override those classes with your own properties.  
Tip  
Using CSS preprocessors improves CSS development by using features such as variables, loops,  
and inheritance. However, Blazor doesn’t have native support for CSS preprocessors such as  
Sass or Less, but this can be achieved through some third-party packages and extensions such  
as Web Compiler for Visual Studio. You can learn more about this at https\://github.  
com/madskristensen/WebCompiler.  
Now we have learned how we can add and manage the CSS of our project and examined the four  
different techniques available. Much of the time throughout this book, we will be working with isolated  
styles and inline styles, so this will be very useful.  
# Summary  
Throughout this chapter, we have discovered various aspects of Blazor components, including how  
to create them using Razor syntax. We have also written our first component and learned how we  
can pass data between our components from parents to children and vice versa using parameters,  
cascading parameters, and EventCallbacks.  
We also understood the life cycle events of each Blazor component, which are helpful to execute some  
logic in certain stages in the component’s lifetime. Finally, we walked through the available ways to  
write our project’s CSS, and saw how Blazor handles things behind the scenes for isolated CSS. Further reading 57  
By now, you should be able to do the following\:  
•  
Create and use a Blazor component  
•  
•  
Pass data between components and across the components hierarchy  
Leverage the component life cycle events and react to certain changes within the component  
lifetime in the app  
•  
Style your components and learn the different ways to deal with CSS in your Blazor app  
In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into the concept of components, examining some special  
types such as layout components and templated components. We wil also learn how we render  
components dynamically in the UI, and consider the data binding mechanism for efficient two-way  
data communication between components.

# Components in Blazor  
In this chapter, we are going to dive deeper into the concept of components by learning about layouts,  
which define the general shape and the common components of the app pages and how to pass user  
interfaces \(UIs\) and other components as parameters using templated components. We will apply  
these concepts by creating our first layout and templated component. We will also see how we can  
render components in the UI dynamically using the Dynamic Component technique and learn how  
to create the Razor Class Library project and package or reuse our components in different projects.  
This chapter will provide you with the required knowledge to develop more advanced components,  
in addition to grouping them in a Razor Class Library for future reusability.

Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
# Building layouts in Blazor  
Most applications have common pieces of UI shared across different pages such as menus, navbars,  
company branding, and some other content. Rewriting this markup in every page component is very  
inefficient in modern software development. The solution is to have a single place where we place  
this shared content and then reference it from the pages, and here is where layout comes into play.  
So basically, a layout is a special type of Blazor component that defines the general structure of the  
app by hosting the shared markup.  
Understanding our Blazor project’s default MainLayout  
Before getting started with creating our own layout component, let’s understand the default layout  
that comes with a Blazor project. The MainLayout.razor file within the Shared folder is the  
default layout for every new Blazor project, so if we open that file, we are going to notice the following\:  
@inherits LayoutComponentBase  
\<div class="page"\>  
\<div class="sidebar"\>  
\<NavMenu /\>  
\</div\>  
\<main\>  
\<div class="top-row px-4"\>  
\<a href=https\://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/  
target="\_blank"\>About\</a\>  
\</div\>  
\<article class="content px-4"\>  
@Body  
\</article\>  
\</main\>  
\</div\>  
As you may notice in the preceding code, the first special thing about the layout components is that  
they have the LayoutComponentBase base type, which contains @Body – this renders the  
routable components of the app \(Index, Counter, FetchData, and so on\).  
The default MainLayout defines the NavMenu component with the \<sidebar\> element, a top  
bar with an about button, and an \<article\> element, which contains the main content of the app. Building layouts in Blazor 61  
Creating our first layout component  
In our BooksStore application, we need to have two different layouts\: the default one will be used  
for the admin pages, and a new one that is simpler and cleaner will serve the users, as shown in the  
following screenshot\:  
Figure 3.1 – The Index page with a new layout  
So, let’s create the new UserLayout and use it in our components in the following steps\:  
1. Before we create the layout itself, we need to create the new NavBar component at the top. So  
in the Shared folder, create a new component called NavBar and use the following code for it\:  
\<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"\>  
\<div class="container-fluid"\>  
\<a class="navbar-brand" href=""\>BooksStore\</a\>  
\<button class="navbar-toggler" type="button"  
data-bs-toggle="collapse"  
data-bs-target="\#navbarNav"  
aria-controls="navbarNav"  
aria-expanded="false"  
aria-label="Toggle navigation"\>  
\<span class="navbar-toggler-icon"\>\</span\>  
\</button\>  
\<div class="collapse navbar-collapse"  
id="navbarNav"\>  
\<ul class="navbar-nav"\>  
\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<a class="nav-link active" 62  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
aria-current="page"  
href=""\>Home\</a\>  
\</li\>  
\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<a class="nav-link"  
href="/Counter"\>Counter\</a\>  
\</li\>  
\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<a class="nav-link"  
href="/FetchData"\>Fetch Data  
\</a\>  
\</li\>  
\</ul\>  
\</div\>  
\</div\>  
\</nav\>  
2\. 3. Create a new Razor component in the Shared folder as well and give it the name UserLayout  
\(you can place the component in another folder as well, but the Shared folder is convenient  
for housing shared components in our app\).  
Set the base class of UserLayout by inheriting from LayoutComponentBase, as every  
layout should have this as its base type\:  
@inherits LayoutComponentBase  
4\. Render the new NavBar component at the top of the layout\:  
...  
\<NavBar /\>  
5. Create a \<main\> element and give it some padding and render the @Body property within it\:  
...  
\<main class="px-5 py-4"\>  
@Body  
\</main\>  
So, the full code of the new simple layout should look as follows\:  
@inherits LayoutComponentBase  
\<NavBar /\>  
\<main class="px-5 py-4"\>  
@Body  
\</main\>  
Now, we are ready to start using this Layout in our components. Building layouts in Blazor 63  
Defining the layout for a component  
Blazor provides us with different ways to set the layout of our components, including applying the  
layout to a certain component, a group of components, or all the components of the app\:  
•  
Applying the default layout\: The default layout of the project is defined within the App.razor  
file, as you can see in the following code\:  
...  
\<Found Context="routeData"\>  
\<RouteView RouteData="@routeData"  
DefaultLayout="@typeof\(MainLayout\)" /\>  
...  
•  
The RouteView component has the DefaultLayout parameter, which we can use to set  
the type of the default layout that will be used for all application components.  
Applying a layout to a folder of components\: We can define the layout of all the components  
existing in a certain folder. As we mentioned in Chapter 1, Understanding the Anatomy of  
a Blazor WebAssembly Project, we used the \_Imports.razor file to define shared used  
namespaces for all the components. The \_Imports.razor file can be created in each folder  
or in a specific one, and we can use it to define the layout for all the components within that  
folder using the @layout directive. In our example, we will create a new folder inside the  
Pages folder and call it UserPages. We will place the pages that will be accessed by the  
public users and not the admins within it, and then we will move Index.razor inside the  
UserPages folder as well\:  
Figure 3.2 – The Index.razor component inside the UserPages folder 64  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
Now, to set the layout of the Index component and all future components within this folder,  
we will create an \_Imports.razor file in the UserPages folder and then set the layout  
to the UserLayout that we created in the previous section as follows\:  
@layout UserLayout  
•  
Now, if we run the application, you are going to see the Index page with the same layout as in  
Figure 3.1. However, if you navigate to /Count, you will notice the Counter page within the  
default Blazor layout with the purple nav menu on the left.  
Applying a layout to a single component\: In some cases, only a certain page or pages need different  
components, but they are not grouped in a folder. Imagine a scenario where an application has  
the Login/Register pages in a blank layout that doesn’t have a nav menu. In such a scenario,  
you can set the Login page layout specifically using the same @layout directive but at the  
level of the component.  
In the following example, we are going to change the layout of the FetchData page in the  
FetchData.razor file, and set it to use UserLayout but at the level of the component\:  
@page "/fetchdata"  
@inject HttpClient Http  
@inject ILoggingService LoggingService  
@layout UserLayout  
\<PageTitle\>Weather forecast\</PageTitle\>  
...  
After running the application and navigating to /fetch-data, you will notice that the  
FetchData component is wrapped with the new layout created for public users\:  
Figure 3.3 – The FetchData component using UserLayout Developing templated components 65  
•  
Applying a layout to a portion of a component\: Blazor provides us with a special component called  
LayoutView that sets the layout for its children only and can be used inside any component.  
The default usage of LayoutView is in the Router component within App.razor. Basically,  
if we try to navigate to an undefined URL, the Blazor app will render the NotFound component  
section in App.razor, and by default, Blazor will set the layout of the NotFound content  
using the LayoutView component. The following code shows the usage of LayoutView  
to set MainLayout to the application’s NotFound content\:  
\<Router AppAssembly="@typeof\(App\).Assembly"\>  
...  
\<NotFound\>  
...  
\<LayoutView Layout="@typeof\(MainLayout\)"\>  
\<p role="alert"\>  
Sorry, there's nothing at this address.  
\</p\>  
\</LayoutView\>  
\</NotFound\>  
\</Router\>  
Nested layouts  
Layouts can be nested within each other by defining the layout of a layout the same way we  
define the layout of a component.  
An example of using nested layouts could be an application having nested menus. In an  
application with many sections, each section would have its own menu, and the app as a whole  
would have a menu as well. In such a case, we can actually define a default layout for the app,  
and a different layout for each section that references the main layout of the app.  
To learn more about this, read https\://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/  
core/blazor/components/layouts?view=aspnetcore-7.0\#nested-layouts.  
In this section, we learned about Blazor’s default layout, creating new layouts, and applying layouts  
partially, to single pages, or to sets of components. Now, we can move to the next enjoyable section  
of Blazor, which is about templated components that are more flexible and customizable compared  
to other standard components.  
# Developing templated components  
We have seen how we can create a component and pass some data to it so it renders them in a specific  
way; however, what if we want to pass a piece of the UI to that component and inject some markup into  
it? We call these types of components that take UI elements as parameters templated components. 66  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
In templated components, we can receive the UI content to be rendered in a normal parameter, but  
it’s of the RenderFragment or RenderFragment\<Tvalue\> types. Each component can have  
one or multiple RenderFragment parameters.  
In this section, we will learn about developing templated components practically by creating two  
different components that we will use for our project in this book, and which can be used in your  
other projects as well.  
Developing a modal pop-up component  
A modal popup is a popular component, as it is the topmost element we see in modern apps. The  
component allows the user to view further details \(for example, for a product on sale\), fill out a form,  
or take some actions quickly by showing a box in the middle of the screen and disables clicking  
anywhere else outside it. Such popups help the user stay on the same page without needing to navigate  
and keep the required task simple.  
Our modal pop-up component will be templated because we will just develop the modal as a high-  
level component. The content of the modal, whatever it is \(a form, details, a question, and so on\),  
will be passed as a RenderFragment parameter. Basically, we can think of this component as a  
template we can reuse based on our needs. The final result of our example will look like the following\:  
Figure 3.4 – ModalPopup templated component shows a welcome message  
So, let’s get started\:  
1\. 2. In the Shared folder, add a new Razor component and call it ModalPopup.razor.  
For the CSS file associated with this component, we need to create it in a scoped style, as mentioned  
in Chapter 2, Components in Blazor. To do so, we must create a file named ModalPopup. Developing templated components 67  
razor.css. After creating the Razor component and the CSS files, you should have the  
following result\:  
3. Figure 3.5 – Files structure of the ModalPopup within the Shared folder  
In the ModalPopup.razor file, let’s create five parameters\: Title of a string type,  
ChildContent of a RenderFragment type, FooterContent of a RenderFragment  
type, and IsOpen of a bool type. Title will be used as a title for our modal, ChildContent  
will be the UI markup that we will pass when we use the modal, and FooterContent will  
comprise another UI markup to render the bottom part of our modal. With those parameters  
and with the avoidance of a fixed UI, the modal will be usable for every case needed, instead  
of needing to create a new modal for every possible usage.  
We will also need an EventCallback parameter called OnCloseClicked to use to  
notify the parent of the modal when the close button gets clicked, and finally, the IsOpen  
parameter to show or close our modal from the parent component by assigning the value of  
this parameter as true or false\:  
@code  
\{  
\[Parameter\]  
public string? Title \{ get; set; \}  
\[Parameter\]  
public RenderFragment? ChildContent \{ get; set; \}  
\[Parameter\]  
public RenderFragment? FooterContent \{ get; set; \}  
\[Parameter\]  
public bool IsOpen \{ get; set; \}  
\[Parameter\]  
public EventCallback OnCloseClicked \{ get; set; \}  
\} 68  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
4. Now, let’s design the UI of this modal; when the popup opens, there will be an overlay layer  
in the background and the modal box in the middle of the screen. The box will be divided  
into three parts\: header, body, and footer. The header will host the title and a close  
button, the body will render the ChildContent parameter, and the footer will render  
the FooterContent parameter. Of course, all this UI will be rendered only if the modal is  
open, so we will have the following markup\:  
@if \(IsOpen\)  
\{  
\<div class="overlay"\>  
\<div class="modal-box"\>  
\<div class="modal-header"\>  
\<h4\>@Title\</h4\>  
\<span class="close-button"\>X\</span\>  
\</div\>  
\<div class="modal-body"\>  
@ChildContent  
\</div\>  
\<div class="modal-footer"\>  
@FooterContent  
\</div\>  
\</div\>  
\</div\>  
\}  
@code  
\{  
...  
5\. The ChildContent and FooterContent parameter values will comprise markup code,  
so the ModalPopup.razor component doesn’t have a fixed look; every time we use it, we  
need to pass the body and the footer, and that’s what makes it a templated component.  
Unlike BookCard, which we created in Chapter 2, and has a fixed shape and look and just  
received a book object to render it a certain way, our modal popup can be used anytime with  
different content. Its main function is to provide us with a pop-up capability that we need to  
wrap our content with.  
Before we move to the styling part, we just need to activate the close button, so it closes the  
modal when the user clicks it and fires OnCloseClicked EventCallback to notify the  
component that holds the modal that it got closed from inside it. 6\. 7. Developing templated components 69  
To achieve the desired result, we just need to write a small function that sets the value of  
IsOpen to false, as shown in the following code\:  
...  
private void CloseModal\(\)  
\{  
IsOpen = false;  
OnCloseClicked.InvokeAsync\(\);  
\}  
And in the span element, we need to set the value of the @onclick event to the CloseModal  
method\:  
\<span class="close-button" @onclick="CloseModal"\>X\</span\>  
By writing the previous markup, we just need to write the required styles for the classes mentioned  
in the HTML code. So, back in the ModalPopup.razor.css file, let’s add the following  
class for the overlay layer in the background, which is basically what gives the .overlay div  
a fixed position, covers the full page, and gives it a black background with 50% opacity\:  
.overlay \{  
position\: fixed; /\* Set its position based on the  
screen \*/  
width\: 100%; /\* Set the width to the full screen  
width \*/  
height\: 100%; /\* Set the height to the full screen  
height \*/  
top\: 0; /\* Set its top starting point to 0 \*/  
left\: 0; /\* Set its left starting point to 0 \*/  
background-color\: rgba\(0,0,0,0.5\); /\* Black  
background with opacity \*/  
display\: flex; /\* Define the overlay as flex  
container to host the modal box \*/  
justify-content\: center; /\* Set the children of  
the overlay horizontally in the center \*/  
align-items\: center; /\* Set the children of the  
overlay vertically in the center \*/  
\}  
Add the styles of the .modal-box div, which will show in the center because of the flex  
container of its parent \(the .overlay div\). We will create a white background, a little shadow,  
and some smoothness on the borders as follows\:  
...  
.modal-box \{  
width\: 400px; /\* Give it a width, this can be set  
as parameter \*/ 70  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
background-color\: white; /\* Give it a white  
background \*/  
border-radius\: 10px; /\* Set the radius of the  
corners \*/  
box-shadow\: 0 3px 7px rgba\(0, 0, 0, 0.3\);  
/\* Little shadow \*/  
\}  
8. After defining the style of the full box, it’s time to style the parts of its content, and we will  
start with the header. The goal is to set the title on the very left and the X button on the very  
right. We can also achieve this using flex and setting the justify-content property to  
space-between as follows\:  
...  
.modal-box .modal-header \{  
display\: flex; /\* Set the header as a flex  
container \*/  
align-items\: center; /\* Align the title and  
the close button vertically in the center \*/  
justify-content\: space-between; /\* Set the  
title and the close button on each side of the  
header \*/  
padding\: 5px 20px; /\* Set a little padding to  
look a bit better \*/  
\}  
9. Within the header, we need to style the X button a little bit by setting the color of X to red and  
setting Set the cursor to pointer, so it gives feedback that this is a clickable element\:  
...  
.modal-box .modal-header .close-button \{  
color\: red; /\* Set the color of the font to  
red \*/  
cursor\: pointer; /\* Set the cursor to pointer  
to indicate that this is clickable \*/  
\}  
10. Finally, set the styles of the body and the footer content of the modal. We only need  
padding; the rest of the content will be defined when we set its body using the modal in  
another component\:  
...  
.modal-box .modal-body,.modal-footer \{  
padding\: 5px 20px;  
\} Developing templated components 71  
Our modal component is now ready to be used to render special content in a modal popup. Now, we  
will consume it and see the power of the templated components by using the same components with  
different content each time.  
Consuming the modal pop-up component  
Our modal component is currently serving the purpose of a modal box, which shows in the middle  
of the screen and can be populated with anything we want.  
To keep things simple, we are going to create a little welcome message that will be shown to our users  
every time they open the Index page, with a button at the bottom of the dialog to close it.  
When using a templated component, the values of the RenderFragment parameters can be assigned  
by opening two tags with the name of the parameter within the component tag and then typing the  
required markup inside it. The next example will show you how to populate the ChildContent  
parameter and the FooterContent parameter for the dialog that we have created\:  
1. In the Index.razor file, we will render the ModalPopup component and set a P tag in  
the body with a welcome message and a button in the footer to close it. The following code  
snippet could be added to the end of the Razor code on the Index page\:  
...  
\<ModalPopup Title="Hi!"\>  
\<ChildContent\>  
\<p\>Welcome to our Books Store, here you will  
find a huge collection of books to help you  
build you career in software development,  
enjoy it!\</p\>  
\</ChildContent\>  
\<FooterContent\>  
\<button class="btn btn-primary"\>Discover It  
\</button\>  
\</FooterContent\>  
\</ModalPopup\>  
As you may notice, we supplied the Title parameter’s value as an attribute, and for the value  
of the ChildContent and FooterContent parameters, we had to open two tags and set  
the elements inside. This is what makes modal components very interesting, as with them, you  
can inject any UI element or other components inside, and they will be rendered within this  
component \(ModalPopup in our example\). 72  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
2\. Next, we need a variable to control the IsOpen parameter, which is responsible for opening  
and closing our modal popup. Basically, we are going to create a simple variable of a bool type  
and assign it to true, as we want the modal to be open by default. So, in the @code section,  
let us declare the variable and call it \_isWelcomeModalOpen\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
private bool \_isWelcomeModalOpen = true;  
...  
3. Back in our modal component, we need to assign the value of the \_isWelcomeModalOpen  
variable to the IsOpen parameter of the ModalPopup component. So, whenever we change  
the value of the variable, the status of the modal will also be affected\:  
...  
\<ModalPopup Title="Hi!" IsOpen="@\_isWelcomeModalOpen"\>  
\<ChildContent\>  
...  
4. There are two ways to close this modal\: one through the X button built-in within ModalPopup  
itself, and the other is through the Discover it button, wich we have in the footer of the modal  
\(see Figure 3.4\).  
When the user clicks the X button from inside the modal, the popup closes but keeps the  
value of our variable set to true, so any change in the state of the component that requires it  
to re-render itself will cause the modal to open again. To resolve this, we need to set the value  
of \_isWelcomeModalOpen to false every time the user closes the modal using the X  
button, and that could happen by subscribing to the OnCloseClicked Eventcallback  
of ModalPopup.  
We are going to create an anonymous method using Lambda in C\# to set the value of the  
variable whenever OnCloseClicked gets fired as follows\:  
...  
\<ModalPopup Title="Hi!" IsOpen="@\_isWelcomeModalOpen"  
OnCloseClicked="\(\) =\> \_isWelcomeModalOpen = false"\>  
...  
5. The last step in our example is also to set \_isWelcomeModalOpen to false when the user  
clicks the Discover it button, so all we have to do is to repeat the little method but assign it to  
the onclick event of the button, as shown in the following code snippet\:  
...  
\<FooterContent\>  
\<button class="btn btn-primary"  
@onclick="\(\) =\> \_isWelcomeModalOpen = Developing templated components 73  
false"\> Discover It\</button\>  
\</FooterContent\>  
...  
Here you go! You have created and used your first templated component! After running the project  
and navigating to the Index page, you will notice the result shown in Figure 3.4.  
Note  
If you have a templated component that accepts a RenderFragment parameter, you can set  
its value directly inside the component without the need to open the tag with the name of the  
parameter, but the parameter must be called ChildContent.  
In our ModalPopup example, if we directly set elements inside the ModalPopup tag without  
using \<ChildContent\> or \<FooterContent\>, it will consider the content as the value  
for the ChildContent parameter so that markup will be rendered in the body of the modal.  
Generic templated components  
Until now, we have seen how we can pass UI markup to a Blazor component, but the concept of  
templated components goes beyond this to include the RenderFragment\<TType\> parameter \(you  
will discover the benefits of the TType parameter in the upcoming example\). The concept of generic  
is very popular in the world of programming and C\#. Specifically, it allows the developer to build a  
class that targets different types with the same code. For example, when we declare an instance of the  
famous List\<TType\> in C\#, we define its generic type as List\<Book\>, List\<int\>, and so on.  
Resultantly, all the members of the class \(methods, properties, and so on\) that target the T type will  
target the type defined in the initialization such as string, int, the custom types we create, and so on.  
With generic, .NET has to introduce one List class that is generic, so developers can use it to  
store any type they want. All the methods of the List class, such as Add and Remove, will work  
against the type we define. Without generic, .NET has to write the List class for each type, such as  
ListOfString, ListOfObject, and ListOfInt, which will lead to long repetitive code and  
won’t be able to cover the custom types that we create in our apps such as the Book class in our project.  
Blazor gives us the ability to develop generic templated components, such as List, defined in the  
.NET ecosystem. What does this mean? Let’s go back to our BookCard component, which we created  
in Chapter 2 to render a book as a card and then use it in other UIs. The component was basically  
accepting Book as a parameter and rendering it the same way every time except when the data was  
being passed to it.  
What if we want to develop a component called DataListView, and this component accepts a collection  
of the T data types \(the user can define the type of data that this component renders while using it\)  
and also allows us to define the template of how to render a single item of this collection? After that,  
DataListView renders that list for us either using a data grid concept \(in rows and columns such 74  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
as Instagram content in your profile\) or as a vertical list \(such as in your email inbox in Microsoft  
Outlook\). In addition to rendering the list, the component will provide us with the option of selecting  
an item, selecting multiple items, and some other functionality that we use whenever we have a list  
of data to deal with in the UI.  
This will make things much easier right? Having a single component to handle all of that for us will  
save us time and energy to repeat the same functionality for each type of data. All we need to do is  
declare the component, pass the list of data to it, and tell it how to render one item of it, and done.  
Let’s get started by developing the basic version of this component, which for now, will render the  
items in a grid view \(rows and columns\), and then we can extend its functionality whenever needed\:  
1\. 2. In the Shared folder, create a new Razor component and call it DataListView.razor.  
Now we need to define this component as a generic component, so we build it around a generic  
type, and when we want to use it, we pass the type of that parameter to, for example, Book,  
Car, int, and so on.  
To achieve this, we need to use the @typeparam Razor directive at the top of the component  
as follows\:  
@typeparam TItemType  
@code  
\{  
\}  
3. Define the parameters of our component. Basically, we will have the following parameters\:  
Items of the List\<TItemType\> type, which is the collected data the developer wants  
to render, ItemTemplate of the RenderFragment\<TItemType\> type, which is the  
UI of each item in the list, EventCallback\<TItemType\> called OnItemClicked,  
which will be fired every time the user clicks on any item from the collection, and finally, a  
ColumnsCount of the int type, which will be used to show how many items should be  
rendered horizontally in the grid\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
\[Parameter\]  
public List\<TItemType\>? Items \{ get; set; \}  
\[Parameter\]  
public RenderFragment\<TItemType\>  
ItemTemplate \{ get; set; \}  
\[Parameter\]  
public EventCallbackTItemType\> OnItemClicked \{  
get; set; \}  
\[Parameter\]  
public int ColumnsCount \{ get; set; \} = 4;  
\} 4\. 5. 6. Developing templated components 75  
Now, it’s time to design the markup. To render the items in a grid fashion, we are going to use  
the capabilities of the CSS flexbox to align the items horizontally and wrap them into new rows  
when the rows get completed. We will render each item within a div with the width based on  
the ColumnsCount parameter value \(25% width if, for example, the columns count is 4\).  
...  
\<div class="grid-container"\>  
@if \(Items != null && Items.Any\(\)\)  
\{  
foreach \(var item in Items\)  
\{  
\<div class="grid-item"\>  
@ItemTemplate\(item\)  
\</div\>  
\}  
\}  
else  
\{  
\<!-- Here can be used to show how the empty  
list will be handeled --\>  
\<h3 class="empty-collection-title"\>  
No items available\</h3\>  
\}  
\</div\>  
...  
Inside the div, we first checked whether the collection of items is null or empty showing the  
user a message indicating that there are no elements in the list rather than showing them an  
empty UI. This action improves the user experience. In an advanced scenario, you can pass a  
RenderFragement parameter called EmptyContentTemplate and render it instead  
of the H3 tag we must give the developer when using this component. This gives us the ability  
to control the content of the empty list.  
Another thing to notice in the eighth line of the preceding code snippet is that we rendered  
ItemTemplate, but we passed a parameter to it, which is the difference between a normal  
templated component and a generic one. When the developer defines the template for each  
item in the collection, that item will be available as a parameter so they can use it to render  
the data inside that item.  
Now, it’s time to add some styling to our component. Again, we will apply isolated styling by  
creating a new file in the Shared folder called DataListView.razor.css.  
Create a CSS class called .grid-container, which will define some properties to the  
parent div in the markup.  
.grid-container \{  
display\: flex; /\* Enable the flex box for the 76  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
elements inside the div \*/  
flex-wrap\: wrap; /\* Wrap the items inside when  
they reach the end of the row \*/  
padding\: 5px; /\* Define a little padding for the  
list \*/  
border\: 0.5px solid \#A3A3A3; /\* Set a slight  
border for it \*/  
\}  
7. Create a .grid-item CSS class to define the style of each item in the grid; we are not going  
to set the width property for each item because it will be generated based on the value passed  
by the developer, so we will set it inline in the markup\:  
...  
.grid-container .grid-item \{  
margin\: 4px; /\* Define a spacing around each  
item \*/  
cursor\: pointer; /\* Use pointer cursor to  
indicate that the item is clickable \*/  
\}  
8. The last style we will define is the style of the H3 tag for the empty list, which is just to centralize  
the text and set a little margin from the top\:  
...  
.grid-container .empty-collection-title \{  
text-align\: center;  
margin-top\: 10px;  
\}  
9\. 10. Back to the DataListView.razor file, we now need to calculate the width of each item  
based on the ColumnsCount passed to the component.  
To accomplish this, we just need to divide 100 by the number of columns, and we will get  
the width percentage required for each column and then assign the calculated percentage as  
a width style to div.  
So, after defining the parameters, we will create a read-only property called \_columnWidth,  
which is equal to 100 / ColumnsCount\:  
...  
private int \_columnWidth =\> 100 / ColumnsCount;  
... Developing templated components 77  
Then, set the style attribute of the div, which wraps the item template as follows\:  
...  
\<div class="grid-item" style="width\:@\_columnWidth%"\>  
@ItemTemplate\(item\)  
\</div\>  
...  
11. After rendering the preceding code snippet, if the developer passes 5 to the ColumnsCount  
parameter, then the value of the style attribute will have width\:20%.  
Finally, we just need to add the clickable functionality to the div grid item, so that whatever  
the content is, div can be clicked to fire OnItemClicked EventCallback. All we need  
to do is to assign the @onclick event of the div grid item to an anonymous function, which  
triggers EventCallback and pass the clicked item to it as a parameter\:  
...  
foreach \(var item in Items\)  
\{  
\<div class="grid-item"  
style="width\:@\_columnWidth%" @onclick="\(\) =\>  
OnItemClicked.InvokeAsync\(item\)"\>  
@ItemTemplate\(item\)  
\}  
...  
That’s all it takes to create an advanced generic templated component. Keep in mind when you are  
developing this kind of component to provide functionality and rendering logic for your different  
UIs and to minimize the number of changes needed while using it in different cases. You need to  
parametrize its logic as much as you can. For example, in DataListView, we can have parameters  
for the spacing \(margin and padding\), one for the border, one Boolean parameter to allow selection  
or not, and another Boolean to make the item clickable or not.  
Further, in real-world scenarios, the component should handle the values of its parameters correctly,  
so you can use the OnParametersSet method to validate the value of the parameters.  
Note  
The advanced code for the DataListView component can be found in the Complete folder  
within the repository of this book on GitHub and contains all the mentioned features\: https\://  
github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Blazor-WebAssembly/Complete. 78  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
Consuming a generic templated component  
An index component renders a list of books using the BookCard component. Now we will leverage  
our DataListView component to render that list of books for us. All we have to do is just pass the  
list of the books and define the template of each book, and it will handle the rest.  
Let’s go through this task to develop better functionality and code for our component\:  
1. In the Index.razor file, on top of the My cart section, let’s add a DataListView component  
and assign the value of TItemType to Book so the generic component defines the type it  
will use internally. Assign the \_books list we have in the Index to the Items parameter of  
the DataListView component and set ColumnsCount to 4\:  
...  
\<DataListView TItemType="Book" Items="\_books" ColumnsCount="4"\>  
\</DataListView\>  
...  
2\. 3. Now, we need to define the template of each item. We can do this by opening a tag with  
the ItemTemplate name, which will be the piece of UI that will be rendered inside the  
DataListView for each book.  
Basically, we need to keep rendering each book as a BookCard component, but this time, we  
don’t have the variable that exists in foreach to access each book object. Instead, we have  
a context variable within the tags of ItemTemplate, which represents the book, and the  
value of this variable is the value that we passed when we rendered the template in the 4th step  
of creating the component in the previous section\:  
...  
\<DataListView ItemType="Book" Items="\_books" ColumnsCount="4"\>  
\<ItemTemplate\>  
\<BookCard Book="@context"  
OnAddToCartClicked="AddToCart" /\>  
\</ItemTemplate\>  
\</DataListView\>  
...  
In some cases, you may have another context variable in your code, which will make the  
compiler unable to know which context variable to use. In this case, you can rename the  
default context variable explicitly using the Context attribute of the ItemTemplate tag  
as follows\:  
...  
\<ItemTemplate Context="book"\>  
... Rendering components dynamically 79  
4. The last step is removing the old iteration loop that we created below the H3 header of the My  
Books title.  
After running the project, the result won’t be very different, but what we have now is a more  
efficient way to render the list\: it’s a reusable component that we can use in many places in our  
project, and of course, we have more functionality to leverage and centralize in one place. So if  
we want to edit any of the list view functionality, we can do it in its component file, and it will  
affect all the places it was used in. Most importantly, you have learned how to think through  
and develop a real-world templated component from scratch\:  
Figure 3.6 – A list of books using the DataListView templated component  
Until now, we have learned about some cool concepts in Blazor that allow you to build some interactive  
and very reusable parts of a full single-page application, but that’s not everything. Blazor offers much  
more. In the next section, we will look at another interesting component type called a dynamic  
component, which helps us render some UIs dynamically.  
# Rendering components dynamically  
This section’s heading seems interesting, but haven’t we already seen how to render dynamic stuff in  
the UI? Well, what’s different here is that the component itself is not dynamic, but its rendering is.  
Let’s take a real-world scenario that we usually see in many advanced and big apps \(Azure Portal, for  
example\), which have a dashboard that is customizable by the user. This app offers a huge collection  
of widgets \(each widget is a component\) and the user can create their own dashboard by choosing  
which widgets to place on the dashboard page. 80  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
There are many solutions for such a scenario. For example, we can store the selected widget names  
in an array and then iterate over the array in the dashboard page, then make an if statement based  
on the name of the widget, and render the corresponding component. Actually, this works, but if you  
think about it, the need for a customizable dashboard means a massive number of widgets. Otherwise,  
there can be a fixed dashboard, and all the widgets are allocated somewhere on it.  
The if statement will make the code hard to maintain and very long, and we may make a mistake by  
rendering the wrong component in a certain if clause.  
This is where the dynamically rendered component comes into play; basically, it’s a built-in component  
called DynamicComponent provided by Blazor in .NET 7.0 that renders a specific component by  
passing its type as a parameter to DynamicComponent. Of course, we can pass parameters too.  
So, back to our dashboard example, we can store the name of each component type in an array  
and iterate over it on the dashboard page. Then, in each iteration, all we need to do is to render  
DynamicComponent and pass the type of the widget component to it, so the code will be a single  
component rendered within a foreach loop; internally, DynamicComponent will take care of  
the rest.  
Let’s see a quick example of how to use DynamicComponent to render the SurveyPrompt  
component initially created by the default Blazor template using its type\:  
1. In Counter.razor in the Pages folder, just to keep the Index page clean for now, let’s define  
a variable of type Type in C\#, which represents the variable’s data type \(for more information  
about the Type class, please visit https\://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/  
api/system.type?view=net-7.0\).  
Then, assign the typeof\(SuveryPrombt\) value to it. The typeof\(\) operator in C\#  
retrieves the Type parameter of a C\# data type as the following code snippet shows\:  
...  
private Type componentType = typeof\(SurveyPrompt\);  
2. The componentType variable can hold the type of any component we have in our project, so  
using this variable to render a component is what makes things very dynamic in that fashion.  
In the Razor markup, create DynamicComponent and pass the componetType variable  
to its Type parameter as follows\:  
...  
\<DynamicComponent Type="componentType" /\>  
...  
Now, if we run the project and navigate to the /counter page, you will notice the  
SurveyPrompt component rendered in the UI, and that magic happens just using its  
own type. So, if we change the value of the componentType parameter at runtime, we will  
notice another component will be rendered instead of SurveyPrompt, and that’s what gives  
DynamicComponent the power to handle such scenarios\: Rendering components dynamically 81  
Figure 3.7 – The SurveyPrompt component rendered using DynamicComponent  
This also leads to a question\: what if the rendered component takes parameters? DynamicComponent  
handles this case by providing us with a Dictionary\<string, object\> parameter, which  
contains a list of key values \(key of type string represents the name of the parameter, and the value is  
of type object that could be the value of that parameter\), so we can use that dictionary to supply the  
parameters of the component being rendered by DynamicComponent.  
The following code snippet supplies the Title parameter of type string that the SurveyPrompt  
component accepts using the Parameters of DynamicComponent\:  
...  
\<DynamicComponent Type="componentType" Parameters="parameters" /\>  
@code \{  
...  
private Type componentType = typeof\(SurveyPrompt\);  
private Dictionary\<string, object\> parameters = new\(\)  
\{  
\{ "Title", "Welcome to Blazor" \}  
\};  
\}  
Many advanced features can be delivered using DynamicComponent, such as the dashboard example  
we provided, or allowing the admin to change how the sections on the home page of their app look  
without the need to change the code. All these tasks are covered within the Complete folder in the  
GitHub repo of this book.  
Now let’s make our code even more reusable by discovering the Razor Class Library project. 82  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
# Using the Razor Class Library for packaging and  
# reusability  
We have created plenty of components in this chapter and the previous one, but as you may have  
noticed, all those components are mostly located in the same project within the Shared folder. So,  
you may have wondered how to use the exact same component in other projects within the same  
solution or maybe within a totally different solution.  
.NET offers another type of project called the Razor Class Library, and the main purpose of this project  
is to have a Blazor component, and then you can reference this project within your other projects,  
solutions, your entire organization, or even publish it as a NuGet package so it could be used by other  
developers worldwide.  
In this section, we will create a new Razor Class Library project, reference it within our Books Store  
project, and learn how to reference static resources such as CSS and JavaScript files within our Blazor  
WebAssembly project.  
Sometimes, reusability is not limited to the level of certain components; it becomes mandatory in  
some cases, such as when developing web and mobile clients with Blazor and .NET Multi-platform  
App UI \(MAUI\). In such cases, you will have a Blazor WebAssembly project and a .NET MAUI one.  
So, a Razor Class Library project is needed here to host the components, and the pages are shared  
between the mobile and the web app.  
Creating a Razor Class Library project  
Inside our BooksStore Visual Studio solution, we will add a Razor Class Library project and  
give it the name BooksStore.Blazor.Components. To achieve this, take the following steps\:  
1\. 2. Right-click on the solution and click on Add | New Project.  
In the pop-up box for adding a new project in Visual Studio, search for Razor Class  
Library and choose the project as shown in the following screenshot\: Using the Razor Class Library for packaging and reusability 83  
Figure 3.8 – Add the Razor Class Library project  
3. Give it the name BooksStore.Blazor.Components and then click Next, then Create.  
By default, the project gets created and initialized with the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
wwwroot folder\: This is the folder where we can have static resources such as the global  
CSS file\(s\), images, and JavaScript files.  
By default, it has the Background.png and exampleJsInterop.js files as examples,  
and we can remove them safely for now.  
\_Imports.razor\: This is the file where we can host the shared parts that can be used in  
other components or define the shared layout for all the existing components within the project.  
Component1.razor\: This is a simple example component; we can remove it if we like.  
•  
ExampleJsInterop.cs\: This is a C\# service to demonstrate the integration with JavaScript.  
We can remove this, too, as we will learn more about Blazor and JavaScript in Chapter 6,  
Consuming JavaScript in Blazor.  
After creating the project, we can now start creating our shared components inside it, but before doing  
so, let’s reference this library project in our BooksStore project. 84  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
Referencing the Razor Class Library in the Blazor WebAssembly  
project  
Referencing the Razor Class Library in a Blazor WebAssembly project requires two steps. The first is  
adding the assembly to the references of the Blazor WebAssembly project, and the second is adding  
references to the styles and enabling the scoped styles for the CSS isolated for each component and  
reference JavaScript files if any.  
Let’s accomplish the following steps to achieve our goal\:  
1\. 2. Right-click on Dependencies for the BooksStore project and click Add Project Reference  
All other projects existing within the solution will be listed; choose BooksStore.Blazor.  
Components and then click OK.  
Figure 3.9 – Choose the Razor Class Library project to add as a dependency Using the Razor Class Library for packaging and reusability 85  
3. Now, we need to enable the scoped styles that we will add to our components in the Razor Class  
Library, and to do so, we need to add a link tag in the header of the index.html file of the  
Blazor project existing in the wwwroot folder. And that link will refer to the following location  
\_Content/\{ProjectName\}/Styles.css. So, in our example, it will be \_Content/  
BooksStore.Blazor.Components/Styles.css as follows\:  
\<head\>  
...  
\<link href="\_Content/BooksStore.Blazor.Components/styles.css"  
rel="stylesheet" /\>  
\</head\>  
4. Also, we can add the namespace reference existing in our Razor Class Library project, so all  
the components and pages in Blazor WebAssembly have access to it without the need to add  
them every time in each component by adding them to the \_Imports.razor file. We will  
skip this step for now, as our Razor Class Library project has no components yet.  
If any CSS file exists within the wwwroot folder of the Razor Class Library project, we can  
reference it using the same previous step but by using the name of the file. For example, if we  
have a CSS file called components.css in the Razor Class Library project, we can reference  
it as follows\:  
...  
\<link href="\_Content/BooksStore.Blazor.Components/components.  
css" rel="stylesheet" /\>  
...  
5. Finally, if there are any JavaScript files, we can reference them using the same reference link of  
the CSS files, such as \_Content/ProjectName/JavaScriptFileName.js, and we  
can add it to the bottom of the body tag in the index.html file. For example, if we have a  
file called component1-logic.js, we can reference it as follows\:  
...  
\<script src=  
"\_Content/BooksStore.Blazor.Components/  
component1-logic.js"\>\</script\>  
\</body\>  
\</html\>  
The BooksStore.Blazor.Components Razor Class Library project will be used heavily  
throughout the rest of the book by adding most of the new components that we will create in the  
later chapters of this book. 86  
Developing Advanced Components in Blazor  
Note  
If your project is a Razor Class Library project that any developer or any team within your  
organization can use, you can publish it to NuGet to make it accessible to them. The following  
link shows you the details of doing so\: https\://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/  
nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package-using-visual-  
studio?tabs=netcore-cli.  
Now, we have a clean project we can use and reference anywhere, which will host all of our reusable  
components. This step will help keep our Blazor WebAssembly small and clean and provide us with  
the ability to have all the reusable components just a project reference away.  
# Summary

# Navigation and Routing  
Every software consists of a set of pages, each of which is responsible for a certain task in the UI and  
the functionality of the app. Within this chapter, we are going to understand the routers in the Blazor  
WebAssembly app, including what they are, how they work, and how to define them so that users  
can navigate between your app pages. We will also learn how to send data between pages via the URL  
and query parameters. After that, we will implement a custom UI for when the user navigates to a  
non-existent URL. Furthermore, we will dive a bit deeper and learn about some advanced scenarios,  
such as reacting to URL changes, taking actions such as cancelling ongoing tasks, and highlighting  
parts of the UI based on changes.  
In previous chapters, we learned about components and developed individual pieces; throughout  
this chapter, we will put these components together within pages and implement routing so we can  
navigate and send data between them.  
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics\:

Navigation and Routing  
# Understanding routing and pages  
With any app you use, whether it’s a native mobile or Windows app or a website, you will see it is made  
up of a set of pages users can move between. In the scope of the web specifically, we have traditional  
websites and web apps that work on the server, and we have apps that run fully in the browser, such  
as Blazor WebAssembly apps.  
With the traditional web approach, there is no actual navigation happening in the browser because  
what happens is that the browser sends a request to the server for a specific URL, the server comes  
back with the HTML, and then the browser just renders it. On the other hand, with single-page  
applications, the whole app is running totally in the client, and we have a single HTML page that holds  
the entire UI of our app. Frameworks such as Blazor, Angular, or ReactJS, for instance, are responsible  
for replacing part of the UI according to the redirected link with the corresponding component, and  
that is what we call routing.  
Routing is the process of matching the body component of the app with the requested URL. As seen  
in the Building layouts in Blazor section in Chapter 3, Developing Advanced Components in Blazor,  
within the layout component, we render the @Body property and that’s where the page content of a  
specific URL will be shown. Now, we understand components and routing, but what are pages in Blazor?  
Basically, a page in Blazor is a normal Razor component but we declare a router for it at the very top  
using the @page razor directive. This router is the URL used to access the component as follows\:  
@page "/counter"  
...  
The /counter value defined in the previous code snippet is used to declare that the Counter  
component can be accessed using the URL \(app\_base\_url/counter\).  
Now, let’s see who is responsible for this routing experience in Blazor.  
The Router component in Blazor  
If you navigate to the App.razor component, which is the root of every Blazor app, you will see  
that the first component called Router wraps all other components and it has a parameter called  
AppAssembly, which we will talk about in a bit\:  
\<Router AppAssembly="@typeof\(App\).Assembly"\>  
...  
\</Router\>  
The Router component is responsible for reading the routes and matching them with the components  
when the user navigates to that route or link.  
The AppAssembly parameter, which is set to the Assembly of the project, tells the Router  
component where to look for components that have routes. By default, the Router component will Understanding routing and pages 93  
look into the project assembly only, but if you have other pages existing in another Razor Class library  
project, Router won’t be able to recognize these routes. To make Router look for pages in many  
assemblies, we need to use other parameters called AdditionalAssemblies and pass a collection  
of assemblies so that Router will look for and register all the available routes.  
The following code snippet shows an example of adding the Razor Class Library assembly to Router  
to crawl its pages\:  
@using BooksStore.Blazor.Components  
\<Router AppAssembly="@typeof\(App\).Assembly"  
AdditionalAssemblies="new\[\] \{ typeof\(Component1\).Assembly \}"\>  
...  
Component1 represents a component existing in a Razor Class Library project. We just use it to  
bring the full assembly that contains a certain type. In our BooksStore project, all our pages will be  
defined in the BooksStore Blazor WebAssembly; the Razor Class Library project will not contain  
pages, just shared components.  
Creating your first page  
After learning about Router and how navigation works, let’s get started by creating our first page  
and discover the NavigationManager class, which helps us write code to navigate, as well as  
using the PageTitle component introduced in Blazor with .NET 6, which allows us to change the  
title of the page in the browser tab\:  
1\. 2. 3. Create a new component in the Pages/UserPages folder and name it About.razor.  
This component will be a simple page that represents some info about the project.  
At the very top of the About.razor file, we need to declare a route for this component to  
be accessible through \{App\_Url\}/about using the @page directive.  
In addition to that, when the user navigates to the About page, we need to change the title in  
the browser tab, and we can achieve that using the PageTitle component as follows\:  
@page "/about"  
\<PageTitle\>About\</PageTitle\>  
...  
4\. Finally, add some UI content to fill out some information about the app\:  
...  
\<h2\>Welcome to BooksStore\</h2\>  
\<p\>BooksStore allows you to disover best titles in tech and  
more\</p\>  
If we run the app and navigate to /about, we should see the following page\: 94  
Navigation and Routing  
Figure 4.1 – The About page  
Note  
Each page can have multiple routes, for example, the Index page can have home. Therefore, Router will register three URLs for the same component.  
/, /index, and /  
The examples you have seen in this section show you just the basics of navigation and routing in a  
simple setup. In real-world apps, some pages are connected, and we need to send data between those  
pages using parameters.  
# Navigation and parameters  
In BooksStore, for example, the user can see a list of books on the Index page, but the user should  
also be able to click on a book and navigate to another page where all the book details are visible.  
When we navigate to the details page, we need to pass the book ID to it so that the page knows the  
book for which the details need to be retrieved.  
Luckily, Blazor provides us with powerful and flexible routing and navigation mechanisms that allow  
us to navigate easily and send data in the URL, either by using the route of the page itself or using  
query parameters. We are going to explain both in detail.  
Passing parameters using the route  
Parameters can be sent within the route of the page. The Router component is responsible for  
detecting those parameters and filling in the values from the URL for the parameters in the targeted  
component based on the parameter name.  
In the next example, we are going to create a BookDetails component and set a route for it, just  
like what we did for the About component; however, this route should include the book ID. The  
BookDetails component will have a string parameter called BookId, and Router will  
populate the book ID from the route. Navigation and parameters 95  
To define a parameter within the route, we use a curly bracket with the name of the parameter inside  
as follows\:  
@page "/book/\{bookId\}"  
bookId in the route should have a corresponding parameter in the component with the same name but  
Router is case-insensitive, so its parameter can be called BookId. For example, if the user navigates  
to https\://localhost\:44386/book/mastering-blazor-webassembly-2022,  
Router will supply mastering-blazor-webassembly-2022 to the BookId parameter  
after navigating to the BookDetails component.  
Now, let’s see this in practice\:  
1. Create a new component within the Pages/UserPages folder and name it BookDetails.  
razor.  
2. Declare a Router component for this page that accepts a book ID as a parameter at the top  
of the component\:  
@page "/book/\{bookId\}"  
3\. Add a code section to the Razor file and add a parameter inside it called BookId\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
\[Parameter\]  
public string? BookId \{ get; set; \}  
4\. This is all that we need to get the book ID from the URL.  
Now, we can start writing the content and the logic of the component. We need to write the  
method that retrieves a book by its ID. Let’s move to the IBooksService interface we  
created in Chapter 1, Understanding the Anatomy of a Blazor WebAssembly Project, and create  
a new method called GetBookIdAsync that takes the book ID as a string parameter and  
returns a Task of type Book\:  
public interface IBooksService  
\{  
...  
Task\<Book?\> GetBookByIdAsync\(string? id\);  
\} 96  
Navigation and Routing  
5. Now, in the LocalBooksService class in the Services folder, let’s write an implementation  
for the previous method in the interface that retrieves a book from the local list we have in  
the service\:  
...  
public Task\<Book?\> GetBookByIdAsync\(string? id\)  
\{  
var book = \_allBooks.SingleOrDefault\(b =\> b.Id ==  
id\);  
return Task.FromResult\(book\);  
\}  
6. Now that we added the method to the service, let’s inject it into the BookDetails component  
and call the function to retrieve the book by the ID passed in the URL. We can achieve this  
by overriding the OnInitializedAsync method that is triggered when the component  
is initialized. The component code should look like the following\:  
@page "/book/\{bookId\}"  
@inject IBooksService BooksService  
@code  
\{  
\[Parameter\]  
public string? BookId \{ get; set; \}  
private Book? \_book = null;  
protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
\_book =  
await BooksService.GetBookByIdAsync\(BookId\);  
\}  
\}  
7. Next, before we design the UI, let’s override the OnParametersSet method that gets called  
after the parameter values of the components are set. This override will help us to print the  
BookId parameter’s value in the console window of the browser\:  
...  
protected override void OnParametersSet\(\)  
\{  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"The book id is \{BookId\}"\);  
\}  
... Navigation and parameters 97  
8\. Last but not least, we write the component to render the book details\:  
@inject IBooksService BooksService  
...  
\<PageTitle\>Book Details | @\_book?.Title\</PageTitle\>  
\<h2\>@\_book?.Title\</h2\>  
\<p\>@\_book?.Description\</p\>  
\<ul\>  
\<li\>Page\: \$@\_book?.Price\</li\>  
\<li\>Author\: @\_book?.AuthorName\</li\>  
\</ul\>  
@code  
\{  
...  
The preceding code denotes the basic design for rendering the details of the book. Now, we  
can move to the next part of the process, which is the programmatical navigation to this page.  
After we develop the new BookDetails page, the next phase is to navigate the user to it from  
the Index component when the user clicks on any BookCard component. Here is where the  
NavigationManager service comes into play. It’s a built-in service in Blazor that provides you  
with the NavigateTo method, in addition to a set of helper methods for retrieving and manipulating  
the URL and the parameters inside it.  
In the following steps, we will be using NavigationManager in the BookCard component we  
created in Chapter 2, Components in Blazor, to navigate to the BookDetails code, so let’s get started\:  
1. Within the Shared folder, open the BookCard.razor component and inject the  
NavigationManager service at the top as follows\:  
@inject NavigationManager Navigation  
...  
2. In the @code section of the component, create a new method and call it  
NavigateToBookDetails, and inside it, we need to navigate to /book/Book\_Id\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
private void NavigateToBookDetails\(\)  
\{  
var url = \$"/book/\{Book.Id\}";  
Navigation.NavigateTo\(url\);  
\}  
\} 98  
Navigation and Routing  
3\. 4. Finally, we just need to call the previous method when the user clicks on any point on the card.  
In the parent div of the card, set the NavigateToBookDetails method to the @onclick  
event as follows, and you are ready to go\:  
@inject NavigationManager Navigation  
\<div style="@BackgroundStyle"  
@attributes="UserAttributes"  
class="card"  
@onclick="NavigateToBookDetails"\>  
...  
We are ready now to test what we have accomplished, so from the Index page, if we click on any  
BookCard listed, the app should redirect you to the BookDetails page, and the ID of the book should  
be printed in the console window of the browser, as shown in the following screenshot\:  
Figure 4.2 – The BookDetails page  
Route parameter special conditions  
What we have achieved is the ideal case; here is a list of special conditions and possibilities available  
for the router parameters\:  
•  
Multiple router parameters\: Blazor allows you to set multiple parameters in a single route and  
the following URL shows how to achieve it\:  
@page "/profile/\{id\}/\{onlyPosts\}" Navigation and parameters 99  
•  
The previous route shows that the component takes two parameters\: one called Id and the  
other one called OnlyPosts as an example of multiple parameters.  
Parameter constraints\: Since the URL is a pure string, a value such as true can be set to  
a string parameter value or a bool value. Blazor provides a great feature that allows you  
to define explicitly what type of parameter is in the route directly. If we take the same route  
from the previous example of the profile, and we need to specify explicitly that Id is int and  
OnlyPosts is the bool value from the URL, we can declare the same route as follows\:  
@page "/profile/\{id\:int\}/\{onlyPosts\:bool\}"  
•  
•  
Of course, the component parameters must have the same type declared in the route.  
Blazor supports the following C\# types for route parameters\: bool, datetime, double,  
float, guid, int, long, and, of course, string, which is the default.  
Optional parameters\: By default, if a route parameter value is not supplied in the URL, the  
user will be redirected to the not found UI. Some parameters can be optional, a very common  
scenario in real-world apps.  
Back in our profile example, the Id value is required, but the OnlyPosts bool parameter can  
be optional and has default values of true or false set in the component parameter declaration.  
To mark a route parameter as optional, we use ? with the name of the parameter in the route,  
as follows\:  
@page "/profile/\{id\:int\}/\{onlyPosts\:bool?\}"  
Or if the type of the parameter is not defined, it could be like this\:  
@page "/profile/\{id\:int\}/\{onlyPosts?\}"  
Now that we have discovered the route parameters, let’s move to the other type of URL parameter\:  
query string parameters.  
Query string parameters  
Query strings are basically a set of key-value pairs defined in a URL that assigns values to a set of  
parameters. The following URL shows how query strings are defined\:  
https\://example.com/search?query=blazor&fromYear=2022  
After? in the previous link, you can see query=blazor, which is a parameter called query, and  
its value is set to blazor. Similarly, the value of fromYear is 2022. Parameters can be combined  
using the & operator.  
In .NET 6.0, Blazor started support for query string parameters, and we can add as many parameters as  
we want to our component using the \[SupplyParameterFromQuery\] C\# attribute; no changes  
are needed in the route of the page. Also, the name of the component parameter should not match the 100  
Navigation and Routing  
name in the query string parameter in the URL. The \[SupplyParameterFromQuery\] attribute  
has a Name property, which you can use to define the name of the parameter in the URL.  
Let’s do an experiment to see how this works.  
Back in the famous Counter component, we will add a parameter that sets the default value of  
the \_currentCount variable in the components, and the value of this parameter will use a query  
string from the URL. The \_currentCount default value is 0, but with the parameter we will add,  
the initial value can be set optionally from the URL like this\:  
app\_base\_url/counter?currentCount=10  
To achieve what have explained, let’s go through a few simple steps\:  
1\. 2. Open the Counter.razor component within the Pages folder.  
In the @code section, add an int? nullable parameter and decorate it with the  
\[SupplyParameterFromQuery\(Name = "currentCount"\)\] attribute, in addition  
to the \[Parameter\] attribute; you can give the parameter any name you want\:  
...  
@code \{  
\[Parameter\]  
\[SupplyParameterFromQuery\(Name = "currentCount"\)\]  
public int? CounterInitialValue \{ get; set; \}  
...  
3\. The name of the query parameter must be currentCount, equal to the value of the Name  
property of the \[SupplyParameterFromQuery\] attribute.  
Override the OnParameterSet method and set the value of the private currentCount  
int variable in the component to the value of CounterInitialValue if supplied\:  
...  
protected override void OnParametersSet\(\)  
\{  
if \(CounterInitialValue != null\)  
currentCount = CounterInitialValue.Value;  
\}  
...  
Now, let’s run the app and navigate to the /counter page. By default, you will notice the current  
count in the UI starts from 0, but if we navigate to /counter?currentCount=10, you will notice  
the value of the current count will start from 10 as shown in the following image\: Navigation and parameters 101  
Figure 4.3 – Counter page with query string parameters  
The real-world applications of query string parameters are endless. They are basically everywhere in  
web apps. An example is a page that renders a list of data \(books, for example\), for which you can  
use query parameters to define the query that the user is searching for, the number of items on each  
page, and the number of the page.  
We are going to use them in many places throughout this book to send data between pages.  
When you have a page that has one or more query parameters, building the URL to navigate to that page  
may seem a bit tricky because you could miss & between the parameters or =, as it’s a pure string and  
that could break the parameters and their values. The NavigationManager service provides us with  
two helper functions, GetUriWithQueryParameter and GetUriWithQueryParameters,  
that can help you build a URL with a single or multiple query parameter.  
The following code retrieves the URL of the app with a query parameter called search and has the  
Blazor value assigned to it\:  
var url = Navigation.GetUriWithQueryParameter\("search", "Blazor"\);  
The output of the url variable will be as follows\:  
https\://app\_base-url?search=Blazor  
The preceding example retrieves a URL with a single query parameter; the following one will use the  
GetUriWithQueryParameters method to retrieve a URL with many query string parameters  
as follows\:  
var url = Navigation.GetUriWithQueryParameters\("search", new  
Dictionary\<string, object?\>  
\{  
\{ "search", "Blazor" \}, 102  
Navigation and Routing  
\{ "pageIndex", 1 \},  
\{ "pageSize", 10 \},  
\{ "activeOnly", true \},  
\}\);  
The preceding code will set the following value for the url variable\:  
https\://Base\_URL\_Of\_  
App?search=Blazor&pageIndex=1&pageSize=10&activeOnly=true  
Query string versus route parameters  
Both string and route parameter types allow data transition via the URL, and both make you achieve  
what are you aiming for. Route parameters are tied to the URL and have predefined orders and shapes.  
However, the parameter is not human-readable, as it is declared internally as part of the URL and not  
using the key-value approach. Thus, it is recommended to use the parameter only when it is an actual  
part of the URL and not supplementary. Like in the example of the BookDetails page, the ID of the  
book is required, and it’s a mandatory part of the URL. On the other hand, query string parameters  
are very flexible and popular; you can use them whenever you want to supply your component with  
some initial values for its parameters.  
By now, you should be able to make your app pages linked with each other. In the next section, we  
will handle the UI for the requested URLs in your app that are not found.  
# Handling a NotFound UI  
The Router component in Blazor has two important RenderFragment parameters. The first one  
is called Found and the other one is called NotFound. You can notice their UI piece values in the  
App.razor component\:  
\<Router AppAssembly="@typeof\(App\).Assembly"  
AdditionalAssemblies="new\[\] \{ typeof\(Component1\).Assembly \}"\>  
\<Found Context="routeData"\>  
...  
\</Found\>  
\<NotFound\>  
\<PageTitle\>Not found\</PageTitle\>  
\<LayoutView Layout="@typeof\(MainLayout\)"\>  
\<p role="alert"\>Sorry, there's nothing at this  
address.\</p\>  
\</LayoutView\>  
\</NotFound\>  
\</Router\> Handling a NotFound UI 103  
The NotFound UI chunk will be rendered when the user navigates to a link that is not registered in  
the router. So, manipulating the content within the NotFound parameter tags will allow you to set  
your custom content for the not found UI.  
In Chapter 3, Developing Advanced Components in Blazor, we have changed the NotFound section  
to try out the LayoutView component. Now, we are just going to add a little div with text and  
description in the middle that shows the request page cannot be found, and change the layout of the  
NotFound portion to UserLayout instead of MainLayout as follows\:  
...  
\<NotFound\>  
\<PageTitle\>Not found\</PageTitle\>  
\<LayoutView Layout="@typeof\(UserLayout\)"\>  
\<div style="text-align\:center;margin-top\:20px"\>  
\<h3\>\<span style="color\:red"\>  
\<strong\>Oops!\</strong\>\</span\> Nothing can be  
found at this address\</h3\>  
\<p\>It looks like the page your requested in the  
URL cannot be found\</p\>  
\</div\>  
\</LayoutView\>  
\</NotFound\>  
...  
Next, try to run the app and navigate to an unexciting link – for example, /nothing – and you  
should see a UI like the one in the following screenshot\:  
Figure 4.4 – Not found improved UI  
If the design of your not found UI is complicated or you want to share it with other projects, you  
can either create it in a separate Razor component in the Shared folder and render it inside the  
NotFound section, or create it in the Razor Class Library project so that you can share it  
with other projects too. This approach will keep your App.razor file short and clean. 104  
Navigation and Routing  
Step by step, you are learning new things to help you complete the story of your app, get it all together,  
and make it look shiny for your users. In the next section, we are going to see how we can react to  
navigation changes in the app and why we need to do so.  
# Reacting to navigation changes  
In the logic of your apps, sometimes, you need to react to the navigation of the user by taking them to  
a new URL for many reasons, such as needing to highlight a certain component in the UI if the user  
navigates to a specific URL, or needing to execute a piece of code when the user navigates from the  
current page. In this section, we will learn about the NavLink component and LocationChanged  
within the NavigationManager service.  
The NavLink Component  
Blazor contains a built-in component called NavLink. This component is basically just the normal  
hyperlink tag \(\<a\>\) in HTML that allows the user to redirect to a specific link using the href attribute.  
What makes NavLink different from using the normal HTML hyperlink tag is that NavLink reacts  
to the URL changes, and if the current URL matches the link defined in its href attribute, it sets a  
CSS class called active and removes it when the URL doesn’t match. That makes the NavLink  
component perfect to use in building nav menus because when the user redirects to a specific URL,  
that link gets highlighted by adding some CSS styles for it.  
In the next example, we are going to modify the NavBar component that is used in UserLayout  
to use the NavLink component instead of the normal HTML \<a\> tags.  
NavLink will be able to toggle the active class when the app is within the page that this link  
redirects to and remove it when the user navigates away. We can highlight the link by just adding a  
CSS class to apply some styles to the active class\:  
1\. 2. Open NavBar.razor in the Shared folder.  
Replace all the \<a\> elements within the ul HTML element with NavLink, and remove the  
active class from the \<a\> tag that redirects to the Home page as follows\:  
...  
\<ul class="navbar-nav"\>  
\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<NavLink class="nav-link"  
href="/"\>Home\</NavLink\>  
\</li\>  
\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<NavLink class="nav-link"  
href="/Counter"\>Counter  
\</NavLink\>  
\</li\> Reacting to navigation changes 105  
\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<NavLink class="nav-link"  
href="/FetchData"\>Fetch Data  
\</NavLink\>  
\</li\>  
\</ul\>  
...  
Now, if you run the app, you will notice by default the Home link is highlighted, and if you click on  
the Fetch Data link, then it will be highlighted too. That’s basically the result of toggling the active  
CSS class applied and the default style you notice is coming from the styling the Bootstrap referenced  
in the default Blazor template\:  
Figure 4.5 – The hyperlink is highlighted due to the URL change detector  
The LocationChanged event in NavigationManager  
The NavigationManager service provides a C\# event called LocationChanged. This event  
is fired every time the URL is changed either explicitly from the browser or using the NavigateTo  
function from within the app itself. Also, NavigationManager passes the required arguments  
to the event handlers subscribed to the LocationChanged event, which are the senders of the  
type object. This object represents the object that fired the event and the second argument of the  
LocationChangedEventArgs type, which holds two properties about the navigation changes  
that have occurred\:  
•  
•  
Location\: This string value represents the new URL  
IsNavigationIntercepted\: This bool value indicates whether Blazor detected the URL change  
from the browser or by using the NavigateTo method 106  
Navigation and Routing  
The following example, if you follow through with it, will show you how you can subscribe and  
unsubscribe to the LocationChanged event\:  
1\. 2. Open the Index.razor component in the Pages/UserPages folder.  
Inject the NavigationManager service into the component, as shown in the following  
code snippet\:  
...  
@inject NavigationManager Navigation  
...  
3. Make the component implement the IDisposable interface using the @implement  
Razor directive because we need Blazor to call the Dispose method to unsubscribe from  
the LocationChanged event\:  
...  
@inject NavigationManager Navigation  
@implements IDisposable  
...  
4\. 5. Write a function and call it Navigation\_LocationChanged. This function will take  
two parameters. The first is of object type and called sender, and the second is of  
LocationChangedEventArgs type and called e. The LocationChangedEventArgs  
object contains the Location property and another property of the bool type called  
IsNavigationIntercepted.  
For our example, all Navigation\_LocationChanged will do is print the new URL in  
the Console window of the browser, so your method will look like the following snippet\:  
...  
private void Navigation\_LocationChanged\(object? sender,  
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.LocationChangedEventArgs  
e\)  
\{  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"The location changed to  
\{e.Location\}"\);  
\}  
...  
6. Now, we have everything ready and we just need to subscribe to the method we created for the  
LocationChanged event so that it gets fired every time the user navigates in your app. So,  
add the following line in the OnInitializedAsync method so that we can subscribe to  
it when the Index component is initialized\:  
...  
protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{ Reacting to navigation changes 107  
Navigation.LocationChanged +=  
Navigation\_LocationChanged;  
...  
7. The last step is to write the Dispose function provided in the IDisposal interface, which  
will be called automatically by Blazor when the Index components is disposed. So, we will  
take advantage of that to unsubscribe from the LocationChanged event because if we don’t  
unsubscribe, we may cause a memory leak due to too many subscriptions\:  
...  
public void Dispose\(\)  
\{  
Navigation.LocationChanged -=  
Navigation\_LocationChanged;  
\}  
...  
Now, let’s run the app and monitor the Console window. You will notice that every time you leave  
the Index page by clicking on a book card or going to the Fetch Data page, a message is written, as  
shown in the following screenshot\:  
Figure 4.6 – Reaction to the LocationChanged event being fired 108  
Navigation and Routing  
The NavigationLock component  
The NavigationLock component intercepts navigation events more effectively by giving us the control  
to lock any navigation operation until a certain condition is met or requires a certain action before  
the navigation process happens.  
The lifetime of the NavigationLock component is scoped to the lifetime of the component it’s  
rendered inside.  
NavigationLock accepts two parameters\:  
•  
ConfirmExternalNavigation\: The default value is false, and it basically instructs the browser  
to prompt the user to confirm the navigation process to an external URL typed in the address bar.  
The user will be prompted only if the state of the page has changed. Let’s see the following example.  
In the Index.razor page, add the NavigationLock component, and set  
ConfirmExternalNavigation to true as shown\:  
...  
\<NavigationLock ConfirmExternalNavigation="true" /\>  
...  
Now, if you run the app and try to navigate to any site, you will be redirected normally. However,  
if you close the modal that shows at the beginning and then try to navigate to an external site, the  
navigation will be locked until you confirm the operation, as shown in the following screenshot\:  
•  
Figure 4.7 – Dialog prompts the user to confirm the navigation  
OnBeforeInternalNavigation\: A callback that allows you to execute some logic before the  
internal navigation process occurs. This is useful to ask the user to save changes or wait until a  
certain operation is finished before leaving the page. The method to assign to the callback must  
take a parameter of the LocationChangingContext type; the object passed contains all  
the metadata about the navigation process. Summary 109  
We will be using this callback in Chapter 5, Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation,  
when we build a page for the admin to insert a new book.  
By understanding the points mentioned, you should have more flexibility in controlling the process of  
your app development with Blazor and have wider knowledge to handle certain cases and problems  
that you may face along the way.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we introduced and applied all the concepts related to navigation and routing in a Blazor  
WebAssembly application. We started first by understanding routing and the Router component,  
and then we declared our first component that had a router. After that, we saw how to use the routing  
abilities in Blazor to transmit data between the pages using route and query string parameters. Then,  
we learned how to handle the not found UI and designed a simple and neat component for it.  
Finally, we saw how we can take action and manipulate the UI when a navigation process happens  
in an application.  
After going through this chapter, you should be able to do the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
Create pages in your application and declare routes for them  
Send data between pages using the route and query string parameters  
Provide a custom UI for the not found address  
•  
Take certain actions when a navigation process occurs in the app  
In the next chapter, we will start exploring a very interactive topic, which is asking the user for data  
input using forms, learning how to validate this data, and developing a custom input component by  
leveraging the InputBase\<T\> class.

# Capturing User Input with  
# Forms and Validation  
So far, we have learned how to develop components, but all of the components we have built are for  
displaying data and rendering the UI of the app. Now, we will learn about existing components and  
develop new ones to build forms that allow the user to insert data and validate it. In almost every app  
you build, you will need to ask your users for some input. Whether you are building a social network  
platform, a point-of-sale app, a chat app, or even a simple blog, user input is always required, either  
to submit a new post, insert a new sales record, or submit a comment on a blog post.  
In this chapter, we will cover everything you need to know to build simple and advanced forms. We  
will discover how Blazor deals with forms, in addition to the different input components that are built  
into Blazor. After building a form, we will deep-dive into the different methods of validating the data  
provided by the user. Finally, we will see an example of how to develop a custom input component if  
your needs are not fulfilled by Blazor.  
By the end of this chapter, and after going through the submission form example, you should be able  
to utilize Blazor capabilities to develop forms with different kinds of input components. Combining  
what you will learn in this chapter with what you have already learned so far, such as how to build a  
modal popup, will provide you with the necessary comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience  
to cover most of the scenarios you will face with your apps.  
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics\:

# Understanding forms in Blazor  
Forms are basically sets of one or more input controls, such as text, numbers, and dates. Data collected  
through forms is submitted at once to achieve a task such as adding a new product to the stock. Let’s  
look at an example of a social network platform\: users should be able to add new posts or edit existing  
posts. In addition to that, users must be able to comment on other users’ posts. To achieve all of that,  
you need a mechanism for collecting post interaction \(insertion or deletion\) data through the UI.  
This data collection is made possible through forms.  
Another example where forms are useful is a job-seeking platform where companies publish their  
vacancies and job seekers search and apply for them. A form is needed so that HR users at the companies  
can submit their job positions with information such as descriptions, availability, conditions, and  
salaries. On the other hand, the user needs a form to pick a job to apply for, upload their CV and  
covering letter, enter the expected salary, and so on.  
Forms in HTML  
Forms are utilities that allow you to build one or a group of input elements to collect a set of data to  
accomplish a certain task. Traditional web apps already have the concept of forms in the \<form\> tag  
element in HTML, but before we deep-dive technically, let’s discuss the benefits of forms.  
In normal web apps that are built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, the \<form\> tag combines a set  
of inputs. The form provides a submission mechanism through either the Enter key on the keyboard  
or a submit input. The submission process validates the input and, if it is valid, it sends the data  
from the input as a set of key-value pairs to a specific endpoint in the server.  
To explain that in a bit more depth, let’s take a look at the following HTML code snippet, which  
defines a simple login form\:  
\<form action="/login" method="post"\>  
\<input type="email" name="email" /\>  
\<input type="password" name="password" /\>  
\<input type="submit" value="Login" /\>  
\</form\> Understanding forms in Blazor 113  
In the preceding code, we have a \<form\> tag that takes two attributes, action and method. The  
action attribute has the value /login, which is the URL of an HTTP POST endpoint on the server  
that accepts the values of the email and the password needed to process the login operation. method  
is the other attribute, and it takes the value post, which indicates the type of the HTTP request,  
which could be POST or GET.  
Inside the \<form\> tag, we have three HTML input elements. Each has its own type, name, and value  
attribute. The first one has the type email, which means it’s a text input field. It also has certain  
criteria; it has to be text input that also has to be a valid email address, so it has built-in validation.  
Also, on mobile phones, when the user taps on the input to populate its value, the mobile will provide  
a specific keyboard to input email addresses \(it has the @ button on its main keyboard, for example\).  
The name attribute of the email input defines the key in the set of the key/values that will be sent  
to the server. The server expects two properties, one called email and one called password, so  
the browser will submit the form data as a key-value pair. You can think of that just like a dictionary,  
where the word is the key and the definition is the value.  
The second input is of the password type. The browser will render it as a text field, but the input is  
hidden by default. It also has a show/hide button \(which we see in every app when we log in\).  
The third input has the type submit. The browser will render it as a button, and when the user clicks  
on it, the browser will validate all fields inside the form. If they are valid, it will submit the data to the  
defined endpoint; otherwise, it will show a list of the validation errors based on the input types and  
the values provided by the user. The submit input doesn’t need a name attribute because it will be  
used to submit the form. The other attribute that it has is the value attribute. The value attribute  
for the inputs indicates the actual value; for example, for the email input, value represents the  
email address provided as input, so if you define it in your code, the input will be shown with the  
provided value inside, but for the submit input, value is used to provide the text on the button.  
The previous form could be submitted using the Enter key after the user populates the required values.  
The keyboard’s Enter key will trigger the submission of the form just like the Submit button on the form.

link\: https\://www.w3schools.com/html/html\_form\_input\_types.asp.  
Now that you have some idea of the basics of how forms work on the web in ways that we are familiar  
with, let’s move on to how Blazor has modernized the use of forms.  
The EditForm component in Blazor  
In modern single-page applications, either using Blazor or any JavaScript framework, we have much  
more power and control over the process of forms and data submission compared to older technologies.  
Blazor provides us with a powerful component called EditForm. The EditForm component allows 114  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
us to develop a data submission form just like in our previous HTML example, but here, we have more  
control when it comes to collecting the data, as we can write some logic before the data submission  
happens and react more flexibly to the results of the form submission process.  
One of the biggest advantages of developing with C\# is that it is a powerful Object-Oriented  
Programming \(OOP\) language, which makes the development process more of a simulation of the  
real-world problem we are trying to solve with our app. So, how is OOP related to forms in Blazor?  
The answer is that the EditForm component accepts a property called Model that takes an object  
as a value, and this is the object that will be bound to the values of the input components and the  
object that will be submitted if the data is valid.  
The EditForm component provides an object of EditContext type as a cascading value based  
on the object assigned to the form. EditContext is passed as a cascading parameter to the child  
input components, and it provides functionalities to track all the metadata of the form, such as the  
values that have changed or whether they are valid or not. This enables greater flexibility in managing  
the form’s operations compared to managing forms without EditContext.  
After this little introduction, let’s go through a practical example in our BooksStore application  
to explore the basics of forms in a practical way.  
Our BooksStore application has an admin side where a user can manage the books. One of the  
essential features is to allow the admin to insert or upload a new book, so let’s go over that in this exercise\:  
1. We already have a model called Book inside the Models folder of our project that represents  
the properties of the book, but we will create a new one that will be used to submit the data of  
the book, so we will create a new class in the Models folder and call it SubmitBook.cs.  
Let’s add the following properties\:  
public class SubmitBook  
\{  
public string? Title \{ get; set; \}  
public string? Description \{ get; set; \}  
public string? Author \{ get; set; \}  
public string? ISBN \{ get; set; \}  
public int PagesCount \{ get; set; \}  
// TODO\: Other properties to be added in the next  
// sections  
\}  
2\. A new object of this class will be submitted in the next steps when the form is submitted.  
Create a new page within the Pages folder that will contain the new book form submission,  
call it BookForm.razor, set a route for it \(/book/form\), set the browser tab’s title of the  
page, and create a new @code section as follows\:  
@page "/book/form"  
\<PageTitle\>BooksStore | Add a new book\</PageTitle\> 3\. 4. Understanding forms in Blazor 115  
@\*Component UI goes here \*@  
@code  
\{  
// Component logic goes here  
\}  
Now, in the @code section, let’s define a variable of the SubmitBook class that we created  
in step 1. We will bind the form’s model to this object\:  
@code  
\{  
private SubmitBook \_book = new\(\);  
\}  
It’s now time to use the EditForm component and add some components to receive user  
input. So, let’s design and build the following form. We are going to use the default classes of  
the Bootstrap CSS framework to speed up the design process as it’s already used in the default  
template of the Blazor app\:  
...  
\<div class="row"\>  
\<div class="col-6"\>  
\<h2\>Add a new book\</h2\>  
\<EditForm Model="\_book"\>  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
\<label\>Title\</label\>  
\<input type="text"  
@bind-value="@\_book.Title"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Title" /\>  
\</div\>  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
\<label\>Description\</label\>  
\<input type="text"  
@bind-value="@\_book.Description"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Description" /\>  
\</div\>  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
\<label\>Number of pages\</label\>  
\<input type="number" @bind-  
value="@\_book.PagesCount"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Number of pages" /\>  
\</div\>  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\> 116  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
\<label\>Author\</label\>  
\<input type="text" @bind-  
value="@\_book.Author"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Author" /\>  
\</div\>  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
\<label\>Price\</label\>  
\<input type="number" @bind-  
value="@\_book.Price"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Price" /\>  
\</div\>  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
\<input type="submit"  
class="btn btn-success" value="Save"  
/\>  
\</div\>  
\</EditForm\>  
\</div\>  
\</div\>  
...  
The previous code snippet has a div element with class="row" and a nested div element  
with class="col-6". row and col-6 are two classes from Bootstrap that make the form  
50% the width of the screen. Inside these two div elements, we have an EditForm component  
with a Model parameter set to the \_book variable. The EditContext object within the  
form will use this object for validation \(more about that in the next section\) and for tracking  
changes in the input values.  
Within the form, we have a set of div blocks, each with the form-group class. This is a  
Bootstrap class that groups a form input with its label. Each block contains a label and an  
HTML input tag. Depending on the type of property we want to fill, we choose a specific type; for  
example, for the Title property, we chose text, and for PagesCount, we chose number.  
In contrast with the HTML form we created earlier, we haven’t used the name attribute of  
the input because here, we are binding each property of the \_book object to a specific value  
for the corresponding input using the @bind-value for the input element. This allows a  
two-way binding mechanism so that whenever we change the value in the input, the value of  
the property within the object gets updated and vice versa.  
The last div block contains a submit input to allow us to submit the form. The difference  
here compared to a normal HTML form is that this one won’t submit the data to the server  
and send the values as key-value pairs. Instead, three EventCallback instances are fired.  
One, called OnValidSubmit, gets fired when the form is submitted and the data is valid  
\(for this exercise, we haven’t applied validation yet\), and another one, called OnSubmit, gets Understanding forms in Blazor 117  
fired every time you submit the form whether the data is valid or not. The third one, called  
OnInvalidSubmit, fires when the form data is invalid.  
Before moving to the next point, if you run the app and navigate to /books/form, you  
should get a UI that’s similar to this\:  
5. Figure 5.1 – Add a new book form UI  
The last step in our exercise is to capture the submission of the form. This will happen when the  
user clicks the Save button or hits Enter on the keyboard, and to achieve that, we will handle  
the OnSubmit event callback provided by EditForm.  
Because we don’t have an API or any other data source yet, the submission of the form will just  
print the details entered by the user in the console window of the browser.  
In the @code section, add the following method\:  
...  
private void HandleBookFormSubmission\(\)  
\{  
Console.WriteLine\("Book has been submitted  
successfully"\);  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"Title \{\_book.Title\}"\); 118  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"Author \{\_book.Author\}"\);  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"Price \$\{\_book.Price\}"\);  
\}  
...  
Then, let’s assign the new method to the OnSubmit parameter of EditForm\:  
...  
\<h2\>Add a new book\</h2\>  
\<EditForm Model="\_book"  
OnSubmit="HandleBookFormSubmission"\>  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
...  
Now you are ready to give your app a run. Navigate to /book/form, try to fill out any data, and  
then hit Enter or the Save button. This is what you should see in your browser’s console window\:  
Figure 5.2 – Submit book form result in the console  
Now I can congratulate you on your first form! But is that everything? Well, not quite. What if the  
user doesn’t provide any data, or provides invalid values? We need a validation mechanism to help  
the user to insert valid values, but before doing that, let’s discover some built-in input components  
that make our forms more powerful.  
Note  
The method that you pass to OnSubmit, OnValidSubmit, or OnInvalidSubmit can  
accept a parameter of type EditContext. EditForm will populate that parameter and you  
can use it to control the process of submission as EditContext provides you with all the  
metadata associated with the form, such as which field has changed and whether it’s valid or not. Discovering Blazor’s built-in input components 119  
# Discovering Blazor’s built-in input components  
We have a developed our first form using HTML input elements, and everything went well, but Blazor  
has its own set of input components that give us better control and more features. In this section, we  
will discover those components and upgrade our form to be more efficient.  
The built-in input components automatically update the CSS class of the input based on the validation  
state, so we can easily apply styles for the invalid elements. We will have a closer look at that in the  
next section.  
So, let’s deep-dive into our components.  
InputText  
The first input component to visit is InputText. This gets rendered into the \<input type="text"  
/\> HTML element. Going back to our form from the previous section, we will upgrade the input of  
Title and the input of Author to use the InputText component, as shown here\:  
...  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
\<label\>Title\</label\>  
@\*\<input type="text"  
@bind-value="@\_book.Title"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Title" /\>\*@  
\<InputText @bind-Value="@\_book.Title"  
class="form-control" /\>  
\</div\>  
...  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
\<label\>Author\</label\>  
@\*\<input type="text"  
bind-value="@\_book.Author"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Author" /\>\*@  
\<InputText @bind-Value="@\_book.Author"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Author" /\>  
\</div\>  
...  
A question arises now. Why isn’t the Description field a text field? Actually, it is, but we will use  
the InputTextArea component for it. 120  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
InputTextArea  
The InputTextArea component gets translated into a \<textarea\> HTML tag, which is a multi-  
line text field, and it suits the Description field because the user may want to insert a long description.  
Back to our form, let’s upgrade the input element that is bound to the Description field of the  
book to an InputTextArea component, as shown here\:  
...  
\<label\>Description\</label\>  
@\*\<input type="text"  
@bind-value="@\_book.Description"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Description" /\>\*@  
\<InputTextArea  
@bind-Value="@\_book.Description"  
class="form-control" /\>  
...  
For our form, we still have the PagesCount and Price properties of the book, which are both  
numbers, so our next component is InputNumber.  
InputNumber\<TValue\>  
The InputNumber component has the same abilities as InputText, but it gets rendered to \<input  
type="number" /\> in HTML. It’s a generic component, which means we can provide the type of  
the value we want to deal with, such as int, double, float, decimal, and so on.  
To upgrade the input used for the PagesCount property of the book, which is of type int, we can  
set TValue to int, as shown in the following code\:  
...  
\<label\>Number of pages\</label\>  
@\*\<input type="number" @bind-value="@\_book.PagesCount"  
class="form-control" placeholder="Number of pages"/\>  
\*@  
\<InputNumber TValue="int"  
@bind-Value="@\_book.PagesCount" class="form-control"  
/\>  
...  
The Price property represents a monetary value, which in software development is usually stored  
in a variable of the decimal type, so we can upgrade it like this\:  
...  
\<label\>Price\</label\> Discovering Blazor’s built-in input components 121  
@\*\<input type="number" @bind-value="@\_book.Price"  
class="form-control" placeholder="Price" /\>\*@  
\<InputNumber TValue="decimal"  
@bind-Value="@\_book.Price" class="form-control" /\>  
...  
So far, we have upgraded all our inputs for the built-in Blazor input components. If you start the  
application and navigate to the book form page, you won’t notice a big difference. The Description  
field will have multiple lines, but if you start to enter some input, whenever you navigate from an  
input, you will notice a green border, which indicates that the value is valid.  
Figure 5.3 – Upgraded form with valid values in the inputs  
InputCheckbox  
The next component we need to know about is InputCheckbox, which is used to insert a Boolean  
value \(true/false\). It is represented as \<input type="checkbox" /\> in HTML and can be used  
like the previous inputs we have discussed \(InputText, InputNumber, InputTextArea, and  
so on\), but its value must be bound to a Boolean property, as shown in the following example, where  
IsPublished is a Boolean property\:  
\<InputCheckbox @bind-Value="\_book.IsPublished" /\> 122  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
InputDate\<TValue\>  
Date and time are two important values too, and they have their own input component in Blazor. It’s  
a generic component just like InputNumber because you can bind it to a TimeOnly, DateOnly,  
or DateTime variable type.  
It can be used as shown in the following example, where PublishingDate is of the DateOnly type\:  
\<InputDate TValue="DateOnly" @bind-Value="@\_book.PublishingDate"  
class="form-control" /\>  
InputFile  
InputFile is one of the most important input components provided by Blazor because it wraps  
complicated logic inside it to make it extremely easy for developers to read single or multiple files.  
InputFile gets rendered as the \<input type="file" /\> HTML element, but it has an  
OnChange event, which can be used to access single or multiple files selected by the user with all  
their metadata using C\#.  
The multiple attribute can be used if you want InputFile to allow the user to choose more  
than one file.  
To use InputFile, add the following component to the component section\:  
\<InputFile OnChange="OnFileSelected" /\>  
The OnFileSelected method must take a parameter of the InputFileChangedEventArgs  
type, and that type contains all the properties and methods needed to read and access the files and  
their metadata, in addition to opening a stream to read the bytes of the files.  
The following code snippet contains a method that reads a single file, prints its metadata, and gets  
access to the file stream\:  
private void OnFileSelected\(InputFileChangeEventArgs e\)  
\{  
var file = e.File;  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"File name \{file.Name\}"\);  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"File size \{file.Size\}"\);  
// Access the stream of the file  
var stream = file.OpenReadStream\(\);  
\}  
To access multiple files selected by the user, you can use the following method\:  
var allFiles = e.GetMultipleFiles\(\);  
foreach \(var item in allFiles\)  
\{ Discovering Blazor’s built-in input components 123  
// Process each file  
\}  
InputRadioGroup\<TValue\> and InputRadio\<TValue\>  
Our next component is the radio button. Radio input elements allow the user to choose a single value from  
multiple options. InputRadioGroup combines a set of InputRadio components, and the user can  
select one of the InputRadio values, which will in turn be populated through InputRadioGroup.  
Both components are also generic. You can bind any type of value to them because the user can select  
one option out of many, and this option could represent a strongly typed value in your code. This shows  
the power of Blazor and C\#, as this technique of binding a radio input to any type of value makes the  
development process much easier, and you have more power while using your own C\# types.  
The following example shows how the user can select a book type \(Ebook, Paperback, or Both\) from  
a set of radio buttons and bind that value to an enum variable.  
First, we need to create an enum that represents the book formats\:  
enum BookFormat  
\{  
Paperback,  
Ebook,  
Both  
\}  
Then, we declare a variable of the BookFormat type and give it an initial value\:  
private BookFormat \_bookFormat = BookFormat.Both;  
Within the markup section of your component file, you need to create an InputRadioGroup  
component of the BookFormat type and put three InputRadio instances of the BookFormat  
type, each representing one of the enum values\:  
\<label\>Format\</label\>  
\<InputRadioGroup TValue="BookFormat"  
@bind-Value="\_bookFormat"\>  
\<div class="row"\>  
\<div class="col-4"\>  
\<label\>Paperback\</label\>  
\<InputRadio TValue="BookFormat"  
Value="BookFormat.Paperback"  
/\>  
\</div\>  
\<div class="col-4"\>  
\<label\>E-Book\</label\> 124  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
\<InputRadio TValue="BookFormat"  
Value="BookFormat.Ebook" /\>  
\</div\>  
\<div class="col-4"\>  
\<label\>Both\</label\>  
\<InputRadio TValue="BookFormat"  
Value="BookFormat.Both" /\>  
\</div\>  
\</div\>  
\</InputRadioGroup\>  
As you may have noticed, we have bound our value or property to InputRadioGroup, and within  
it, we have three nested InputRadio instances, which take the Value parameter and represent the  
values that this radio button contains.  
InputSelect\<TValue\>  
select is a common input element in the world of software development. It represents a drop-down  
list that gives the user the ability to choose an element from a list, for example, choosing a country  
from a list of countries.  
InputSelect gets rendered to \<select\>\<option\>\</option\>...\</select\> in HTML,  
where select represents the input and the options inside refer to each value the components contain.  
It’s also a generic component; the selected value could be of any type.  
select supports choosing multiple values using multiple attributes. In addition to that, if you  
want to pre-select an option programmatically, you can use the selected attribute of \<option\>.  
The following example shows how we can add an InputSelect instance, which allows the user  
to choose the category of the book and bind the selected value into a property called Category of  
the string type\:  
\<div class="form-group"\>  
\<label\>Category\</label\>  
\<InputSelect TValue="string"  
@bind-Value="\_book.Category"  
class="form-control"\>  
\<option value=""\>Select category...\</option\>  
\<option value="web" selected\>Web\</option\>  
\<option value="mobile"\>Mobile\</option\>  
\<option value="desktop"\>Desktop\</option\>  
\<option value="cloud"\>Cloud\</option\>  
\</InputSelect\>  
\</div\> Validating form input 125  
In the preceding code snippet, you can see that we have defined the type of the select value as string.  
Then, we bound the value to the Category property, which should be of the string type too. The  
actual value that the Category property will hold is the value attribute for the selected option.  
The text between the option tags is what the user sees in the UI.  
If you run the app, you should get the following component\:  
Figure 5.4 – InputSelect component for selecting a value from multiple options  
Note  
You can see that both InputRadioGroup and InputSelect allow you to choose a value  
from multiple values, but the difference is quite large. Radio groups are used when selecting  
a single value from a small number of fixed options. On the other hand, select is used to  
choose a value or multiple values, and it’s mostly used when the number of options is large.  
On the other hand, radio buttons are more suitable where there are few options. For example,  
when asking the user for their gender, either could be used, but a radio button is more suitable  
because there are few options, but if you are asking the user to choose a country, for example,  
it would make more sense to use select.  
We have covered a wide range of input components; the next step is to make our form more efficient  
by validating the data inserted by the user, which ensures that the data received from the form is clean.  
It also helps the user to insert data that fits certain rules.  
# Validating form input  
Validating the input means checking whether the data entered in the input components satisfies a  
set of predefined rules. This process has many benefits, such as ensuring the right format of data is  
being submitted, guiding the users to put the correct values in the correct fields, and saving resources  
by preventing specific logic from happening if the data is not valid. It also prevents some malicious  
activity that could arise from certain input. 126  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
Let’s take a login page as an example. On the login page, you ask the user to enter an email address and  
password, then you check whether they are valid. The first thing to check is whether the email address  
is a valid email address and that it’s not any random text value. The same applies to the password;  
you have rules such as the minimum number of characters and different types of characters required.  
By defining these rules for the form, you ensure that you will receive the data in the correct types. It  
saves some resources by not allowing the user to submit the login request if the data is not valid. If the  
user doesn’t enter any data and there is no validation, the user can click on the login button without  
filling out the data; the form will submit the request and it will surely fail, but by validating the input  
correctly, you at least ensure that you have the correct type of input.  
Blazor supports validation using the C\# attributes and data annotations, which are sets of attributes  
that you can define at the model level. When the user submits the form, the validation component  
validates the data entered by the user against the rules you have defined on your object properties.  
The process of validation using data annotations occurs through a built-in component called  
DataAnnotationValidator, which can be placed within EditForm. By default, when the  
user submits the form, DataAnnotationsValidator accesses EditContext provided by  
the parent EditForm and checks the provided values against the rules defined in the model type  
using the data annotation attributes. After the validation process, the EditContext object will  
hold a list of the validation errors, and they can be displayed in various ways, but first, let’s update  
our SubmitBook model and add some validation rules to it\:  
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;  
public class SubmitBook  
\{  
// Title is required and value shouldn't be empty and  
// it has to be at least 3 characters long and at most  
// 80 characters long  
\[Required\]  
\[StringLength\(80, MinimumLength = 3\)\]  
public string Title \{ get; set; \} = string.Empty;  
// Description is optional but it must be at most 5000  
// characters long  
\[StringLength\(5000\)\]  
public string? Description \{ get; set; \}  
// Author is required and value shouldn't be empty and  
// it has to be at least 3 characters long and at most  
// 80 characters long  
\[Required\]  
\[StringLength\(80, MinimumLength = 3\)\] Validating form input 127  
public string Author \{ get; set; \} = string.Empty;  
\[Range\(typeof\(decimal\), "0", "99999"\)\] // price decimal  
// value must be between 0 and 99999  
public decimal Price \{ get; set; \}  
\[Range\(0, 9999\)\] // int value must be between 0 and  
// 9999  
public int PagesCount \{ get; set; \}  
// TODO\: Other properties to be added in the next  
// sections  
\}  
Those added attributes are all you need to build your validation logic. To make the form apply these  
rules before submission, we just need to add the DataAnnotationsValidator component  
within EditForm in the BookForm.razor file in addition to using the OnValidSubmit event  
callback. We should avoid using OnSubmit, as it will trigger the HandleBookFormSubmission  
method even if the inserted data is not valid. Thus, our validation logic should look as follows\:  
...  
\<EditForm Model="\_book" OnValidSubmit="HandleBookFormSubmission"\>  
\<DataAnnotationsValidator /\>  
...  
DataAnnotationsValidator can access the EditContext object of the form  
because the EditForms object supplies it to all its children as a cascading value. Thus,  
DataAnnotationsValidator can access the modified values entered in the form and compare  
them with the rules defined in the type of the object that’s supplied to the Model property of EditForm.  
Now, if you run the application and try to submit the form directly without inserting the correct data,  
the HandleBookFormSubmission function won’t be triggered because the form is not valid, but  
the user cannot see what’s wrong with it.  
We have two ways to list all the validation errors for the user\: either we use a component called  
ValidationsSummary, which lists all the errors, or we can use the ValidationMessage  
component, which shows the validation error for each specific property.  
First, let’s try to use the ValidationsSummary component by inserting it below the  
\<DataAnnotationsValidator\> component, as shown here\:  
...  
\<EditForm Model="\_book" OnValidSubmit ="HandleBookFormSubmission"\>  
\<DataAnnotationsValidator /\>  
\<ValidationSummary /\>  
... 128  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
It’s as simple as that. Let’s run the app and try to submit the form without filling in the data correctly.  
You should see a list of red messages that explain what’s wrong with the data inside the form\:  
Figure 5.5 – Form submission validation result for invalid input  
That’s cool, right? You can also see that the outline of the field automatically turns red if the input is not  
valid. That’s because the built-in input components attach a CSS class called invalid to the input,  
which styles the invalid components, and the default red border comes from Bootstrap.  
ValidationSummary does a good job listing all the validation errors, but it would be better if we  
had the validation message below each input field. To do that, we can use the ValidationMessage  
component, which only shows the error for a specific property using the For parameter, as shown here\:  
...  
\<InputText @bind-Value="@\_book.Title" class="form-control" /\>  
\<ValidationMessage For="\(\) =\> \_book.Title" /\>  
...  
Now we test the app again. In addition to the list of errors at the top of the form, you will see a red  
message below the Title input field, as shown here\: Developing a custom input component 129  
Figure 5.6 – ValidationMessage for single input field output  
That looks much better. Now we will comment out the ValidationSummary component and use  
ValidationMessage for each field to make the rest of the form look better.  
The last point to mention on the topic of validation is the name of the property. Back in Figure 5.5,  
the third validation error refers to PagesCount, which is a programmatical name. If we want to use  
a more user-friendly name, in the validation annotations on the SubmitBook model, we can use  
an attribute called DisplayName, or we can even customize the full error message by setting the  
value of the ErrorMessage property of the attribute, as shown here in the SubmitBook.cs file\:  
...  
\[DisplayName\("Number of Pages"\)\]  
\[Range\(0, 9999, ErrorMessage = "Number of pages must be at least 0 and  
at most 9999"\)\] // int value must be between 0  
// and 9999  
public int PagesCount \{ get; set; \}  
...  
So far, we have got an advanced form that looks good and validates the input with a set of logical rules  
that make our form more efficient and provide a better user experience.  
The next milestone is getting to know the APIs provided by Blazor, which allow us to develop our  
own customized input component in case the inputs mentioned in the previous section don’t fulfill  
all our needs.  
# Developing a custom input component  
Blazor contains a class called InputBase\<T\>, which is the base class for all the input components  
that we have seen so far. The great thing about this class is that we can use it to develop our own input  
component with the same specifications as the built-in ones.  
InputBase\<T\> has a method called TryParseValueFromString, which is the main method  
that we need to override, and this is where we can locate the logic that processes the string of the input  
and translates it into something more meaningful. There is also a property called CurrentValue,  
which we can use to bind our insider input to. 130  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
Blazor already has an InputDate component that gets rendered to an input tag of the date type  
in HTML, so in the next example, we are going to create a custom component called InputTime,  
which will be translated to the input tag of the time type. We can bind a TimeOnly value to it.  
Let’s get started\:  
1\. 2. Within the BooksStore.Blazor.Components Razor Class Library project, add a new  
component file and call it InputTime.razor. We have added the component to the Razor  
Class Library project to enable reusability.  
Our component should inherit from InputBase, which exists in the Microsoft.  
AspNetCore.Components.Forms namespace, and we can set its type to TimeOnly.  
We need to implement the TryParseValueFromString method, as shown here\:  
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms;  
@inherits InputBase\<TimeOnly\>  
@code \{  
protected override bool TryParseValueFromString\(  
string value, out TimeOnly result, out string  
validationErrorMessage\)  
\{  
\}  
\}  
3. Add an HTML input element of the time type and bind its value to the CurrentValue  
property available in InputBase, and also set the value of the class attribute to the  
CssClass property, as follows\:  
...  
\<input type="time" @bind-value="@CurrentValue" class="@  
CssClass"/\>  
...  
4. We just need to write the logic of TryParseValueFromString to translate the string  
value into a TimeOnly value of the output parameter result. Before we do that, we need  
to make sure that value is not empty; otherwise, we return false and populate the  
validationErrorMessage output parameter with a message that indicates that the  
process is invalid\:  
protected override bool TryParseValueFromString\(string? value,  
out TimeOnly result, out string validationErrorMessage\)  
\{  
if \(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace\(value\)\)  
\{  
validationErrorMessage = "Invalid time value";  
return false; Developing a custom input component 131  
\}  
result = TimeOnly.Parse\(value\);  
validationErrorMessage = null;  
return true;  
\}  
5. To test our new component, we can go back to SubmitBook.razor and add the new input we  
just created. Then, we can bind its Value to a variable of the TimeOnly type, as shown here\:  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
\<label\>Time\</label\>  
@\*\<input type="number"  
@bind-value="@\_book.Price"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Price" /\>\*@  
\<BooksStore.Blazor.Components  
.InputTime  
@bind-Value="@\_time"  
class="form-control" /\>  
\<p\>Selected time is @\_time\</p\>  
\</div\>  
...  
@code  
\{  
...  
Private TimeOnly \_time = new TimeOnly\(12, 30, 0\);  
...  
\}  
That’s everything we need to do. We have developed our own input class, which can be used just like  
InputDate, InputText, InputSelect, and others mentioned earlier, so let’s run the app and  
see the final result of our work\:  
Figure 5.7 – The InputTime component rendered in the UI  
Because it’s an input of the time type, every browser has its own time picker so the user can easily  
choose the time. Also, as you have seen, it’s a two-way binding input. By default, the \_time variable  
is set to 12\:30\:00, and that’s reflected directly in the input. Also, whenever you change the input value,  
the variable will be updated too. 132  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation  
With that, you have seen another powerful capability of Blazor, which is the InputBase class,  
which we have used to develop a full input component with very few lines of code and is just like a  
native component.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we have covered some important topics in client-side software development\: forms, data  
submission, and validation. We went over the basic definitions of forms and introduced the EditForm  
component in Blazor. Then, we reviewed the built-in input components in Blazor. After that, we covered  
the concept of validation and the DataAnnotationsValidator, ValidationSummary, and  
ValidationMessage components. Finally, we showed an example of how to develop our own  
custom input component. With these topics covered, you should have learned the following\:  
•  
Why we need forms and how they work  
•  
How to develop a basic form using the EditForm component in Blazor  
•  
How to use the built-in input components available in Blazor  
•  
How to validate the input of the user using data annotation validators and view the result in the UI  
•  
How to develop a custom input component for advanced cases where the built-in components  
aren’t suitable  
In the next chapter, we will continue our journey by working with JavaScript hand in hand with Blazor,  
seeing why and when to use it and how to achieve two-way communication between C\# and JavaScript.

# Consuming JavaScript in Blazor  
By this point, we have developed components to render data and capture the user’s input and written  
logic and navigate between pages, all purely with C\#, and that’s the big promise of Blazor. But a little  
bit of JavaScript is kind of needed in some cases.  
Throughout this chapter, we are going to discover those cases with some real-world examples, along  
with the IJSRuntime interface, which is a Blazor built-in service that allows communication between  
C\# and JavaScript and vice versa.

Consuming JavaScript in Blazor  
# When and why we use JavaScript in Blazor apps  
The main selling point of Blazor is that it lets us build modern web applications using C\# instead of  
JavaScript and that’s 100% true, but the presence of capabilities in the browser that have been built  
around JavaScript for many years makes the use of JavaScript mandatory in some cases.  
Blazor already uses JavaScript behind the scenes in its engine, for example, to manipulate the Document  
Object Model \(DOM\), access some special features in the browser such as local storage, and even  
deal with files.  
Because of the length of use of JavaScript in web development compared to Blazor, there are thousands  
of packages and tools that have been built using JavaScript over the years by corporates and open  
source contributors, including rich text editors, image croppers, and stuff like that. Having the ability  
to communicate with JavaScript from Blazor gives you the power to leverage those utilities directly  
out of the box instead of having to rewrite them in C\#.  
I have been using Blazor in my daily work for two and half years at the time of writing this book. The  
JavaScript code that I have written is minimal but nonetheless crucial, mostly used to wrap existing  
JavaScript libraries to be able to use them in my apps.  
For example, I wrote a wrapper to integrate with the payment gateway Stripe \(https\://stripe.  
com\). Stripe provides a collection of pre-built payment-related web elements called StripeJS, so I  
had the choice of either writing a little JS code and taking advantage of all its powerful elements, or  
writing my own from scratch using C\# – of course, I chose to use a bit of JS.  
Other times, you need just a tiny bit of JS code, only 2-3 lines, to perform some function against the  
DOM or trigger an event that has to be done using JavaScript. One small example here is the famous  
“scroll to the top from the bottom of the page” functionality that you can find on almost any lengthy  
web or app page. When you click this button, it scrolls the page back to the top. To achieve that  
behavior, a couple of lines of JS are required.  
Fortunately, Blazor makes it extremely easy to enable this communication with JS in two ways, from C\#  
to JS and from JS to C\#, using the IJSRuntime interface that we can inject and get straight to work.  
IJSRuntime interface in Blazor  
Blazor has a built-in service that enables communication with JS called IJSRuntime, which is used  
by injecting it into any component or service when needed.  
IJSRuntime has a generic C\# method called InvokeAsync that takes as parameters the name of  
the JS function to be called and the set of parameters to be passed to the JS method. If the JS method  
returns any data, you can define the type of the data while calling the function. For example, if the JS  
method returns a string message, the method can be called as follows\:  
var messageFromJs = InvokeAsync\<string\>\("SayHello", "Blazor  
WebAssembly"\); When and why we use JavaScript in Blazor apps 135  
The other method to use is InvokeVoidAsync. This method has the exact same purpose as InvokeAsync  
but it’s used to call a JS method that doesn’t return data.  
Blazor already takes care of serializing or deserializing the data passed to and from the JS code. For  
example, if the JS code requires a complex object of type book, in the C\# code you just pass your book  
object as is, and Blazor will serialize it into a JSON object and pass it to the JS code on its own. The  
same applies when the JS code returns any kind of object \(string, number, Book, etc.\) – you can  
just define the type in C\# too, as usual, without worrying how the JavaScript will become a C\# object.  
Before we get started writing some code that interpolates with JS, let’s understand first the possible  
ways to reference a JS file in our applications.  
Referencing JS globally  
Basically, to call any JS method, the JS file that contains the method has to be referenced in your  
application. The traditional and preferred way is to reference the file in the index.html file of the  
app, which makes all the methods of the JS file accessible from any component.  
Let’s see practically how we can achieve that\:  
1\. 2. In the wwwroot folder of the application, create a new JS file named site.js.  
We will write a little function that shows an alert in the browser. We will call it showAlert\(name\),  
and the method will take a name as a parameter and then print a greeting for a user whenever  
we call this method\:  
function showAlert\(name\) \{  
alert\('Hello ' + name\);  
\}  
3. To be able to call the previous method, we need to reference the site.js file, so in the index.  
html page, add a \<script\> tag with the path of the file as shown here\:  
\<!DOCTYPE html\>  
\<html lang="en"\>  
...  
\<body\>  
...  
\<script src="site.js"\>\</script\>  
\</body\>  
\</html\>  
With that, the showAlert method can be called anytime from any component whenever we need  
it, as we will see in the Calling JavaScript from C\# code section. 136  
Consuming JavaScript in Blazor  
JS isolation in Blazor  
In .NET 5.0, Blazor introduces the concept of JS and CSS isolation. Essentially, we have the ability to  
write some JS methods and access them on demand only through a specific scope of a JS object, and  
the JS resources will be loaded only when needed.  
To see how this works in brief, create a new JS file in the wwwroot folder and give it the name  
scripts.js. Inside it, we will create a method called getRandomBook that returns a book object\:  
export function getRandomBook\(\) \{  
// Return a JSON object with similar properties to our  
// C\# book model existing in the models folder  
return \{  
title\: 'Mastering Blazor WebAssembly',  
author\: 'Ahmad Mozaffar',  
price\: 49.99  
\}  
\}  
As you can see, the function is marked with export so it can be imported into a JS module.  
To use that function, we don’t need to reference the JS file in index.html; we can import it exactly  
where we want to use it.  
In the next section, we will use the isolated JS technique to call the method we just created to demonstrate  
how to call JS methods that return data.  
# Calling JavaScript from C\# code  
Now that we have learned why we need JS and the possible ways to reference it, it’s time to get some  
JS code executed by our Blazor app. We will cover three different scenarios\:  
•  
•  
•  
Calling a basic JS method  
Calling a JS method synchronously  
Calling a JS method that returns data  
Calling a basic JS method  
In the previous section, we created the site.js file that contains the showAlert function. In the  
following exercise, we will call that function from the NavBar component where we will add a new  
Login button on the top-right side of our app. Calling JavaScript from C\# code 137  
For now, this button will show an alert, but later we will use it for authentication purposes\:  
1. In the Shared folder, open the NavBar component and add a button with its own div, so  
by default, the button will show on the right-hand side of the page\:  
\<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"\>  
...  
\<div class="d-flex"\>  
\<button class="btn btn-outline-primary"\>  
Login\</button\>  
\</div\>  
\</div\>  
\</nav\>  
2. To call the JS method, we need to inject the IJSRuntime interface at the top of the component  
file as follows\:  
@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime  
...  
3. Add a code section and a method that will call the JS showAlert method created earlier.  
We will use the InvokeVoidAsync method as the showAlert JS method doesn’t return  
any data. Otherwise, we should use InvokeAsync and pass to it the name of the JS method,  
along with another parameter, that is, the name parameter that the JS method expects from us\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
private async Task ShowAlertAsync\(\)  
\{  
await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync\("showAlert",  
"Unkown user"\);  
\}  
\}  
4. By default, JS interop calls are all asynchronous no matter what the JS method does internally.  
That’s why we added the async/await keywords to our C\# method.  
Allow the method we just created to be called when we click on the new Login button by using  
the @onclick event in the \<button\> tag\:  
\<button class="btn btn-outline-primary" @  
onclick="ShowAlertAsync"\>Login\</button\>  
Now, if you run the app and click on the Login button at the top right, you should see a native alert  
shown in the browser with a message reading Hello Unknown user\: 138  
Consuming JavaScript in Blazor  
Figure 6.1 – Native browser alert  
Calling a JS method synchronously  
Blazor WebAssembly provides the ability to call C\# methods synchronously. This allows for better  
control and performance in some special scenarios.  
When calling a method asynchronously, the app will wait until the method finishes execution before  
proceeding to the following steps. However, a synchronous call will trigger the JS method and let it  
run in the background while proceeding to the following steps in the execution.  
A great real-world use case of this is tracking events in your app. This tracking can be achieved by  
integrating a usage analytics platform such as Google Analytics into your app to track how the users  
are using your app. For every function the user performs in the UI, your app will send telemetry data  
to Google Analytics to track a specific event, and this data is sometimes sent for every mouse move.  
So, it doesn’t make sense to execute those methods to send the telemetries asynchronously and keep  
the app waiting until the JS call is complete and the request has been fully sent to Google Analytics  
before proceeding with your app logic.  
Lets get back to our previous exercise, where we will just alter the line that calls the JS method  
to make it execute the call synchronously. All we need to do is cast the IJSRuntime type into  
IJSInProcessRuntime and make the C\# method synchronous too by removing the async/  
await code as shown in the following code\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
private void ShowAlert\(\)  
\{  
var jsInProcess = \(IJSInProcessRuntime\)JSRuntime;  
jsInProcess.InvokeVoid\("showAlert", "Unkown user"\);  
\}  
\} Calling JavaScript from C\# code 139  
Of course, don’t forget to change the assigned function for the @onclick event of the button to  
ShowAlert instead of ShowAlertAsync.  
Running the preceding code will lead to the exact same result, but the result may differ if your JS code  
is making some API calls as in the Google Analytics example.  
Note  
If your app is a pure Blazor WebAssembly app, you can safely cast IJSRuntime to the  
IJSInProcessRuntime instance. However, if your code will also be used as a Blazor Server  
app, then it will fail because Blazor Server runs on a server and requires a network connection  
to be able to execute the JS method, so it doesn’t support synchronous calls.  
Calling a JS method that returns data  
So far, we have used the InvokeVoidAsync method to call a JS method that doesn’t return  
anything. Next, we will go over an exercise that calls a JS method that returns an object and see how  
we can use it in C\#.  
The following exercise demonstrates a JS method that returns a JSON object representing a book.  
We will be using the isolated JS technique to get access to the required JS method. So, let’s kick it off\:  
1\. 2. In the JS isolation in Blazor section earlier in this chapter, we created the scripts.js file,  
which contains an exportable method called getRandomBook.  
Open the Index component that will call this method to retrieve the book object. Inject the  
IJSRuntime interface at the top\:  
@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime  
...  
3. Now we can write the code to call the method, but to do so, we need to load the JS module  
that holds the getRandomBook method. Because we are using the isolated approach, the  
getRandomBook method is not available for calling directly. First, we need to load its module  
and then call it from the module object in the OnInitializedAsync method, as shown  
in the following code\:  
...  
protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
// Call the JS import and pass the path of the  
// external js path that will be placed in the  
// wwwroot folder that will load only the JS  
// code of the requested component  
var module = await  
JSRuntime.InvokeAsync\<IJSObjectReference\> 140  
Consuming JavaScript in Blazor  
\("import",  
"./\_content/BooksStore/Index.razor.js"\);  
// From the module JS object, we can call the  
// getRandomBook\(\) method  
var randomBook = await  
module.InvokeAsync\<Book\>\("getRandomBook"\);  
...  
As you may have noticed, when using InvokeAsync we have to define the type that we  
expect from the JS call. For the first call, we returned IJSObjectReference because this  
is how we import a JS module in an isolated fashion. In the second one, we used the type Book  
because the object that the getRandomBook\(\) method retrieves has the same properties  
as our Book object.  
Now the randomBook variable has the properties passed from JS and can be used normally in C\#.  
# Calling C\# from JS  
When building software, a different means of communication between C\# and JavaScript is required\:  
calling C\# methods from within JS code.  
A good example of this is when you are trying to embed a pre-built JS library in your application,  
such as an image cropper or a rich text editor. In some cases, you want your app to react to changes  
that happen in those packages, so whenever a certain event occurs inside them, you need to fire  
a method in your C\# code, for example, showing the dimension of the new image that the user is  
cropping using that JS utility.  
Another example is reacting to some window changes in your app, such as when the user is resizing  
the window of the browser and you need to change some behaviors in your app. Maybe you have a list  
of emails and when the user clicks on one, it renders the email on the right-hand side. But if the user  
resizes the screen to make it smaller, you need the list of emails to be shown on its own page and when  
one email is selected, the app will redirect the user to a separate new page that will render the email.  
Basically, it’s not very common to implement the approach of calling C\# from JS. In my 2.5 years of  
Blazor development I only had to do it once, while I was integrating a JS package called GoJS, one of  
the best libraries in the world to draw charts and diagrams. I used C\# to JS to render the chart and  
set its properties using its own JS methods, but I wanted to fire some events in C\# when, for example,  
the user right-clicked on a node in the diagram or even dragged and dropped something. For that  
use case, I had to use some JS to C\#.  
The Blazor community is huge and it’s just getting bigger, but in the early days it was very common  
to write your own JS as it wasn’t guaranteed that you would find the thing you were trying to resolve  
already handled by someone else. Now, it’s totally different\: the Blazor community is very rich and the  
libraries available out there cover many of our needs, especially concerning JS interop. Calling C\# from JS 141  
There are two ways of executing C\# methods from JS, either calling a static C\# method or calling a  
method of an object.  
Calling a static C\# method  
Calling a static C\# method is extremely easy. Blazor has an attribute called \[JSInvokable\] that  
we can use to decorate the required C\# method so we can call it from a JS method.  
If we decorate the method with \[JSInvokable\] alone, we can call the method using its name  
from JS, but \[JSInvokable\] takes a string as a parameter so we can give it an alias that we use  
when we call from it JS.  
Let’s go over an example and see this in action\:  
1\. 2. In the root directory of the project, create a demo class named JsSample.cs.  
Create a static C\# method that will just return the sum of two numbers and decorate it with  
the \[JSInvokable\] attribute as follows\:  
using Microsoft.JSInterop;  
public class JsSample  
\{  
\[JSInvokable\]  
public static int Sum\(int firstNumber,  
int secondNumber\)  
\{  
return firstNumber + secondNumber;  
\}  
\}  
To give a method an alias you can use the attribute as shown here\:  
\[JSInvokable\("AddTwoNumbers"\)\]  
3. In the site.js file, add a function named callCsharpMethod and add the following  
piece of code to it\:  
function callStaticCsharpMethod\(\) \{  
await DotNet.invokeMethodAsync\('BooksStore', 'Sum',

Consuming JavaScript in Blazor  
DotNet is a built-in object in Blazor JS. The parameters passed to invokeMethodAsync  
respectively include BookStore, which is the name of the assembly that contains the static  
method; Sum, which is the name of the method or the alias name based on what you have  
chosen; and 3 and 5, which are the parameters required by the C\# method.  
After the C\# method gets called successfully, you can use the .then\(\) method to do after-  
call processing. The data parameter holds the output of the C\# method and you can use that  
data within the body for any kind of logic you want. You can also call .catch\(\) to handle  
any unexpected errors that could arise.  
If you call the JS method somewhere in the app, as output it will print 3 + 5 = 8 in the browser’s  
console window.  
Note  
The DotNet object in Blazor JS provides two methods\: invokeMethod and  
invokeMethodAsync. The synchronous version is supported only in Blazor WebAssembly  
and that’s why it’s preferable to use the asynchronous method inovkeMethodAsync as it’s  
supported in Blazor Server and WebAssembly.  
Calling an instance C\# method  
To call an instance method, the name of the method is not enough – we need to pass the .NET object  
that contains that method, so it will be called for that specific object.  
To achieve that, we need to pass the .NET object to the JS method, which is done by wrapping that  
instance with an object of type DotNetObjectReference\<ObjectType\> where ObjectType  
is the type of the instance we will pass to the JS code.  
In the following exercise, we will simulate a real-world scenario where we will use the DataListView  
component we created in Chapter 3, Developing Advanced Components in Blazor. The DataListView  
component rendered a list of books in rows and columns, and we will add a method that will be  
triggered whenever the user resizes the browser window. This gives the developer a new capability  
based on responsiveness\:  
1. Open the DataListView.razor file in the Shared folder of the project. Then, inject  
the IJSRuntime interface, and implement the IDisposable interface at the top of the  
component file\:  
...  
@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime  
@implements IDisposable  
... 2\. 3. 4. Calling C\# from JS 143  
In the @code section, create a new variable of type  
DotNetObjectReference\<DataListView\<ItemType\>\>. Then, in  
OnInitalizedAsync, create its value using the Create method as follows\:  
...  
private DotNetObjectReference\<DataListView  
\<ItemType\>\>? \_dotNetObjectReference;  
protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
\_dotNetObjectReference =  
DotNetObjectReference.Create\(this\);  
\}  
...  
Basically, this object wraps the actual object we want to pass to the JS code, because the object  
we want to send is an instance of the DataListView\<ItemType\> type that will contain  
the required method we want to trigger.  
Before we proceed with the rest of the logic, we need to call the Dispose method on  
\_dotNetObjectReference when the component gets disposed to avoid any memory  
leaks that could occur. Because we are implementing the IDisposable interface, simply  
create a little method called Dispose as follows\:  
...  
public void Dispose\(\)  
\{  
\_dotNetObjectReference.Dispose\(\);  
\}  
...  
Create a method and give it the name OnWindowResized. This method takes two int  
parameters, one for the width and the other for the height, and of course, we need to decorate  
it with the \[JSInvokeable\] attribute\:  
...  
\[JSInvokable\]  
public void OnWindowResized\(int width, int height\)  
\{  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"New width \{width\} and the  
new height \{height\}"\);  
\}  
... 144  
Consuming JavaScript in Blazor  
5. This method will be fired from the JS code whenever the user resizes the window. We can  
include many actions inside it, such as rearranging some elements in the UI, showing/hiding  
some elements, and so on, but to keep things simple, we will just print the new width and height  
passed from JS in the console window of the browser.  
Back to the site.js file that contains the JS functions we have created so far. Create a new  
method in site.js that will subscribe to the onresize event and trigger the .NET function  
whenever the event occurs\:  
...  
function triggerOnWindowResized\(dotnetObjRef\) \{  
// Subscribe to the window.onresize event and  
// trigger a method that will trigger the .NET  
// method and pass the width and height as  
// parameters to it  
window.onresize = function \(\) \{  
dotnetObjRef.invokeMethodAsync\('OnWindowResized',  
window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight\);  
\}  
\}  
6. The method takes a dotnetObjRef object that we will pass to it in the next step. Then  
it will subscribe to window.onresize, and whenever that event gets fired we will  
invoke the OnWindowResized method in the DataListView component by using  
invokeMethodAsync. We will pass to it the name of the method to execute and the  
parameters we want to pass, which in this case are the current width and height of the window.  
For the last step, we need to call this JS method, which will call the OnWindowResized method.  
So, in the DataListView.razor file within the OnInitializedAsync method, call the  
triggerOnWindowResized JS method after creating the dotNetObjectReference  
as follows\:  
...  
protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
\_dotNetObjectReference =  
DotNetObjectReference.Create\(this\);  
// Call the triggerOnWindowResized JS method  
await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync\(  
"triggerOnWindowResized",  
\_dotNetObjectReference\);  
\}  
...  
That’s the lot. Now, because we are using this component on the index page, if we run the app and  
try to resize the window, we will notice every time the window size changes, some text will appear to  
show the new width and height in the console window, as follows\: Turning an existing JS package into a reusable Blazor component 145  
Figure 6.2 – C\# method called from JS code when the window gets resized  
Note  
Most of the common operations that you will need are already available as NuGet packages  
created by the community that you can use out of the box. Still, learning how to achieve them  
yourself will give you more flexibility and control over the development process.  
So far, we have seen many possibilities and techniques for communication between Blazor and JS. In  
the next section, we will work through a real-world scenario of importing an existing JS library and  
integrating it with our app.  
# Turning an existing JS package into a reusable Blazor  
# component  
JS is extremely rich in open source libraries that have been around for years and solve many scenarios.  
One important utility you will need in almost every app is a rich text editor. The normal text input  
we have in HTML only allows the user to type plain text, but with a rich text editor, the user can style  
their content and make it more organized and aesthetically pleasing. 146  
Consuming JavaScript in Blazor  
In the app we are developing, we have built a form so the admin can submit a new book. In this form  
is a description field where the user can describe the book. In this section, we are going to leverage  
an open source JS library that will give us a Markdown editor that is both easy and beautiful to allow  
an admin writing a book description to style it and add titles, sections, and even menus.  
The library is called SimpleMDE – Markdown Editor and is available on GitHub under the MIT  
license. You can find it at the following link\: https\://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-  
markdown-editor. We need to write a few lines of JS to make it Blazor-ready, and because we  
can use it in other apps as well, we are going to place it in the Razor Class Library project  
BooksStore.Components. So, let’s get started\:  
1. The library has a reference for its JS file and CSS styles that we can get from its CDN servers.  
We will place them in the index.html file of the main project as shown\:  
\<!DOCTYPE html\>  
\<html lang="en"\>  
\<head\>  
...  
\<link rel="stylesheet"  
href="https\://cdn.jsdelivr.net/simplemde/latest  
/simplemde.min.css"\>  
\</head\>  
\<body\>  
...  
\<script  
src="https\://cdn.jsdelivr.net/simplemde/latest  
/simplemde.min.js"\>\</script\>  
\</body\>  
\</html\>  
2. Now, in the BooksStore.Components project, create a new file within the wwwroot  
folder and call it blazor-simplemde.js. Inside this file, write the following simple JS  
function, which will initialize the first \<textarea\> input in the HTML and turn it into a  
full Markdown editor\:  
var simplemde;  
function initializeMarkdownEditor\(\) \{  
simplemde = new SimpleMDE\(\);  
\}  
I have taken the third line in the previous snippet from the library’s documentation, where you  
can read more about this and see more advanced ways to initialize text editor input. 3\. 4. Turning an existing JS package into a reusable Blazor component 147  
Because the text editor will be transformed into a totally new utility, we need two JS methods.  
One will read the content from inside the editor and the other will set the content inside it\:  
...  
function getMarkdownEditorValue\(\) \{  
if \(simplemde != null\)  
return simplemde.value\(\);  
return '';  
\}  
function setMarkdownEditorValue\(value\) \{  
if \(simplemde != null\)  
simplemde.value\(value\);  
\}  
Create a new component in the BooksStore.Components project named BlazorSimpleMde.  
razor. This will be a custom component that will render a \<textarea\> HTML tag and  
will contain two functions to get and set the content. We use get and set methods because the  
values are being read from JS\:  
@using Microsoft.JSInterop;  
@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime  
\<textarea\>\</textarea\>  
@code \{  
protected override async Task  
OnAfterRenderAsync\(bool firstRender\)  
\{  
if \(firstRender\)  
\{  
await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync\(  
"initializeMarkdownEditor"\);  
\}  
\}  
public async Task\<string\> GetEditorValueAsync\(\)  
\{  
return await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync\<string\>\(  
"getMarkdownEditorValue"\);  
\}  
\}  
In the preceding code, we have injected the IJSRuntime interface, then added a \<textarea\>  
tag that will be replaced by the Markdown editor. In the @code section, we have overridden  
OnAfterRenderAsync and called the initializeMarkdownEditor function from  
JS within if to check whether this is the first render. Here, we are using OnAfterRender  
to make sure that the HTML of the component is completely rendered because the HTML is  
not yet available in the OnInitialized lifecycle event.  
After that, we added a method that returns a string that calls the getMarkdownEditorValue  
JS method to retrieve the string content of the editor. 148  
Consuming JavaScript in Blazor  
5. Now, it’s time to use the BlazorSimpleMde component in the BookForm component.  
Back in the BooksStores project, open the index.html file and add a reference to the  
JS file that we created. Append it to the end of the script section\:  
...  
\<script src="\_Content/BooksStore.Blazor.Components/blazor-  
simplemde.js"\>\</script\>  
\</body\>  
6. Open the BookForm.razor file from the Pages folder, and add a @using to add the  
namespace of the components project\:  
@page "/book/form"  
@using BooksStore.Blazor.Components;  
...  
7. Within the form, replace the \<InputTextArea\> component with the \<BlazorSimpleMde  
/\> component\:  
...  
\<div class="form-group mt-1"\>  
\<label\>Description\</label\>  
@\*\<input type="text"  
@bind-value="@\_book.Description"  
class="form-control"  
placeholder="Description" /\>\*@  
\<BlazorSimpleMde @ref="\_simpleMde"/\>  
\<ValidationMessage For="\(\) =\>  
\_book.Description" /\>  
\</div\>  
...  
8\. But because this one is not a native input component, we cannot use the binding mechanism  
for it. We need to fetch the value manually.  
As you will have noticed, we created a method inside the BlazorSampleMde component  
to fetch the value from the editor, but here we are going to call a method inside a component.  
This is something new for us and we will achieve it using the @ref Razor attribut Turning an existing JS package into a reusable Blazor component 149  
Basically, every Blazor component in the UI is a normal C\# object. Blazor provides the @ref  
attribute, which gives us access from the C\# code to that instance of the component. So, in this  
step, we will create a C\# variable of type BlazorSimpleMde, which we will use later in the  
GetEditorValueAsync\(\) method\:  
...  
private BlazorSimpleMde \_simpleMde;  
...  
9\. To populate the value of the BlazorSimpleMde instance we need to assign it to the @ref  
attribute of the \<BlazorSimpleMde\> component in the markup section\:  
...  
\<BlazorSimpleMde @ref="\_simpleMde"/\>  
...  
10. The last step is to fetch the value and populate it in the \_book.Description property.  
We can do this in the HandleBookFormSubmission method we created in Chapter 5,  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation, by calling the GetEditorValueAsync  
from the \_simpleMde instance, and of course we need to mark the method as async because  
GetEditorValueAsync is an asynchronous method\:  
...  
private BlazorSimpleMde \_simpleMde;  
private async void HandleBookFormSubmission\(\)  
\{  
\_book.Description = await  
\_simpleMde.GetEditorValueAsync\(\);  
Console.WriteLine\("Book has been submitted  
successfully"\);  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"Title \{\_book.Title\}"\);  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"Author \{\_book.Author\}"\);  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"Price \$\{\_book.Price\}"\);  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"Description  
\{\_book.Description\}"\);  
\}  
...  
That’s everything – now we can run the app and navigate to /Book/Form and you will notice that  
the Description field has a big, advanced text editor that gives the admin user great flexibility when  
populating the description of the book before publishing it\: 150

As you have seen, the main language to build your apps with is C\#, but whenever you need anything  
from JavaScript, Blazor has you covered. It puts you in a powerful position where you can leverage all  
your .NET skills to build rich and modern applications in addition to taking full advantage of what  
JS offers, all in one place.  
# Summary  
With what we’ve covered in this chapter, you should be equipped with all the knowledge and experience  
you need to deal with anything JS related in your application, be it taking advantage of some built-in  
JS capabilities or using pre-built packages in your app with ease.  
Throughout this chapter, we have learned why and when to use JavaScript in our Blazor WebAssembly  
application. We discovered the possible ways to implement interaction between the two languages  
in both directions. To put everything together and show you how you can leverage JavaScript to its  
full potential in your app, we ended up importing an open source library, wrapping it, and making it  
Blazor-ready so we can use it just like any other Blazor component. Further reading 151  
By completing this chapter, you should now be able to do the following\:  
•  
Identify the purpose of JS in Blazor  
•  
Detect when it’s necessary to use some JS in your apps  
•

# Managing Application State  
While a user is using an app, there is a high probability that the user will close the browser by mistake,  
move to another app, or even expect the app to be in the same flow after refreshing the page or opening  
the link in another tab.  
Managing state is about keeping your app and the user experience consistent, bulletproof, and enjoyable.  
It’s about keeping track of what the user was doing, even if something unexpected happens.  
This chapter teaches you about state management, and the various ways to store and transfer this state,  
either by using local storage, the URL, or in-memory solutions.  
While learning about state management techniques, we will apply them directly to our BooksStore  
project to preserve the state of the navigated page on the Index page. In addition, we will learn how  
to keep the state of the new book form, so that if the admin device faced an issue and the app closed  
suddenly, when the admin navigates to the form again, the entered data will stay there.  
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics\:  
•

Persisting the state in the memory

Managing Application State  
# What is state management?  
When consumers use your software, they perform certain tasks that the application enables, such as  
adding items to a shopping cart, filling in forms, dragging events to a calendar, and more. These kinds  
of tasks produce data, and this data can be stored permanently \(in a database on the server via an API;  
you can learn more about that in detail in Chapter 8, Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly\)  
or we can hold this state temporarily in a local source. In this chapter, we are focusing on the second  
option, which is storing the data temporarily, but before we proceed with doing that, let’s understand  
the difference between storing on the server or locally, in addition to when to do so and why.  
Basically, your software produces data, and this data can be stored in a database on the server. In the  
case of our bookstore, we need to store books on the server and retrieve them from there.  
While developing with Blazor WebAssembly, your app needs to communicate with a Web API, which  
handles the communication with the data store \(such as a relational database, NoSQL database,  
key-value storage, etc.\). Developing an API that interacts with a database is out of this book’s scope,  
but in Chapter 8, Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly, you will learn how to consume  
an already built and published Web API to store and retrieve data about our BooksStore project.  
Another scenario to consider is the following\: if the admin is filling out a form to add a new book and  
then suddenly switches to another app or closes the browser after filling in that long form without  
saving it, does that mean they will have to fill it in again? Well, the typical answer is yes because  
closing the form without saving it means losing the data, and that’s fine for small and short forms,  
but if the user opens the form again and the data is still magically there waiting for the Save button  
to be clicked, how cool would that be?!  
That’s one reason for keeping the state of the data within the app. Another reason is to keep the  
components synchronized – for example, if the user adds an item to the shopping cart, the item page  
that contains the Add To Cart button has to update the Shopping Cart component and increase the  
number of items in the top bar icon instantly so that the state of the application is consistent.  
In Chapter 4, Navigation and Routing, we saw how we can use the URL and query parameters to store  
and send data between components; that’s also another technique to keep the state of the app, and we  
will look at it again in this chapter but from a data perspective.  
In the upcoming three sections, we will learn about and implement persisting the state of the app  
using three techniques\: browser storage, the in-memory approach, and the URL. Persisting the state in the browser’s local storage 155  
# Persisting the state in the browser’s local storage  
Most modern browsers have built-in mechanisms for storing data. This storage is local storage, which  
is used to store the data for the application across tabs. Even after closing the browser and opening it  
multiple times, the data stays there.  
Another option is session storage, which stores the data for a specific session in a single browser tab.  
If the user reloads the tab, the data persists, but each tab has its own data for the app and the data is  
not shared across tabs. Also, browsers have a built-in web API to store a significant number of objects  
in the JSON format, called IndexedDB. This is an additional option for local and session storage and  
a very good choice for storing records of data and querying them offline during the app’s lifetime.  
Now, let’s go over a practical example of storing the data in local storage.  
In the following practice, we are going to implement a great feature in our BooksStore app, which  
is saving the new book details that the admin is filling in on the BookForm page.  
To add a new book, we have developed a form that contains a set of properties, such as the title,  
description, number of pages, author, and price. Some are short fields and some are long, such as the  
description \(which could be a long paragraph\). What we will do is save what the user has filled in  
every 10 seconds, so if anything unexpected happens or the PC shuts down for some reason, the user  
will only lose up to 10 seconds’ worth of work.  
This information will be stored in the local storage of the browser. Blazor WebAssembly doesn’t have  
an out-of-the-box way to communicate with the local storage, so we will be using a famous third-party  
library called Blazored.LocalStorage to achieve this.  
In real-world modern applications, such a feature is a powerful part of an app, and it makes users feel  
safer while they are working, especially when the information is substantial, such as an application  
for university submissions, adding new products, writing blogs, and so on. So, always try to keep  
these kinds of features in mind early in the development process, as it makes your life and the user’s  
life much easier.  
Before we get started, there is a little improvement required to be able to implement the feature perfectly.  
In Chapter 6, Consuming JavaScript in Blazor, we developed the BlazorSimpleMde component,  
which we used as a text editor for the description field, and we implemented functionality to  
read its inner text.  
Before we proceed with the BookForm component, we will add a property called Content of the  
string type to the BlazorSimpleMde component. We will call the setMarkdownEditorValue  
JS function that we created to populate the content of the editor initially, as right now, the initial state  
of the editor is always empty and there is no way to initialize it with a value.  
We will do that so that if there is an unsubmitted form in the local storage of the browser, we can fetch  
the value and populate it in the SimpleMDE editor. 156  
Managing Application State  
Now, let’s see that in action\:  
1. Open the BlazorSimpleMde.razor component in the BooksStore.Blazor.  
Components project, and within the @code section, add a parameter named Content of  
the string type\:  
...  
\[Parameter\]  
public string? Content \{ get; set; \}  
...  
2. In the OnAfterRenderAsync method of the BlazorSimpleMde component, call the  
setMarkdownEditorValue JS function if the Content parameter is not null or empty;  
after the method modification, the code should look like this\:  
protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync\(bool  
firstRender\)  
\{  
if \(firstRender\)  
\{  
await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync\(  
"initializeMarkdownEditor"\);  
// Call the setMarkdownEditorValue and  
// pass the Content as a parameter to the  
// JS function  
try  
\{  
await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync\(  
"setMarkdownEditorValue", Content\);  
\}  
catch  
\{  
// In chapter 11, we will handle this  
// error  
// In real-world code avoid using  
// catch without any logging or  
// handling  
\}  
\}  
\}  
We wrapped the call with try/catch to avoid any errors that could arise from the SimpleMDE  
JS code. We will learn more about handling errors in Chapter 10, Handling Errors in Blazor  
WebAssembly. 3\. 4. 5. Persisting the state in the browser’s local storage 157  
Open the NuGet packages manager in the BooksStore project and install the Blazored.  
LocalStorage package, which is a well-known package for dealing with the local storage  
of the browser\:  
Figure 7.1 – The Blazored.LocalStorage NuGet package  
You can also install it using the following dotnet CLI command\:  
dotnet package install Blazored.LocalStorage  
After installing the package, we need to register the service in the dependency injection container  
by calling the AddBlazoredLocalStorage method. To achieve that, open the Program.  
cs file, reference the namespace of the package, and call the method\:  
...  
using Blazored.LocalStorage;  
...  
builder.Services.AddBlazoredLocalStorage\(\);  
...  
Now, we are ready to start using it in the BookForm component.  
Open the BookForm.razor component in the Pages folder, and at the top, add the  
reference to the Blazored.LocalStorage namespace, inject the ILocalStorage  
service, and implement the IDisposable interface \(to be used to dispose of some resources  
we will create later\)\:  
...  
@using Blazored.LocalStorage  
@inject ILocalStorageService LocalStorage  
@implements IDisposable 158  
Managing Application State  
6. In the @code section, write a method to store the current \_book object, but before we call  
the save method, we will fetch the Description value from the BlazorSimpleMde  
component, as the Description property in the \_book object is not filled automatically  
due to the JS intervention required\:  
...  
private async Task SaveFormStateAsync\(\)  
\{  
// Read the description from the SimpleMDE editor  
\_book.Description =  
await \_simpleMde.GetEditorValueAsync\(\);  
// SaveItemAsync takes a key which is the 'book'  
// and the value to store, it will be serialized  
// and stored as JSON object  
await LocalStorage.SetItemAsync\("book", \_book\);  
\}  
...  
7. Because the browser’s local storage is key-value-based, we need to pass two parameters \(the key  
and the value\) to store; in our case, the key is book and the value is the \_book object with all  
its properties, which will be stored as a JSON string in the local storage.  
The other side of the feature is checking whether there is a saved Book object in the local storage,  
so fetch the saved Book object and populate the \_book object with the stored value, and then  
explicitly set the content of the BlazorSimpleMDE component of the description field\:  
...  
private async Task CheckSavedStateAsync\(\)  
\{  
// ContainsKeyAsync method check Whether there is a  
// stored key in the browser's local storage  
if \(await LocalStorage.ContainKeyAsync\("book"\)\)  
\{  
\_book = await LocalStorage.GetItemAsync\<  
SubmitBook\>\("book"\);  
\}  
...  
8. The last method to deal with local storage is RemoveItemAsync, and we will use this to  
remove a saved book object after submitting the form, as that means this saved data is no  
longer needed.  
So, wrap the call in a method called ClearSavedStateAsync as follows\:  
...  
private async Task ClearSavedStateAsync\(\)  
\{ Persisting the state in the browser’s local storage 159  
await LocalStorage.RemoveItemAsync\("book"\);  
\}  
...  
9. It’s time to build the timer, which will trigger the SaveFormStateAsync method we  
created in step 6, so we need to create an object of the Timer type called \_timer. Then,  
within a method called SetupTimer, we will initialize it, set its interval to 10 seconds, use its  
Elapsed event to trigger the SaveFormStateAsync method, and finally, call its Start  
method so it starts ticking\:  
...  
private System.Timers.Timer \_timer = new\(\);  
private void SetupTimer\(\)  
\{  
var second = 1000;  
\_timer.Interval = 10 \* second;  
\_timer.Elapsed += async \(sender, e\) =\>  
\{  
await SaveFormStateAsync\(\);  
\};  
\_timer.Start\(\);  
\}  
...  
10. To avoid any memory leaks and stay efficient, we need to dispose of the \_timer object we  
created, and we will implement that in the Dispose method available in the IDisposable  
interface as shown here\:  
...  
public void Dispose\(\)  
\{  
\_timer.Stop\(\);  
\_timer.Dispose\(\);  
\}  
...  
Now, we have all methods and logic ready enough to finalize the feature.  
1. We need to override the OnInitializedAsync method so that we can call the SetupTimer  
and CheckSavedStateAsync methods. As a result, whenever the user redirects to the  
BookForm page, the timer starts ticking to save the state every 10 seconds and also checks  
whether there is saved data in the local storage to fetch and populate it\:  
...  
protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{ 160  
Managing Application State  
SetupTimer\(\);  
await CheckSavedStateAsync\(\);  
\}  
...  
2. Finally, when the user submits the form successfully, we need to clear any stored data by calling  
ClearSavedStateAsync at the end of the HandleBookFormSubmission method  
we created in Chapter 5, Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation\:  
private async void HandleBookFormSubmission\(\)  
\{  
...  
await ClearSavedStateAsync\(\);  
\}  
Everything is in good shape right now to be tested and to make sure this functionality is working as  
expected, so run the application, navigate to /book/form, then start populating the fields in the  
form, such as the Title and Description fields.  
After 10 seconds or more, refresh the page, or close the browser and open it again.  
You can have a look at the data within the local storage by opening the developer tools of the browser,  
navigating to the Application section, then expanding Local Storage, and clicking on the URL of  
your app.  
On the right side, you should see the book key with its value, which represents a \_book object in  
JSON format, as shown here\:  
Figure 7.2 – The book object stored in the local storage Persisting the state in the memory 161  
Note  
There is another library for interacting with the session storage of the browser, which is Blazored.  
SessionStorage. You can learn more about it via the following link\: https\://github.  
com/Blazored/SessionStorage. Also, an open source package is available for Blazor  
WebAssembly to store and retrieve data from a browser’s IndexedDB. You can find the steps  
on how to get started with it here\: https\://github.com/nwestfall/BlazorDB.  
Now we have learned how to store the app state in the storage of the browser, let’s find out how we  
can persist the state of the app using an in-memory solution.  
# Persisting the state in the memory  
Using in-memory objects and instances is another option for keeping the state of the app synchronized  
across the components and instances.  
We can achieve this by creating a class that has the property to be stored, a delegate so that the consumer  
components can subscribe to it to execute some logic when its value changes, and an update method,  
which sets the value of the property and triggers the delegate.  
After creating the class, we register an instance of it in the dependency injection container as a singleton,  
which will be a single instance created when the app is loaded in the browser, and the same instance  
is used when any component or service injects the object.  
One component can call the Update method and pass the value, and other components can be listeners  
for the change by subscribing to the delegate and executing some logic in reaction to the value change.  
Let’s take a scenario of an app that has certain dashboards, where each dashboard visualizes data for  
a period that the user can define – for example, the last 24 hours, the last week, and the last month.  
The app has a period picker on its navbar at the top of the page, and whenever the user changes the period,  
all the dashboard pages must react to this event and keep that state across the application’s lifetime.  
The following diagram shows how this example works\:  
Figure 7.3 – Flow of in-memory state management 162  
Managing Application State  
Now, let’s practically demonstrate how we can achieve what we have explained. To keep things simple,  
we will use the Counter page. We will store the current counter in an in-memory object, and its value  
will be reflected beside the title of the page in the navbar.  
When the app runs, an instance of the state object will be created, and the current counter will be  
initialized to 0. We will inject this object into the Counter page, and in the Navbar component, the  
Counter page will update the current counter value, while the Navbar component will listen to that  
change and update the UI accordingly. Follow these steps\:  
1\. 2. Let’s start creating the state container object by creating a new class in the BooksStore  
project and calling it AppStateContainer.cs.  
The object will hold the CurrentCounter property of the int type, a delegate of the  
Action\<int\> type called OnCounterChanged, and listener components, and can subscribe  
to this delegate so that whenever it gets triggered, they can receive the new value, and finally,  
the UpdateCounter method, which updates the CurrentCounter property and triggers  
the OnCounterChanged delegate\:  
public class AppStateContainer  
\{  
public int CurrentCounter \{ get; set; \}  
public Action\<int\>? OnCounterChanged \{ get; set; \}  
public void UpdateCounter\(int newCounter\)  
\{  
CurrentCounter = newCounter;  
OnCounterChanged?.Invoke\(newCounter\);  
\}  
\}  
3\. Register this object in the dependency injection container by opening the Program.cs file  
and registering AppStateContainer using the AddSingleton method, which means  
registering a single instance of the object that lives throughout the app’s lifetime\:  
...  
// The class instance will be injected in every  
// component or service that injects the  
// AppStateContainer  
builder.Services.AddSingleton\<AppStateContainer\>\(\);  
await builder.Build\(\).RunAsync\(\);  
The AppStateContainer object is ready to be used by the Counter page and the Navbar  
component. We will start with the Counter page first. 4\. 5. 6. Persisting the state in the memory 163  
In Counter.razor, in the Pages folder, inject AppStateContainer at the top of the  
page, and set its layout to UserLayout so that it uses the public layout, not the default one,  
which is supposed to be for an admin user\:  
@page "/counter"  
@inject AppStateContainer AppStateContainer  
@layout UserLayout  
...  
We need to bring back the Increment Count button that we removed in Chapter 4, Navigation  
and Routing, so when we click it, the IncrementCount method is executed\:  
@\* Add the Increment Count button\*@  
\<button class="btn btn-primary" @  
onclick="IncrementCount"\>Increment Count\</button\>  
@code \{  
...  
In the IncrementCount method, after the line that increases the currentCount variable  
by one, we will call the UpdateCounter method in AppStateCounter, so the full method  
will look like this\:  
private void IncrementCount\(\)  
\{  
currentCount++;  
AppStateContainer.UpdateCounter\(currentCount\);  
\}  
After running the app and navigating to /counter, the page should look like this\:  
Figure 7.4 – Updated Counter page 164  
Managing Application State  
7. The other side of the process is the Navbar.razor component in the Shared folder. We  
need to append the current counter value to the Counter link in the menu so that the Counter  
page link will be Counter \(Current\_Counter\_Value\).  
Let’s inject the AppStateContainer object, and implement the IDisposable interface\:  
@inject AppStateContainer AppStateContainer  
@implements IDisposable  
...  
8. In the @code section, create a variable of the int type called currentCount, and a method  
called OnCounterChange, which takes a parameter of the int type.  
The method will set the value of the local variable to the passed value of the parameter and call  
the StateHasChanged method. As this OnCounterChanged method will be triggered  
from the AppStateContainer object outside the Navbar component, Blazor doesn’t  
update the UI accordingly because of the render tree tracking \(we will talk more about this in  
sw, RenderTree in Blazor\)\:  
...  
private int currentCount = 0;  
private void OnCounterChanged\(int newCounter\)  
\{  
currentCount = newCounter;  
StateHasChanged\(\);  
\}  
...  
9\. Override the OnInitialized method and, within it, add the following logic\:  
protected override void OnInitialized\(\)  
\{  
// Set the initial value of the currentState  
// variable to the value from the  
// AppStateContainer  
currentCount =  
AppStateContainer.CurrentCounter;  
// Subscribe to the OnCounterChanged delegate  
// and assign the OnCounterChanged method to  
// it  
AppStateContainer.OnCounterChanged += OnCounterChanged;  
\} Persisting the state in the memory 165  
10. Unsubscribe from the OnCounterChanged delegate in the Dispose method to avoid  
keeping the subscriptions in the memory, as keeping them will prevent the Garbage Collector  
from collecting the whole component, and that could lead to memory leak issues\:  
public void Dispose\(\)  
\{  
AppStateContainer.OnCounterChanged -=  
OnCounterChanged;  
\}  
11. Finally, in the markup part of the file, update the content of the NavLink component for the  
Counter page to add the currentCount value to it\:  
...  
\<NavLink class="nav-link" href="/Counter"\>Counter  
@\(currentCount\)\</NavLink\>  
...  
Here we go! Now, we can run the app! The first thing you will notice is the Counter \(0\) tab in the navbar\:  
Figure 7.5 – Updated Counter page link  
Navigate to the Counter page, and click Increment Count multiple times. The first thing to notice is  
that the Counter link in the navbar is updated with the latest current counter value.  
The second thing is that whenever you navigate in the app, the current counter value will persist, and  
the latest value will stay beside the Counter link, as follows\: 166  
Managing Application State  
Figure 7.6 – Current counter state persists using in-memory object  
After implementing this demonstration successfully, you should be able to use this solution in your  
projects to solve many cases, such as updating a shopping cart and keeping it stored, or even receiving  
and showing notifications while persisting the whole app state based on the notification count, read  
status, and so much more.  
In this section, we have seen how we can use a local in-memory object to keep the state of the  
components consistent. In the next section, we will learn how to use the URL and query parameters  
as another technique to persist the state.  
# Persisting the state using the URL  
The URL is used mainly for navigation between the app pages, but we have already seen in Chapter 4,  
Navigation and Routing, how we can send data in the URL to other components and pages.  
The same techniques we used, such as the routing parameters or query parameters to transfer data,  
are also used to keep the flow and the state of the app.  
A common example that you may face in every app you build is having a page where there is a list of  
data to show, just like the Index page of our BooksStore app, which renders a list of books.  
The list can be long, so pagination is the solution; each page shows a chunk of the books, and the user  
can navigate between the pages.  
For a good user experience and to make the app easier to use, you need to keep the state of the current  
page that the user is navigating. When the user refreshes the page, shares the link, or opens it in another  
tab or browser, the same chunk of data will be listed, and the state of the page will persist if the page  
number in the URL is passed as a query parameter. Persisting the state using the URL 167  
This technique is used widely, and you can notice it in almost every app you open. Storing the data  
in a URL is a common approach and it’s good to plan your components and pages for this scenario  
from the early stages.  
In the next exercise, we will implement adding a page number query parameter to the Index page  
and see how we can save that state using the URL\:  
1. Open the Index.razor file within the Pages/UserPages folder, and in the @code  
section, add a parameter of the int type called PageNumber\:  
...  
\[Parameter\]  
\[SupplyParameterFromQuery\(Name="pageNumber"\)\]  
public int PageNumber \{ get; set; \};  
...  
2. Override the OnParametersSet method, and add a check for PageNumber; if it equals  
or is less than 0, set its value to 1\:  
...  
protected override void OnParametersSet\(\)  
\{  
if \(PageNumber \<= 0\)  
PageNumber = 1;  
\}  
...  
3. Such a step is important to keep your app consistent and efficient and avoid any scenarios that  
could lead to unlikely behavior in the logic.  
To keep things simple, we will print the number of the page in the browser’s tab title, using the  
\<PageTitle\> component at the top\:  
...  
\<PageTitle\>Index | Page @PageNumber\</PageTitle\>  
...  
4. Add a method called GoToPage, which takes the number of the page; the method will navigate  
to the same URL but append the value of the query parameter as shown\:  
...  
private void GoToPage\(int pageNumber\)  
\{  
PageNumber = pageNumber;  
Navigation.NavigateTo\(  
\$"/?pageNumber=\{pageNumber\}"\);  
// TODO\: Logic to fetch the books by the new page  
// number 168  
Managing Application State  
\}  
...  
5. The local navigation to the same page won’t achieve anything other than adding the value to  
the URL; if the user shares the link or refreshes it, the page number will be persisted.  
For testing purposes, we will add three little buttons to navigate between the three pages below  
the DataListView component, as shown\:  
...  
\<div class="mt-2"\>  
\<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="\(\) =\>  
GoToPage\(1\)"\>1\</button\>  
\<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="\(\) =\>  
GoToPage\(2\)"\>2\</button\>  
\<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="\(\) =\>  
GoToPage\(3\)"\>3\</button\>  
\</div\>  
...  
Done! Run the app, and you should notice that the title of the tab in the browser has the page number  
there, in addition to three buttons. If you click on them, the page number will be added or updated  
in the URL, as shown here\:  
Figure 7.7 – Page number stored in the URL Summary 169  
In a real-world scenario, more details are needed, such as disabling the button of the current page, in  
addition to some design aspects to give the ultimate experience for your users.  
The examples are not limited to paging. When you use any web app, notice the URL and how much  
data is stored there, and you can learn how to use the URL and query parameters more efficiently.  
While building your own apps, try to think about state management features from the infrastructure  
level, as these make the app more useable and smoother to use, even though state management doesn’t  
have any UI effects. If the Pages button only changes the page number internally in the component  
every time the page gets refreshed, the user has to navigate to the target page again, in addition to  
losing the possibility of sharing a link that points directly to the chunk of data needed.  
Note  
Modern software operates as smoothly as possible and serves the user in the easiest way possible;  
state management relates directly to that aspect, so take care of it very well!  
Last but not least, if you are already a frontend developer with any JS frameworks such as React, you  
have already heard about Redux. Basically, Redux is a JS library that centralizes the process of state  
management in a single place, and it’s very common in the JS world. Luckily! The great community of  
Blazor developers has got you covered; Blazor.Fluxor is a Redux-like alternative for Blazor. You can  
learn more about Fluxor and how to get started with it at the following link\: https\://github.  
com/mrpmorris/Fluxor.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we learned how we can keep the user experience as consistent as possible, as well as  
keeping it safe by persisting the state of the app.  
We started by defining what state management is and then we discovered the possible ways to persist  
the flow of what the user was doing, from browser storage to an in-memory approach, and finally,  
using the URL.  
Alongside the explanation, we explored three practical examples that added powerful features to our  
app, from storing the data the user is filling in to keep it safe for any surprise event to using the URL  
to store the current page number that the user has navigated to.  
After going through this chapter, you should be able to do the following\:  
•

# Consuming Web APIs from  
# Blazor WebAssembly  
It’s time to feed our application and the page we have built with a real data source, let the app  
communicate with an online service to list the books available, and create the functionality for an  
admin to add new ones.  
We will start this chapter by explaining why you need to communicate with an API from your Blazor  
app, in addition to understanding the built-in .NET class HttpClient, as well as other extensions that  
will be used to implement the communication with the API.  
Next, we will practice sending GET and POST requests to our API. We will also explore some more  
advanced techniques to manage and manipulate HttpClient instances. We will use IHttpClientFactory  
and delegating handlers to apply global logic to HTTP requests and responses. By the end of the  
chapter, we will have learned how to encapsulate the API calls and take them out of the components  
to keep them clean and testable.  
This chapter will enable you to consume APIs, either APIs you have built or third-party APIs, and  
teach you to implement API calls in a clear, efficient, and readable way. The following topics will be  
covered in this chapter\:

# Technical requirements  
The Blazor WebAssembly code used throughout this chapter is available in this book’s GitHub repository\:  
https\://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Blazor-WebAssembly/  
tree/main/Chapter\_08/Chapter\_Content  
Within this chapter, there will be a separate API project that you can clone from the GitHub repository too\:  
https\://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Blazor-WebAssembly/  
tree/main/Chapter\_08/API  
The API project is required to test the calls, so after cloning the API solution, you can run the project  
just like running Blazor WebAssembly using either of these two options\:  
•  
Open the terminal in the API project folder and run these commands\:  
dotnet build  
dotnet run  
•  
Alternatively, run the project using the Start button in Visual Studio.  
If the project runs successfully, navigate in the browser to https\://localhost\:7188 and you  
should see the Swagger \(API documentation\) page.  
Figure 8.1 – BooksStore API documentation page Understanding web API clients 173  
Note  
Because this book focuses only on the client side, there will be no explanation of how the API  
project works internally, and all the code will focus on consuming the API instead.  
# Understanding web API clients  
Before we start consuming the BooksStore API, let’s talk a bit about web APIs. Basically, an API  
is a kind of interface for a set of functions, and this interface is accessible by code.  
Let’s take smartphone notifications as an example. If you are developing an app for a smartphone,  
be it iOS or Android, the operating system provides you with an API to deal with its notification  
functionality for things such as showing a new notification or defining what should happen when  
you click on a notification.  
A web API is also an application programming interface, as the name suggests, but it’s accessible over  
the web via HTTP. It’s a kind of web application that exposes certain functionalities and is hosted on a  
server somewhere in the world. Your application can consume the functions that the web API exposes  
by sending HTTP requests, and it will send you the status of the data received in an HTTP response.  
Web APIs are a crucial part of modern software development and are almost ubiquitous. When you  
open your smartphone to check the weather, the app is a client that renders weather data coming  
from a specific web API. Likewise, when you navigate the news in your browser and see many articles  
from different sources in one place, that’s all facilitated by the web APIs of the different news agencies.  
No matter the framework you are working on for a client application, whether Blazor or any JavaScript  
framework, and whether it’s a Windows, Android, or iOS client, the API is accessible via HTTP, so  
you don’t need to be concerned with the language used to build that API or what kind of server it is  
hosted on.  
When do you need a web API?  
Well, in most cases, you need a backend for your application, no matter what the app does. The web  
API wraps all the logic of the system – the business logic, communication with the database, and user  
management, among other stuff.  
In rare cases, you can have an app that runs on the client machine in the browser or a native app that  
doesn’t require an API \(for example, a Markdown editor or a drawing app\), but even in these scenarios,  
a web API may still be needed to manage users or store their files in the cloud.  
That leads to another question – do you always need to have your own API? The answer is not always.  
There are some scenarios in which you may develop a frontend for a third-party API – for example,  
building a contacts app. In that case, you can rely on the Microsoft API \(Microsoft Graph\) to store or  
retrieve user contacts. The user can log in with a Microsoft account and get access to their contacts. 174  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
However, for our bookstore project, we need a web API that wraps all the logic of storing and retrieving  
books, in addition to managing users and user orders. So, as a Blazor WebAssembly app developer,  
should you be responsible for developing the API? That actually depends on whether you are a solo  
developer or an employee in an organization. If you are a solo developer, you will build your own app,  
as you’re basically a full stack developer, so you will also need to build that API yourself. If you are  
working in an organization, there may be separate frontend and backend teams for a project. Thus,  
you may only need to work on the Blazor app.  
In any of the aforementioned scenarios, while you are developing a Blazor WebAssembly app, you  
will consume a web API, whether it’s a third-party web API, an API you developed, or one developed  
by your colleagues.  
Throughout this chapter, you will learn how to understand and read an existing API, use utilities such  
as Postman to test it, and then leverage the HttpClient class in .NET to send requests to the web  
API you are working with.  
Understanding and reading a web API  
As a frontend developer, you need to be able to understand the API you are dealing with by identifying  
requests and their schemes, the parameters they accept, the payload you need to send, and the response  
that the web API returns for each request.  
Each web API exposes a set of methods known as endpoints, which you call by sending an HTTP  
request that points to that endpoint alongside the required request metadata and body if needed. After  
you send the request and the web API processes it successfully, it will send you an HTTP response  
that also contains a status code describing the status of your request, along with an optional body if  
the endpoint you called returns any data.  
Now, the question that arises is, how would you know all those details about the web API, especially  
if you did not develop it?  
Every modern web API has documentation that lists the available requests with all their accepted  
parameters and the data it receives in the body if there is any, in addition to the response and the  
scheme of the data it contains.  
For the BooksStore API, when you run the project and navigate to https\://localhost\:7188,  
you will be automatically redirected to /swagger/index.html, as follows\: Understanding web API clients 175  
Figure 8.2 – BooksStore API Swagger documentation  
The UI shown in the preceding figure is the Swagger page. This page is auto-generated by the Swagger  
framework. It reads the structure of an ASP.NET Core API and generates documentation for it. The  
Swagger page also allows you to test API calls directly from the page.  
Most third-party web APIs, such as Microsoft Graph, have their own documentation online. You  
can find the full documentation for Microsoft Graph at the following link\: https\://learn.  
microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api. You can search online for the documentation  
of your targeted API and use it to kickstart your exploration and testing journey. 176  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
The BooksStore API exposes multiple endpoints, two for authentication \(login and register\)  
and five book actions \(get all, get by ID, create, update, and delete\). As you can see in the Swagger  
documentation, the requests are identified with the words POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. Those are  
the method types of HTTP requests. The method is used to clarify the purpose of the request. The  
following table shows the most commonly used methods, alongside their usages\:  
Method Description \(Purpose\) Specification  
POST Create a new resource The request has a body that you can send the  
data into  
GET Retrieve a specific resource The GET request doesn’t have a body to send data  
into; the data or parameters must be passed in  
the URL  
PUT Update or replace \(replacing  
the full object\)  
The request has a body that you can send the  
data into  
PATCH Update or modify \(update one  
property or more\)  
The request has a body  
DELETE Delete a resource The request doesn’t have a body and the targeted  
resource should be passed in the URL as a parameter,  
such as the ID of the resource  
Table 8.1 – Most commonly used HTTP methods  
Referring back to Figure 8.2, the /Books GET request is expanded, and, as you can see in the  
figure, the Swagger page shows you the possible responses – for example, the status code 200, which  
represents a successful request. It will retrieve a JSON file containing an array of books. The Swagger  
documentation also lists the objects and their schemes used in the endpoints at the bottom of the  
page. From those schemes, you can build your classes, as we will do in the next section.  
Testing a web API with Postman  
Before you start to write code to consume a web API, it’s good practice to test the APIs with a specialized  
tool. Despite the fact that Swagger provides a mechanism to test the API directly from the page itself,  
we will use a tool called Postman. You can find and download it from the following link\: https\://  
www.postman.com/. Because not all APIs use Swagger, learning how to test them using Postman  
gives you more flexibility, especially when working with third-party web APIs.  
Postman is a common and easy-to-use app that you can utilize to simulate API calls. Postman is a  
huge app and has a variety of features, but we will focus on sending requests and reading the response  
only, as that is what’s needed for testing the endpoint. We will start by writing the code to send the  
simulated requests from our app. Understanding web API clients 177  
You may ask why we need to use a tool such as Postman if we can already write the code directly. Well,  
the thing is that by using Postman, you can test the calls quickly without effort and identify exactly  
what URL to use, what parameters to pass, what objects to send in the body, and, finally, understand  
the response, and then start your coding around that.  
Because our API is written in ASP.NET Core, it comes with a weather forecast endpoint by default,  
which is what we will test in this section\:  
1. Run the API and navigate to the Swagger page. You will see a /WeatherForecast GET request.  
Figure 8.3 – /WeatherForecast GET request in documentation 178  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
2\. After you have created an account \(if you don’t have one already\), open Postman and click on  
the New button in the top left\:  
Figure 8.4 – Postman New request button  
3\. 4. Choose HTTP Request from the dialog that appears.  
In the new request tab, make sure to insert the base URL of the API, followed by the route of  
the endpoint, which is /weatherforecast. Then, choose GET from the dropdown on the  
left-hand side of the URL bar, as shown here\:  
Figure 8.5 – New request in Postman  
5. Click the Send button and Postman will send the request to the web API. You should see a  
response saying that the content has been received along with the status code in the bottom  
section of Postman’s UI\: Calling a web API from Blazor WebAssembly 179  
Figure 8.6 – /WeatherForecast endpoint successful response  
Congrats! This output means you have set up the API project and Postman successfully, understood  
the meaning behind what we will be doing further on in this chapter, and made sure that everything  
works fine. Let’s get started writing some code to achieve the same thing in our Blazor app.  
# Calling a web API from Blazor WebAssembly  
Making calls to the web API from the Blazor app involves the same steps as doing so from Postman.  
We start by defining the endpoint to call, prepare the data to send with the request if needed, submit  
the request, and, finally, receive and process the response.  
.NET has a built-in class called HttpClient, which is a rich class that provides all the functionality  
and configuration needed to send any type of request \(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, and more\)  
to a given web API. 180  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
Understanding FetchData component logic  
All Blazor WebAssembly projects have a default page called FetchData in the Pages folder. The  
logic of this page is to make a GET request to download the content of a JSON file that lives in the  
wwwroot folder, and that content also represents weather forecast data. So, let’s analyze the code of  
the FetchData component so that we understand it better\:  
@page "/fetchdata"  
@inject HttpClient Http  
...  
@foreach \(var forecast in forecasts\)  
\{  
\<tr\>  
\<td\>  
@forecast.Date.ToShortDateString\(\)  
\</td\>  
\<td\>@forecast.TemperatureC\</td\>  
\<td\>@forecast.TemperatureF\</td\>  
\<td\>@forecast.Summary\</td\>  
\</tr\>  
\}  
...  
@code \{  
private WeatherForecast\[\]? forecasts;  
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
forecasts = await  
Http.GetFromJsonAsync\<WeatherForecast\[\]\>\("sample-  
data/weather.json"\);  
\}  
public class WeatherForecast  
\{  
public DateTime Date \{ get; set; \}  
public int TemperatureC \{ get; set; \}  
public string? Summary \{ get; set; \}  
public int TemperatureF =\>  
32 + \(int\)\(TemperatureC / 0.5556\);  
\}  
\} Calling a web API from Blazor WebAssembly 181  
In the previous code snippet, we notice the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
In the second line in the snippet, there is an instance of the HttpClient type called Http  
injected into the component.  
In the @code section, there is a class called WeatherForecast, and the properties inside  
represent the data in the weather forecast JSON object, which we will see in step 5.  
There is a declaration for a WeatherForecast array called forecasts.  
The most important part for us is the line inside OnInitializedAsync, which is basically  
the GET call to download the content of the file. The code provided uses the injected Http object  
and the GetFromJsonAsync method; this is an extension method for the HttpClient  
class, and it sends a GET request to a specific URL \(sample-data/weather.json in this  
example\), reads the JSON content that comes with the response, and deserializes it to a defined  
type – in this case, it’s deserialized to an array of WeatherForecast. Finally, it assigns that  
value to the forecasts variable.  
We will talk more about the origin of the base URL for the request after this section.  
The request refers to a JSON file in the sample-data folder called weather.json. We  
can find the folder and the file in the wwwroot folder of the project, and if we open it, we will  
see the following JSON\:  
\[  
\{  
"date"\: "2018-05-06",  
"temperatureC"\: 1,  
"summary"\: "Freezing"  
\},  
...  
\]  
JSON represents an array of an object that contains three properties – date, temperatureC,  
and summary. The WeatherForecast class has been defined based on these properties.  
•  
Finally, in the markup section, there is an if statement to check whether the forecasts  
array is null, and if not, it creates an HTML table, iterates over each item in the forecasts  
array, and renders a row for it in that table.  
The preceding is an explanation of the default code that uses HttpClient to get content from  
a server. Before we write our first call to fetch the books from the BooksStore API, instead of  
getting them from an in-memory list, let’s see where that HttpClient instance comes from and  
how it’s configured. 182  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
Configuring HttpClient in Blazor WebAssembly  
Because the FetchData component injected an instance of HttpClient, the object is already  
registered in the dependency injection container. By default, Blazor did that for us. Let’s open the  
Program.cs file, and we will find the following line\:  
...  
builder.Services.AddScoped\(sp =\> new HttpClient \{ BaseAddress = new  
Uri\(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress\) \}\);  
...  
This registers a new object of the HttpClient type configured with a base address via the  
BaseAddress property. This property sets the base URL of every call you send. Because, by default,  
it is set to the root URL of the application, the GetFromJsonAsync method in the FetchData  
component directly points to /sample-data/weather.json without the need to set the full  
URL of the app.  
The BooksStore API has a different URL. During development, it will be https\://  
localhost\:7188, and when we publish it, it will be something else, so we need to modify the  
BaseAddress property in the current HttpClient registration.  
So, let’s get that done first\:  
1\. Open the wwwroot folder and the appsettings.Development.json file we created  
in Chapter 1, Understanding the Anatomy of a Blazor WebAssembly Project, in which we talked  
about environments. We added a property called ApiUrl, so let’s modify its value to the URL  
of the web API so that the JSON file will look like this\:  
\{  
"ApiUrl"\: "https\://localhost\:7188"  
\}  
2. Setting the URL here instead of hardcoding it into Program.cs will make it easier to develop,  
and when we push to production, we can set the production URL of the API in appsettings.  
json, which will be used by the app when it’s in the production environment. So, there’s  
no need to change the URL in Program.cs during development and then change it later  
before publishing.  
Turning back to Program.cs, change the value of the BaseAddress property to make it  
refer to the ApiUrl value from the configuration, as shown here\:  
...  
builder.Services.AddScoped\(sp =\> new HttpClient \{ BaseAddress =  
new Uri\(builder.Configuration\["ApiUrl"\]\) \}\);  
... Calling a web API from Blazor WebAssembly 183  
3. Now, we are ready to start using this HttpClient instance to send API requests to our  
BooksStore API. However, by changing the base URL, the current FetchData component  
will stop working because its GET request refers to the JSON file in the base URL of the Blazor  
WebAssembly project. We need to fix this.  
In the FetchData.razor component in the Pages folder, we can either point to the /  
WeatherForecast GET endpoint that the API offers, or we will need to set the full URL  
of the application in GetFromJsonAsync so that it overrides the URL of the API we set in  
Program.cs. The first solution is better, as it keeps the API source of our project unified, so  
let’s update that line as follows\:  
...  
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
forecasts = await  
Http.GetFromJsonAsync\<WeatherForecast\[\]\>\(  
"/WeatherForecast"\);  
\}  
...  
That will fetch the same data from the /WeatherForecast endpoint we tested in the  
previous section with Postman.  
To make sure everything is fine, let’s run the project and navigate to /FetchData and make sure the  
web API is running too. You should be able to see the table of the weather data populated normally,  
but this time, the data will come from the web API, not the JSON file in the wwwroot folder.  
Figure 8.7 – Updated FetchData page to get the weather data from the API 184  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
# Sending a GET request  
Let’s learn more about calling web APIs and improve our project even further. When you run the  
project, it redirects you by default to the index page, where a list of books will be shown on the UI.  
The books are fetched from a local in-memory collection inside the LocalBooksService.cs  
class within the Services folder. We need to replace that fixed data list with a web API call that  
retrieves the books from the API. Unlike the GET request we saw in the FetchData component,  
this one will be written step by step, and we will have better control over the response\:  
1\. As we learned earlier, before we write the code, we need to understand the targeted endpoint.  
Navigate to the web API Swagger page and expand the /Books GET request to see what it  
returns in both success and failure cases.  
2\. You can open Postman and send a GET request to https\://localhost\:7188/books  
to see the response it retrieves.  
Figure 8.8 – GET /Books request responses in web API 3\. 4. Sending a GET request 185  
The documentation says that the endpoint either returns the status code 200, which indicates  
success, or 400, which indicates failure. In a successful case, the content of the response will  
be an array of books, and, in the case of failure, it will return an object that contains a message  
property of the string type and an array of strings called errors. We deserialize these two objects  
based on the desired status into corresponding C\# classes.  
Earlier, we created a Book class and the coverImageUrl property coming from the  
API that we need to add to the model. You also need to make sure that the JSON properties  
coming from the API are mapped correctly to the C\# object you have. So, we will use the  
\[JsonPropertyName\(\)\] attribute for each C\# property in the Book class. In the current  
case, the names of the JSON properties are the same for our Book class, but that won’t always  
be the case, so it’s a good practice to map them explicitly, as shown here\:  
public class Book  
\{  
\[JsonPropertyName\("title"\)\]  
public string? Title \{ get; set; \}  
\[JsonPropertyName\("authorName"\)\]  
public string? AuthorName \{ get; set; \}  
\[JsonPropertyName\("publishingDate"\)\]  
public DateTime PublishingDate \{ get; set; \}  
\[JsonPropertyName\("price"\)\]  
public decimal Price \{ get; set; \}  
\[JsonPropertyName\("description"\)\]  
public string? Description \{ get; set; \}  
\[JsonPropertyName\("coverImageUrl"\)\]  
public string? CoverImageUrl \{ get; set; \}  
\[JsonPropertyName\("id"\)\]  
public string? Id \{ get; set; \}  
\[JsonPropertyName\("pagesCount"\)\]  
public int PagesCount \{ get; set; \}  
\}  
Create a C\# class that corresponds to the failure object based on the documentation in the  
Models folder and call it ApiErrorResponse\:  
public class ApiErrorResponse  
\{  
\[JsonPropertyName\("message"\)\]  
public string? Message \{ get; set; \}  
\[JsonPropertyName\("errors"\)\]  
public string\[\]? Errors \{ get; set; \}  
\} 186  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
5. Open the Index.razor page in the Pages/UserPages folder, and let’s inject an instance  
of the HttpClient class and call it Http\:  
...  
@inject HttpClient Http  
...  
6. In the @code section, create a method called GetBooksAsync that has the following code\:  
...  
private async Task\<List\<Book\>?\> GetBooksAsync\(\)  
\{  
var response = await Http.GetAsync\("/books"\);  
if \(response.IsSuccessStatusCode\)  
// if response status code is 2XX  
\{  
return await response.Content  
.ReadFromJsonAsync\<List\<Book\>\>\(\);  
\}  
else  
\{  
var errorResponse = await response.Content  
.ReadFromJsonAsync\<ApiErrorResponse\>\(\);  
// Throw an exception with the error  
// message for now  
throw new Exception\(errorResponse?.Message\);  
// TODO\: Handle the error in Chapter 11  
\}  
\}  
...  
Let’s explain what this method does step by step. First, it uses the Http.GetAsync method  
to send a GET request to the /books endpoint in the web API. We refrained from using the  
GetFromJsonAsync extension method in this scenario because it does not handle unsuccessful  
responses effectively. If the response does not indicate success, GetFromJsonAsync throws  
an exception, making it difficult to control the error-handling process. GetAsync will retrieve  
an object of the HttpResponseMessage type, and we can handle successful and failed  
cases manually.  
After that, we check whether IsSuccessStatusCode is set to true in the response object.  
This property is set to true if the response status code is 2XX. If the request succeeds, the  
endpoint documentation tells us that it returns a collection of Book objects, so we need to  
read the JSON content of the response and deserialize it into a list of books. The Content  
property within the response object has a set of methods that allow us to read the content in  
different ways, and there is an extension method called ReadFromJsonAsync that reads Implementing a POST web API call in Blazor WebAssembly 187  
7\. the content of the response and deserializes it into a specific type. So, we read and deserialize  
the content to List\<Book\> and return it.  
If the request failed, we know that the API will return an ApiErrorResponse object, so we  
deserialize the content to that type and, for the time being, we will throw an exception, but we  
will look at error handling in more depth in Chapter 10, Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly.  
Call the GetBooksAsync method within OnInitializedAsync and assign the returning  
value to the existing \_books variable that’s being rendered in the UI. We can achieve that by  
commenting out the current code that fetches from BooksService and adding the call we  
just created, as follows\:  
protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
...  
//\_books = await BooksService.GetAllBooksAsync\(\);  
\_books = await GetBooksAsync\(\);  
\}  
That’s how you can make a GET request in detail, from understanding the request and the response it  
returns to creating the model, sending the request, and finally running the app alongside the API and  
navigating to the Index page. The app should list all the books retrieved from the web API.  
Note  
Sometimes, you may not be interested in all the properties returned by the API, so you can add  
only what you need to the corresponding C\# models you are creating.  
Now that we have learned how to fetch data from the API, it’s time to learn how to send data to it  
by implementing a POST request in the BookForm component. The request should hold book  
information for the API so that the API can save the book in the API data store.  
# Implementing a POST web API call in Blazor WebAssembly  
We have developed the BookForm page, which has a form for entering the book details and a submit  
button that currently does nothing other than write some logs to the console window.  
The BookForm page is for the store admin, who can insert new books. For now, we don’t have  
authentication either on the server side in the web API or on the client side; that’s the target of  
Chapter 9. But we need to complete the logic of this page so that when the admin clicks the Submit  
button, the book gets posted to the API, which stores it in its data source. When the app goes online  
in production and an admin adds a new book, all those users who navigate to the app will see the new  
book on the Index page because that web API is the main source of data for our project. 188  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
The BooksStore API exposes a POST endpoint, and according to the Swagger documentation,  
accepts a JSON object in the body of the POST request, as shown here\:  
\{  
"title"\: "string",  
"description"\: "string",  
"author"\: "string",  
"price"\: 0,  
"pagesCount"\: 0,  
"publishingDate"\: "2023-02-14T02\:11\:26.158Z"  
\}  
In the Models folder, we have a model called SubmitBook that’s used by the BookForm page.  
We need to match the properties in the JSON of the POST request to the properties’ names in the  
SubmitBook.cs file. We will do that using \[JsonPropertyName\(\)\], as shown here\:  
public class SubmitBook  
\{  
\[Required\]  
\[StringLength\(80, MinimumLength = 3\)\]  
\[JsonPropertyName\("title"\)\]  
public string? Title \{ get; set; \}  
\[StringLength\(5000\)\]  
\[JsonPropertyName\("description"\)\]  
public string? Description \{ get; set; \}  
\[Required\]  
\[StringLength\(80, MinimumLength = 3\)\]  
\[JsonPropertyName\("authorName"\)\]  
public string? Author \{ get; set; \}  
\[Range\(typeof\(decimal\), "0", "99999"\)\]  
\[JsonPropertyName\("price"\)\]  
public decimal Price \{ get; set; \}  
\[DisplayName\("Number of Pages"\)\]  
\[Range\(0, 9999, ErrorMessage = "Number of pages must be  
at least 0 and at most 9999"\)\]  
\[JsonPropertyName\("pagesCount"\)\]  
public int PagesCount \{ get; set; \}  
\} Implementing a POST web API call in Blazor WebAssembly 189  
Now, we need to write the send POST request logic in the BookForm.razor component inside  
the Pages folder\:  
1. Inject an instance of HttpClient at the top of the component and call it Http, and inject an  
instance of NavigationManager to navigate the user after the book is submitted successfully\:  
...  
@inject HttpClient Http  
@inject NavigationManager NavigatinManager  
...  
2. In the @code section, update the HandleBookFormSubmission method by removing  
the Console.WriteLine\(\) calls and add the submit POST request logic as follows\:  
...  
private async void HandleBookFormSubmission\(\)  
\{  
\_book.Description =  
await \_simpleMde.GetEditorValueAsync\(\);  
var response = await Http.PostAsJsonAsync\("books",  
\_book\);  
if \(response.IsSuccessStatusCode\)  
\{  
await ClearSavedStateAsync\(\);  
NavigationManager.NavigateTo\("/"\);  
\}  
else  
\{  
var error = await response.Content  
.ReadFromJsonAsync\<ApiErrorResponse\>\(\);  
Console.WriteLine\(error\);  
// TODO\: Handle the error  
\}  
\}  
...  
Let’s explain the changes. First, we removed all the logging calls to the console window; then,  
we used the HttpClient instance to send a POST request by calling PostAsJsonAsync.  
Because in the POST request, we are sending data to the web API, PostAsJsonAsync takes  
two parameters\: one is the endpoint we want to reach, and the other is the object we want to  
send as JSON. The method will serialize the object to JSON and send the request.  
We store the response in the response object. Then, as we did earlier, we validate the status of  
the response. If the response succeeded, that means the book has been added successfully. We  
then remove the saved objects to preserve the state using the ClearSavedStateAsync  
method and navigate the user to the Index page. 190  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
If the request fails, we basically deserialize the content of the response into an ApiErrorResponse  
object, and for now, just log the error on the console because we will learn how to handle errors  
efficiently in Chapter 10.  
Now, if you run the project with the API and navigate to /BookForm, populate the data, and hit  
Submit, you will be redirected to the Index page and see the new book in the list.  
With that, we have learned what’s needed to communicate with a web API using the HttpClient  
class. Next, we will explore the IhttpClientFactory service briefly, in addition to covering the  
delegating handlers, what they are, and when you need them.  
Now that we have made the calls and exposed our app to real data, let’s see how we can get that code  
clean so the components stay readable, small, and testable, as we will see in Chapter 13, Testing Blazor  
WebAssembly Apps.  
# Exploring IHttpClientFactory and delegating handlers  
IHttpClientFactory is a service that supports creating single or multiple HttpClient  
instances with custom configuration. We have used the HttpClient instance configured in the  
previous section with the web API base URL. This was enough to meet our basic needs, but sometimes  
slightly more advanced techniques are needed to cover the scenarios you may face while developing  
more complex apps.  
In this section, we will learn how to use the HttpClient factory to create and manage HttpClient  
instances. In addition, we will learn about DelegatingHandlers that allow for building a pipeline  
to process each HTTP request or response associated with a specific HttpClient instance and  
when we need such a capability.  
To be able to utilize the IHttpClientFactory service, we need to install the Microsoft.  
Extensions.Http package. You can do that either using the NuGet package manager or through  
the .NET CLI command\:  
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Http  
The first concept we will introduce is the named HttpClient instances. Currently, we have a new  
instance of HttpClient registered in the DI container. Using IHttpClientFactory, we can  
register one or more HttpClient instances with a name for each. Then, we can retrieve any of those  
HttpClient instances using the name we registered it with. So, in Program.cs, we will replace  
the line that manually registers HttpClient with the AddHttpClient method and give it the  
name BooksStore.Api, as follows\:  
...  
//builder.Services.AddScoped\(sp =\> new HttpClient \{ BaseAddress = new  
Uri\(builder.Configuration\["ApiUrl"\]\) \}\);  
builder.Services.AddHttpClient\("BooksStore.API", httpClient =\>  
httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri\(builder.Configuration\["ApiUrl"\]\)\);  
... Exploring IHttpClientFactory and delegating handlers 191  
As a result of the previous code, there are no HttpClient instances registered directly in the DI container.  
So, to be able to retrieve this instance of HttpClient you need to inject the IHttpClientFactory  
service, then use the CreateClient method, as shown in the following snippet\:  
@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory  
...  
using \(var httpClient =  
HttpClientFactory.CreateClient\("BooksStore.API"\)\)  
\{  
// Use the httpClient here  
\}  
This approach does require us to make some code changes wherever we inject an HttpClient  
instance. But because we only have one instance of HttpClient to use throughout the full project,  
we can retrieve this instance from the IHttpClientFactory service and register it in the DI  
container directly by adding this line to the Program.cs file\:  
...  
builder.Services.AddScoped\(sp =\>  
sp.GetRequiredService\<IHttpClientFactory\>\(\).CreateClient\("BooksStore.  
API"\)\);  
...  
The preceding line retrieves IHttpClientFactory and uses the CreateClient method to  
create the required HttpClient instance and then registers this in the DI container. With this  
implementation, no code changes are required for what we have accomplished in the previous sections.  
Every time you inject HttpClient, instead of creating a new instance in the way it did before, a  
new instance will now be created using the factory.  
We have now reached the same point we were at before this section, but the difference is that now we  
will add some features to that HttpClient instance, such as DelegatingHandler.  
What are delegating handlers? And why do we need them? As a simple definition, you can think of a  
delegating handler as a gateway that every HTTP request and response for a specific HttpClient  
instance will go through. This allows for a centralized place to manipulate the HTTP request or the  
response based on your needs. You can have one or a chain of delegating handlers associated with a  
single HttpClient so that each request or response goes from one handler to the next, where each  
delegating handler is responsible for a certain manipulation task.  
There are many scenarios where delegating handlers can be useful. Let’s take logging as an example.  
Let’s say you want to log each HTTP request and response – instead of writing these logs manually in  
each method where you send a request, you can build a delegating handler and write the logs there  
so every HTTP request will be logged. 192  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
In Chapter 9, we will learn about protected API endpoints, covering how, to be able to access them, we  
need to send an access token in the header of each HTTP request. In this scenario, a delegating handler  
is needed to centralize this process for all the requests. We will go over the authentication scenario in  
the next chapter in detail. To keep things simple for now and learn how to build a delegating handler,  
we will create a simple one that logs the URL of each request and the status code for each response;  
then, we will link that basic handler to the existing HttpClient instance that we have.  
To create this example logging delegating handler, create a new class in the root folder of the project  
with the name DemoLoggingHandler.cs, then add the following piece of code\:  
public class DemoLoggingHandler \: DelegatingHandler  
\{  
private readonly ILogger\<DemoLoggingHandler\> \_logger;  
public DemoLoggingHandler\(ILogger\<DemoLoggingHandler\>  
logger\)  
\{  
\_logger = logger;  
\}  
protected override async Task\<HttpResponseMessage\>  
SendAsync\(HttpRequestMessage request,  
CancellationToken cancellationToken\)  
\{  
\_logger.LogInformation\(\$"HTTP request sent  
\{request.Method\} \{request.RequestUri\}"\);  
var response = await base.SendAsync\(request,  
cancellationToken\);  
\_logger.LogInformation\(\$"HTTP response received  
\:\{response.StatusCode\}"\);  
return response;  
\}  
\}  
Building handlers is easy and straightforward\: just inherit from the DelegatingHandler  
class and override the SendAsync method that supplies the request as a parameter of type  
HttpRequestMessage. You can use this parameter to manipulate the request or the response as  
we did in the code after sending the request using the SendAsync method. Exploring IHttpClientFactory and delegating handlers 193  
The last thing we need to do is to attach DemoLoggingHandler to the HttpClient instance.  
In Program.cs, register an instance of DemoLoggingHandler to the DI container and use the  
AddHttpMessageHandler\<DemoLoggingHandler\> extension method to the AddHttpClient  
method as follows\:  
...  
builder.Services.AddScoped\<DemoLoggingHandler\>\(\);  
builder.Services.AddHttpClient\("BooksStore.API", httpClient =\>  
httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri\(builder.Configuration\["ApiUrl"\]\)\)  
.AddHttpMessageHandler\<DemoLoggingHandler\>\(\);  
...  
That’s all. Easy, right? Now run the project. In the index page, when the API request is sent to retrieve  
the books, and for every future API request we will add, you will automatically notice the following  
logs in the Console window of the browser dev tools\:  
Figure 8.9 – Logs from the delegating handler 194  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
We will build more on top of this in the next chapter, but for now, we have learned everything we need  
to get our Blazor WebAssembly app to communicate with web APIs. The last thing we will achieve  
in the next section is to take the code to send the API requests from within the components into a  
separate service, thus ensuring the readability and testability of the code.  
# Separating your API calls from the components  
Back in the Dependency Injection in Blazor WebAssembly section in Chapter 1, we created the  
IBooksService interface and an implementation for it called LocalBooksService. The goal  
was to make the components rely on the IBooksService interface and not the implementation,  
which can be changed. The code to call the web API endpoints is somewhat long and repeatable,  
in addition to making the components depend on an instance of HttpClient, which makes the  
components hard to test and have longer code.  
The goal in this section is to migrate the calls we made in the previous two sections to IBooksService  
and create a new implementation for it that communicates with the web API. Finally, we will write  
some code to fetch some book details from the API using book IDs.  
So, let’s get started\:  
1. In the IBooksService interface in the Services folder, we need to add a new method  
called AddBookAsync that takes a SubmitBook object as a parameter. The method won’t  
return anything – it either passes and the book is added successfully, or it fails and it will throw  
an exception\:  
public interface IBooksService  
\{  
Task\<List\<Book\>\> GetAllBooksAsync\(\);  
Task\<Book?\> GetBookByIdAsync\(string? id\);  
Task AddBookAsync\(SubmitBook book\);  
\}  
2\. 3. In the Services folder, create a new C\# class and call BooksHttpClientService.  
cs, which will be an implementation for IBooksService but communicate with the API  
instead of a local list.  
Inside BooksHttpClientService.cs, implement the IBooksService interface and  
inject an instance of type HttpClient\:  
using BooksStore.Models;  
using System.Net.Http.Json;  
namespace BooksStore.Services;  
public class BooksHttpClientService \: IBooksService  
\{ 4\. 5. Separating your API calls from the components 195  
private readonly HttpClient \_httpClient;  
public BooksHttpClientService\(HttpClient  
httpClient\)  
\{  
\_httpClient = httpClient;  
\}  
\}  
Implement the GetAllBooksAsync method, copy the code written in the Index page to  
call the web API, and put it inside the method, as shown here\:  
...  
public async Task\<List\<Book\>?\> GetAllBooksAsync\(\)  
\{  
var response =  
await \_httpClient.GetAsync\("books"\);  
if \(response.IsSuccessStatusCode\)  
// if response status code is 2XX  
\{  
return await response.Content  
.ReadFromJsonAsync\<List\<Book\>\>\(\);  
\}  
else  
\{  
var errorResponse = await response.Content  
.ReadFromJsonAsync\<ApiErrorResponse\>\(\);  
// Throw an exception with the error  
// message for now  
throw new  
Exception\(errorResponse?.Message\);  
\}  
\}  
...  
The API exposes a get book by id endpoint, which is a GET request and is accessible through  
the /books/\{Book\_Id\} route. If the request succeeds, it returns the same Book object  
that the /books endpoint returns. So, we can replicate the call but change the return type to  
a single book and add the ID to the route as follows\:  
public async Task\<Book?\> GetBookByIdAsync\(string?  
id\)  
\{  
var response = await  
\_httpClient.GetAsync\(\$"books/\{id\}"\); 196  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
if \(response.IsSuccessStatusCode\)  
// if response status code is 2XX  
\{  
return await  
response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync\<Book\>\(\);  
\}  
else  
\{  
var errorResponse = await  
response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync  
\<ApiErrorResponse\>\(\);  
throw new  
Exception\(errorResponse?.Message\);  
\}  
\}  
6. We still have to implement AddBookAsync, so we need to bring the HTTP call we made  
in BookForm and paste it inside the form, but make sure to remove the component-related  
code, such as navigation and clearing the state, because in this service we just need the code  
to call the API\:  
public async Task AddBookAsync\(SubmitBook book\)  
\{  
var response = await  
\_httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync\("books", book\);  
if \(!response.IsSuccessStatusCode\)  
\{  
var error = await  
response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync  
\<ApiErrorResponse\>\(\);  
Console.WriteLine\(error\);  
\}  
\}  
7\. 8. After sending the request, if it succeeds, then no action is needed in the service here; we just  
need to handle the failure.  
Because we have a new implementation for IBooksService, we can register the dependency  
injection container to use an instance of the BooksHttpClientService instead  
of LocalBooksService.  
In Program.cs, comment out the existing line and add a new one, as shown here\:  
...  
//builder.Services.AddScoped\<IBooksService,  
LocalBooksService\>\(\); Separating your API calls from the components 197  
builder.Services.AddScoped\<IBooksService,  
BooksHttpClientService\>\(\);  
...  
9. The service is ready, and to use the web API calls, we just need to inject an instance of  
IBooksService. Now we need to clean the calls we made earlier.  
In Index.razor, remove the injection of the HttpClient instance, remove the  
GetBooksAsync method, and change the call inside OnInitializeAsync to be as follows\:  
protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync\(\)  
\{  
...  
\_books = await BooksService.GetAllBooksAsync\(\);  
//\_books = await GetBooksAsync\(\);  
\}  
10. The preceding code is back to its original state. We worked through this whole exercise so you  
could get a deeper understanding of the service separation and remain focused on making the  
API calls at the initial state, then worry about making it clean later.  
The same thing needs to be repeated in the BookForm component. We will remove the  
HttpClient injection and inject IBooksService instead\:  
...  
@inject IBooksService BooksService  
...  
11\. Refactor the HandleBookFormSubmission method as follows\:  
private async void HandleBookFormSubmission\(\)  
\{  
\_book.Description =  
await \_simpleMde.GetEditorValueAsync\(\);  
await BooksService.AddBookAsync\(\_book\);  
await ClearSavedStateAsync\(\);  
NavigationManager.NavigateTo\("/"\);  
\}  
You can see here that there is no error handling and no data is returned, and that’s because the  
AddBookAsync method either adds the book successfully and doesn’t return anything, or  
fails and throws an exception, which we will handle in Chapter 11.  
The code difference between having the API calls within the components and separating them into  
external services is significant. When the calls are separated, there are no long, repeated API calls  
inside the components and they don’t depend on an instance of HttpClient anymore. However, the 198  
Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly  
components we have refactored now depend on an interface of the IBooksService type. Chapter 13,  
Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps, will detail how this makes our component much more testable.  
We have come a long way, right? Our application is now more interactive and has better code, and  
there is less fake or simulation logic. We have leveled up by starting to think about how the code looks  
and how long it is, and trying to make it as small as possible so that instead of having code that just  
works, we get code that works efficiently and looks great too.  
# Summary  
We started this chapter by explaining the concept of web APIs regardless of your level of expertise so  
that you could get a deeper understanding of what they are and why you need them. Then, we moved  
on to the practical side of things by introducing the tools and utilities available to make API calls from  
a .NET app. We implemented two API calls\: one to fetch data from the API and another to submit  
data to the API. Finally, we went over what we did, refactored it, and learned about the correct place  
for the API calls to reside so we have more testable code and better-coded components.  
After going through the content and examples in this chapter, you should be able to consume your web  
APIs on your own and integrate your apps with third-party APIs to enrich the experience of your users.  
The following is what you should have gained from this chapter\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The ability to identify what web APIs are from the client perspective and why they are needed  
Read and understood the documentation of APIs, identified the available endpoints, and now  
know how to analyze and test them  
Learned how to make web API calls efficiently from your Blazor WebAssembly project  
Explored and used IHttpClientFactory alongside DelegatingHandler  
Learned how to separate your calls into different services for better code readability and testability  
Now that we have exposed the app to an online service, in the next chapter, we are going to get some  
users into the system and allow them to create new accounts and log in. We also need to protect some  
pages and restrict access to some functionality to the admin only. In the upcoming chapter, we will  
deep dive into how to secure our Blazor WebAssembly app.

# Authenticatiwng and  
# Authorizing Users in Blazor  
All the features we have built and learned about so far are for any user who loads the app in the  
browser. Well, in real-world applications, that’s not always the case. In most of the scenarios you will  
face, some features require the app to know who is using it, and in other cases, the full app cannot be  
used until it knows who is using it.  
In this chapter, we are going to learn about authentication and how it happens on the client side, what  
authentication means, and how we can implement it in Blazor WebAssembly.  
We will explore the Blazor authentication library in depth, alongside most of its capabilities that enable  
you to build enterprise-level single-page applications. To understand everything in detail, we will build  
a custom authentication flow. After building the core, we will take advantage of the authentication  
library to restrict access to some pages to only logged-in users, show or hide partial content in the  
UI, and control the logic of a component based on the user’s identity. After that, we will implement  
role-based access control to restrict some features in the app for specific roles. If this is not enough  
for our use case, we will go further and discuss authorization policies and put them into practice.  
Another point to discuss is calling secured API endpoints from the client by sending the token with  
each HTTP request. Finally, we will take a look at the Microsoft Identity Platform and services such  
as Azure Active Directory and Active Directory Business-to-Customer \(B2C\) and what benefits  
they will give us if we use them with Blazor.

# Understanding authentication in Blazor WebAssembly  
With the word authentication, probably the first thing that comes to your mind is the login process  
with a username and password. I think that’s mostly right, but the story is a bit deeper than that.  
An overall general definition for authentication is validating whether the user or the system that  
is trying to access certain protected resources has a valid identity or not. Think of authentication as  
an employee trying to access a company office. The employee passes the work ID over the scanner  
beside the main entrance. The system then checks whether it is a valid ID and, if it is, the door opens  
and allows the employee in. The employee gets their work ID in the onboarding process after getting  
hired, so you can map the entrance validation to the login process and the issuing of the ID to the  
registration process in the software world.  
Authentication is not only for users \(actual people who open and use the app\). It can also be against  
another system. When two systems are trying to communicate with each other and system A is accessing  
protected data or executing protected actions with system B, then system B has to authenticate system  
A to make sure it’s the actual system that has the right to access the requested resources. All these  
authentication processes happen in the backend and mostly between APIs, which is a bit beyond the  
scope of this book. Understanding authentication in Blazor WebAssembly 201  
It’s good to differentiate between authentication on the client side and the server side. On the client  
side, authentication doesn’t guarantee security. The actual security processes of the system occur on  
the server side when we ask the API to execute an action or return some data. At that moment, the  
API checks whether we are eligible to execute the action or are the rightful owners of this data. On the  
client side, especially on apps that run in the browser, authentication doesn’t strictly mean security;  
rather, it means showing and hiding UI elements based on the user’s identity. The stuff being controlled  
is just pure UI, such as not showing a page, a link in the nav menu, or a button that executes an action  
to non-admin users. However, always keep in mind that client-side authentication can be bypassed,  
so the actual security of the data and the system is on the server.  
In relation to single-page applications, which we are focusing on in this book, our authentication  
target is the person who is using our app. In the case of the BooksStore app that we are building,  
not all the features require an authenticated user. For example, if someone opens the URL of our app  
and browses the books, that should be fine and we don’t need to know who that user is exactly, but if  
the user wants to buy a book or write a book review, then we need to know who this person is.  
Another part of the system is admin. Certain employees of our books library should have admin access  
to the system so that they can manage the books \(add, edit, and delete\), so to access this part of the  
system, they must be authenticated. So, we can see that our system has some pages, such as the book  
details page, that can be accessed without authentication, but some features inside it must be blocked,  
such as writing a review. Other pages, such as the page for adding a new book, cannot be accessed at  
all without a user being logged in.  
So, how can we get this stuff done? Maybe that’s the question you have in mind right now. A naïve  
solution will be as follows\:  
1\. 2. 3. 4. Create a login page that includes email and password fields and a submit button.  
Send a POST request to the API with the email and password, and it should retrieve a user  
object if it finds one.  
Store the user object somewhere in a static class called UserState, for example.  
Then, the user is authenticated if the user object inside the UserState class is not null.  
That seems cool, but the actual process is not 100% straightforward in the way that the preceding list  
suggests. Fortunately, Blazor provides you with all the infrastructure needed to enable authentication  
in your app efficiently.  
Next, we will discover what Blazor offers us out of the box to build an authentication system for our  
single-page application, and how to utilize those utilities.  
It’s good to know that Blazor WebAssembly runs fully in the browser, so authentication will mostly  
mean showing or hiding a functionality or page to or from a user based on certain conditions, which  
we will see later, but keep in mind that all client-side in-browser authorization can be bypassed in one  
way or another. So, your API security can enforce the security rules needed. 202  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
Token-based authentication \(TBA\)  
In Blazor WebAssembly and almost every other single-page application framework, it’s common to  
use what’s called TBA. TBA is simply an authentication method that uses a token fetched from an  
identity provider \(your web API or an external identity provider such as Azure Active Directory\) after  
the user logs in successfully. This token is an encoded JSON string that represents some data about  
the user, in addition to a signature confirming the validity of the token; this token is also known as  
a JSON Web Token \(JWT\). The Blazor WebAssembly app gets the token, parses it, extracts the user  
data, which is known as claims, constructs a user object out of those claims, then stores the token in  
the protected browser storage.  
The following screenshot shows a sample JWT, decoded using the https\://jwt.ms online utility.  
Figure 9.1 – JWT decoded  
As you can see in the preceding screenshot, the first box contains the raw token, which consists of  
three main parts\:  
•  
The first part, which is highlighted in red, represents the type of token and the hashing algorithm  
it uses.  
•  
The second long part, highlighted in blue, represents the token payload or the data it holds that  
the identity server has exchanged with the Blazor app. Understanding authentication in Blazor WebAssembly 203  
•  
The third part, highlighted in green, represents the signature of the token. Basically, this is the  
previous parts combined and encrypted with a specific key.  
Decoding the token and extracting the claims from the payload and building a user object out of them  
is what enables the Blazor WebAssembly app to mark a user as authenticated. Then, the token can  
be stored in the protected browser storage and used in each HTTP request sent to the API to access  
the protected endpoints.  
When we use the term “user claims,” we are referring to a key-value pair that defines the user. In  
Figure 9.1, in the Decoded Token section, you can see a JSON object highlighted in blue. This object  
contains a set of properties along with their values, which are called claims. Some examples of claims  
include email addresses, name identifiers \(IDs\), given names, and surnames. There are also special  
claims, such as exp, which represents the expiry date of the token.  
Now that we’ve introduced TBA, let’s see what Blazor provides to achieve the aforementioned logic  
in the code.  
The Blazor authentication library  
Blazor provides the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication package,  
which wraps all the required utilities to support authentication and authorization in your apps. The  
package contains classes and services that support different scenarios and authentication protocols,  
such as OpenID Connect \(OIDC\). OIDC is a big topic to explain, but in a nutshell, it’s the protocol  
you see when you use any app that allows you to authenticate using your Facebook or Google account.  
When you click Login with Google, for example, the app redirects you to Google and you log in with  
your Google account, then it directs you back to the app and you are logged in successfully. OIDC  
is also based on JWT, so the authentication will be achieved as mentioned in the previous chapter.  
Alongside the aforementioned library, Blazor WebAssembly uses some capabilities from the ASP.  
NET Core authentication library, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization. Both libraries provide all  
the ingredients to support all authentication scenarios, and here are some of the classes, attributes,  
and components the packages contain that help achieve the authentication mechanism\:  
•  
•  
AuthenticationStateProvider class\: This is the core of the authentication process. It  
provides a method called GetAuthenticationStateAsync, which is used to build an  
AuthenticationState object containing a property called User of the ClaimsPrincipal  
type, and this is what wraps the claims of the user. It also has an event that gets triggered when  
the authentication state changes in the app.  
\[Authorize\] attribute\: This is used to secure pages. When we declare a page with \[Authorize\],  
if the user is not logged in, they won’t be able to access this page. 204  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
•  
•  
AuthorizeRouteView component\: In the Building layouts in Blazor section in Chapter 3, we  
talked about a default component called RouteView used in the App.razor component.  
When your app is using authentication, you should consider using AuthorizeRouteView  
instead, as this will check whether the requested page requires authentication or not.  
AuthorizedView component\: This component helps us render specific content based on the  
user’s authentication status.  
•  
CascadingAuthenticationState component\: This can be used to wrap all other components  
in the App.razor component. It provides the Task\<AuthenticationState\> object  
as a cascading parameter to any ascending component that wants to access the current user  
identity state and the user claims.  
Throughout this book, we have started from the very basic components and kept going until we have  
reached the target and built the advanced component we are looking for. The same process will be  
followed now, so after introducing the theoretical part, let’s get started putting all those components  
together to make our app secure.  
# Building a custom JWT authentication flow  
This is the section that will contain all the action! We will put together everything we have learned  
so far about developing components and forms and calling a web API, in addition to all the parts we  
mentioned in the previous section, to add authentication to our BooksStore project.  
For this exercise, we will use the /authentication/login POST API endpoint. This endpoint  
will accept an object with two properties – Username and Password. If they are valid, it will return  
an object containing the access token.  
By default, the API has two users registered that we can use to test\:  
•  
John Smith\: He is an admin in the company. His email is admin@masteringblazor.com  
and his password is Test.123.  
•  
Ahmad Mozaffar\: He is a customer of the BooksStore library. His email is ahmad.  
mozaffar@masteringblazor.com and his password is Test.123.  
The custom flow we will build will consider the user authenticated when there is a valid token stored  
in the local storage of the browser.  
Let’s summarize the plan we will go over in this section to achieve custom TBA\:  
1\. 2. 3. Understand and call the login endpoint of the API to fetch the access token.  
Design and implement a page with the login form.  
Build a JWT authentication state provider and set up the authentication infrastructure. Building a custom JWT authentication flow 205  
4\. 5. Integrate the authentication provider with the form.  
Enable authentication for the FetchData page to test the flow.  
So, let’s get started.  
Calling the login endpoint  
As we learned in Chapter 8, Consuming Web APIs from Blazor WebAssembly, the first thing we should  
do before calling an endpoint is understand it. Let’s run the API project and check the Swagger page  
to see what there is.  
You can see in the Authentication section that there is an endpoint called /Authentication/  
login with the specs, as you can see in the following screenshot from Swagger\:  
Figure 9.2 – Login endpoint in the BooksStore API 206  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
So, it’s a simple POST request that takes an object with a username and password and then retrieves  
an API response object wrapping a login response object that contains the token property, which is  
what we want. If there is a failure, as mentioned in the Sending a GET request section in Chapter 8, all  
the API requests that fail will retrieve an ApiErrorResponse object that we have already created.  
We can test it either with Postman or directly from the Swagger page with one of the two users I  
mentioned earlier. Click on Try it out in the top right of the request details, and then fill the request  
body with the following JSON\:  
\{  
"username"\: "admin@masteringblazor.com",  
"password"\: "Test.123"  
\}  
Click Execute and then, in the Responses section, you should see the JSON response with the token  
inside, as shown here\:  
Figure 9.3 – Login endpoint response with the access token  
You can copy the token value from the response and paste it into https\://jwt.ms. You can see  
the claims in the decoded part, as we saw in Figure 9.1. Building a custom JWT authentication flow 207  
Now, we have a clear idea of how this endpoint works, what it expects, and what it returns to us. Let’s  
translate this into code that sends the request from our Blazor WebAssembly project\:  
1. We will start by creating the class of the object to send in the body of the request. In the Models  
folder, create a new class called LoginRequest.cs with two properties, as shown in the  
following snippet\:  
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;  
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;  
public class LoginRequest  
\{  
\[Required\]  
\[JsonPropertyName\("username"\)\]  
public string Username \{ get; set; \} =  
string.Empty;  
\[Required\]  
\[StringLength\(16, MinimumLength = 5\)\]  
\[JsonPropertyName\("password"\)\]  
public string Password \{ get; set; \} =  
string.Empty;  
\}  
2. Because the same object will be used in the form we will create later, we added a data annotation  
for validation, such as specifying that the field is mandatory and the maximum and minimum  
length of the password.  
Create another class in the Models folder called LoginResponse\:  
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;  
public class LoginResponse  
\{  
\[JsonPropertyName\("token"\)\]  
public string? AccessToken \{ get; set; \}  
\[JsonPropertyName\("refreshToken"\)\]  
public string? RefreshToken \{ get; set; \}  
\}  
3. Within the Services folder, create an interface called IAuthenticationService with  
one method inside\:  
namespace BooksStore.Services;  
public interface IAuthenticationService  
\{  
Task\<LoginResponse\> LoginUserAsync\(LoginRequest 208  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
requestModel\);  
\}  
4\. As we said in the Separating API calls from components section in Chapter 8, we will keep the  
API calls wrapped inside interfaces and away from the component to keep our components  
clean and testable, as we will see in Chapter 13, Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps.  
Create the implementation of IAuthenticationService. In the Services folder  
again, create a new class called AuthenticationService. The class will implement the  
IAuthenticationService interface and contains the implementation of LoginUserAsync,  
which sends the requests to the login endpoint in the API, as shown here\:  
using BooksStore.Models;  
using System.Net.Http.Json;  
namespace BooksStore.Services;  
public class AuthenticationService \:  
IAuthenticationService  
\{  
// Inject the HttpClient into the constructor  
private readonly HttpClient \_httpClient;  
public AuthenticationService\(HttpClient  
httpClient\)  
\{  
\_httpClient = httpClient;  
\}  
public async Task\<LoginResponse\>  
LoginUserAsync\(LoginRequest requestModel\)  
\{  
var response = await \_httpClient  
.PostAsJsonAsync\("authentication/login",  
requestModel\);  
if \(response.IsSuccessStatusCode\)  
\{  
return await response.Content  
.ReadFromJsonAsync\<LoginResponse\>\(\);  
\}  
else  
\{  
var error = await response.Content  
.ReadFromJsonAsync\<ApiErrorResponse\>\(\);  
Console.WriteLine\(error\); Building a custom JWT authentication flow 209  
throw new Exception\(error.Message\);  
// TODO\: Handle the error in a proper way  
\}  
\}  
\}  
5. So, the code inside the method is a typical HTTP request to the API. In the Managing API  
errors section in Chapter 10, Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly, we will learn how to  
efficiently handle those errors.  
In Program.cs, register IAuthenticationService in the dependency injection  
container so we can inject it into the login component later\:  
...  
builder.Services.AddScoped\<IAuthenticationService,  
AuthenticationService\>\(\);  
await builder.Build\(\).RunAsync\(\);  
That’s all for this section. Now it’s time to build the login form that will call the LoginUserAsync  
method we just created.  
Designing the login form page  
To let users \(normal customers or admins\) log in, we need to provide them with a login page with a  
form to submit their username and password.  
So, the goal of this step is to get a page that looks like the following screenshot\:  
Figure 9.4 – User login page 210  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
We will start by designing the UI and then we will implement the logic for submitting the form.  
Let’s switch to Visual Studio and get that component done\:  
1\. 2. In the Pages folder, we will create another folder and call it Authentication. This is the  
folder where all the pages related to authentication will reside, such as for login, registration,  
and password reset.  
Inside the Authentication folder, create a new Razor component and call it Login.  
This will represent the login page, so it needs a router and a page title, and we will apply the  
UserLayout for it, as shown here\:  
@page "/authentication/login"  
@layout UserLayout  
\<PageTitle\>Login to BooksStore\</PageTitle\>  
...  
3. In the @code section, create a variable of the LoginRequest type and call it \_model. This  
will represent the object we will bind to the form. We started with this object before creating  
the markup because, as we learned in the Understanding forms in Blazor section in Chapter 5,  
Capturing User Input with Forms and Validation, the EditForm component requires its Model  
property to be populated to function or even be rendered in the UI\:  
...  
@code \{  
private LoginRequest \_model = new\(\);  
\}  
4. Now, let’s create the markup with an EditForm component, DataAnnotionsValidator,  
two InputText components, and two ValidationMessage components to represent  
the login form with its validation capability\:  
...  
\<h2\>Welcome to BooksStore!\</h2\>  
\<div class="row"\>  
\<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4"\>  
\<EditForm Model="\_model"\>  
\<DataAnnotationsValidator /\>  
\<div class="mb-3"\>  
\<label\>Username\</label\>  
\<InputText  
@bind-Value="@\_model.Username"  
class="form-control" /\>  
\<ValidationMessage For="@\(\(\) =\>  
\_model.Username\)" /\> Building a custom JWT authentication flow 211  
\</div\>  
\<div class="mb-3"\>  
\<label\>Password\</label\>  
\<InputText type="password"  
@bind-Value="@\_model.Password"  
class="form-control" /\>  
\<ValidationMessage For="@\(\(\) =\>  
\_model.Password\)" /\>  
\</div\>  
\<button type="submit"  
class="btn btn-primary"\>Login\</button\>  
\</EditForm\>  
\</div\>  
\</div\>  
...  
We have used some Bootstrap CSS classes for the overall design, but what matters here is how  
we bind the values of the two inputs to the Username and Password properties of the  
LoginRequest model.  
Now, you can run the project; navigate to /authentication/login, and you should see a form  
identical to the one shown in Figure 9.4. The form also supports validation when you click Login, as  
we designed it with the attributes of the LoginRequest class.  
After getting the design ready, the second phase is to write the logic of submitting the form. We will  
call the LoginUserAsync method we created, check whether the token is retrieved, and then store  
it in the local storage of the browser\:  
1\. Inject IauthenticationService and ILocalStorageService\:  
...  
@using Blazored.LocalStorage  
@inject IAuthenticationService AuthService  
@inject ILocalStorageService LocalStorage  
...  
2. In the @code section, create a new method called SubmitLoginFormAsync and add the  
following logic to it\:  
...  
private async Task SubmitLoginFormAsync\(\)  
\{  
try  
\{ 212  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
// Based on the logic of the method, if the  
// request to the API fails, it will throw an  
// exception, otherwise it will return the  
// token.  
var loginResult = await  
AuthService.LoginUserAsync\(\_model\);  
// Store the token in the local storage  
await LocalStorage.SetItemAsync\(  
"access\_token", loginResult.AccessToken\);  
// TODO\: Trigger the Blazor app to refresh the  
// authentication state, To be Handled in the  
// next step  
Navigation.NavigateTo\("/"\);  
\}  
catch \(Exception ex\)  
\{  
// TODO\: Log the error in Chapter 11  
Console.WriteLine\(ex.Message\);  
\}  
\}  
...  
3. The preceding logic is straightforward\: call LoginUserAsync and pass the \_model used  
in the form as a parameter. If the token is retrieved successfully, we store it within the table  
storage and then navigate to the home page. If there’s a failure, for the time being, we just log  
it into the console, but in the next chapter, we will learn how to properly deal with failures.  
Assign the SubmitFormAsync method to the EventCallback OnValidSubmit  
parameter of the EditForm component in the markup section\:  
...  
\<EditForm Model="\_model"  
OnValidSubmit="SubmitLoginFormAsync"\>  
...  
This is everything that’s needed for this step. Run the API project and the Blazor WebAssembly project,  
navigate to /authentication/login, and try admin@masteringblazor.com for the  
username and Test.123 for the password. After clicking the Login button, you will be taken to  
the Index page, but if you access Developer Tools in your browser and check the local storage, you  
will find the access token stored there\: Building a custom JWT authentication flow 213  
Figure 9.5 – The access token stored in the local storage after successful sign-in  
So, the question now is what has changed in the system if this access\_token value in the local  
storage is simply a string value? In the next step, we will decode this token, extract the claims from  
it, and let the Blazor app build the user identity out of this token.  
Building the authentication state provider and setting up the  
authentication infrastructure  
It’s time to work on what will make the authentication happen. Everything so far has been geared  
toward getting the token and providing the user with the required UI to log in.  
What is the general goal here? We want to implement an authentication state provider. This service  
will allow us to write the authentication logic we are aiming for. In our case, the authentication logic  
will be based on the access token value stored in the local storage. Follow these steps to process it\:  
1\. 2. Check whether the local storage contains the access token value.  
Decode that access token and extract the claims from it.  
3\. 4. 5. 6. Build a ClaimsPrincipal object that represents the user with its claims.  
Notify the app about that change in the authentication state.  
Return a new AuthenticationState object that contains the user.  
If there is no token or the token is invalid for some reason, just return an empty  
AuthenitcationState object with no claims.  
After building the authentication state provider, we will register it in the DI container, enable authentication  
in Program.cs, and finally, make some modifications to the App.razor component so our app  
has a full authentication mechanism. 214  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
Two packages are needed to get this work done\:  
•  
•  
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authorization\: This is the package that has  
the AuthenticationStateProvider abstract class and the other authentication components.  
System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt\: This has the JwtSecurityTokenHandler class. We  
will use a method inside it called ReadJwtToken to parse the access token and extract the  
claims from it.  
You can install the packages either using NuGet in Visual Studio or using the dotnet CLI via the  
following command\:  
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.  
Authorization  
dot add package System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt  
Everything is ready for us now, so let’s get into it\:  
1. In the root folder of the project, add a new class called JwtCustomAuthentication-  
StateProvider that inherits from AuthenticationStateProvider, add some  
usings to be used, and add the following code inside\:  
using Blazored.LocalStorage;  
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization;  
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;  
using System.Security.Claims;  
namespace BooksStore;  
public class JwtAuthenticationStateProvider \:  
AuthenticationStateProvider  
\{  
public async override Task\<AuthenticationState\>  
GetAuthenticationStateAsync\(\)  
\{  
\}  
\}  
2\. Inject ILocalStorageService to read the token from the local storage\:  
private readonly ILocalStorageService \_storage;  
public JwtAuthenticationStateProvider\(  
ILocalStorageService storage\) 3\. 4. 5. Building a custom JWT authentication flow 215  
\{  
\_storage = storage;  
\}  
In the body of the GetAuthenticationStateAsync method, we will start by  
checking whether access\_token exists in the local storage. If not, we will return an  
AuthenticationState object with an empty ClaimsPrincipal object inside, which  
will indicate that the user is not authenticated\:  
...  
public async override Task\<AuthenticationState\>  
GetAuthenticationStateAsync\(\)  
\{  
if \(await  
\_storage.ContainKeyAsync\("access\_token"\)\)  
\{  
// Process the token here  
\}  
var anonymousUser = new ClaimsPrincipal\(new  
ClaimsIdentity\(\)\); // Empty claims and  
// authentication scheme provided  
var anonymousAuthState = new  
AuthenticationState\(anonymousUser\);  
NotifyAuthenticationStateChanged\(  
Task.FromResult\(anonymousAuthState\)\);  
return anonymousAuthState;  
\}  
...  
Inside the if block, we will get the access token value and parse it using the  
JwtSecurityTokenHandler class\:  
// Read and parse the token  
var tokenAsString = await  
\_storage.GetItemAsync\<string\>\("access\_token"\);  
var tokenHandler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler\(\);  
var token = tokenHandler.ReadJwtToken\(tokenAsString\);  
We need to create a new ClaimsIdentity object. This object represents the user claims  
extracted from the token, and the name of the authentication scheme, which is jwt in our case\:  
var identity = new ClaimsIdentity\(token.Claims,  
"jwt"\); 216  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
6\. We can add some validation to the values of the claims to make sure the token is valid and to  
check for the expiration date, but to keep things simple and straightforward, I have excluded  
this step for now because we are going to talk about that in the last section.  
The last thing we need to build is a ClaimsPrincipal object out of the identity  
object we just created, then a new AuthenticationState object, and call the  
NotifyAuthenticationStateChanged method, which is a method from the base  
class that will notify other components that the authentication state has changed. Finally, we  
need to return the authState object\:  
var user = new ClaimsPrincipal\(identity\);  
var authState = new AuthenticationState\(user\);  
NotifyAuthenticationStateChanged\(Task.FromResult\(  
authState\)\);  
return authState;  
7\. The preceding code is the engine of the authentication system that we are building.  
In Program.cs, add the authentication state provider to the DI container, and also add the  
required authentication services by using AddAuthorizationCore as follows\:  
...  
builder.Services.AddAuthorizationCore\(\);  
builder.Services.AddScoped\<AuthenticationStateProvider,  
JwtAuthenticationStateProvider\>\(\);  
...  
8. The Blazor app now knows how to authenticate our users, but components from the Blazor  
authentication library are needed in App.razor to complete the story. We need to wrap  
all the components in App.razor with the \<CascadingAuthenticationState\>  
component. This makes the authentication state object include the identity state and makes  
the claims available through a cascading parameter for any component\:  
...  
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization  
\<CascadingAuthenticationState\>  
\<Router ...  
\</CascadingAuthenticationState\>  
9. Another important change in App.razor is replacing the \<RouteView\> component  
with AuthorizeRouteView. This component provides an authentication check for  
protected URLs; for example, if the user is not logged in and trying to access a protected page,  
AuthorizeRouteView allows you to customize what should happen in this case\:  
...  
\<AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData"  
DefaultLayout="@typeof\(UserLayout\)"\> 10\. 11. 12. Building a custom JWT authentication flow 217  
\<NotAuthorized\>  
\<h3\>You don't have the permissions to access  
this page\</h3\>  
\<br /\>  
\<a href="authentication/login"  
class="btn btn-primary"\>Login\</a\>  
\</NotAuthorized\>  
\</AuthorizeRouteView\>  
...  
AuthorizeRouteView has a RenderFragment parameter called NotAuthorized.  
We use it to render what will be rendered in the UI if the user is not authenticated. We also  
have set the default layout of all pages to UserLayout.  
Many of the classes, components, and attributes in the authentication namespaces will be used  
in many components. So, we don’t have to add the @using directive for those namespaces  
in each component. Open \_Imports.razor in the root folder and add the following  
two namespaces\:  
...  
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization;  
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization  
...  
We are almost there! The last step here is to call GetAuthenticateStateAsync from  
the authentication state provider we built within the Login page after the token is fetched and  
stored, which will trigger the app to evaluate the authentication state based on the stored token.  
To do that, we just need to inject AuthenticationStateProvider and call the method  
inside the Login.razor page\:  
...  
@inject AuthenticationStateProvider AuthStateProvider  
And within the @code section and the SubmitFormAsync method, we will get  
GetAuthenticationStateAsync after storing the token in the local storage and before  
redirecting the user to the home page\:  
...  
await AuthStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync\(\);  
Navigation.NavigateTo\("/"\);  
... 218  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
With that, our system has a full authentication mechanism. That was a bit long, but that’s how Blazor  
WebAssembly handles it natively. In the next section, we will see how powerful this is. It took us some  
time to get here, but next, we will secure some pages and some parts of the UI, as well as implement  
roles and policies. All of this will be easy from now on, as what we have set up so far is the core, and  
what’s left is leveraging the available classes and components that depend on this infrastructure to  
complete the authentication system.  
If you run the project and navigate to the login page, then enter your credentials, you will be redirected  
to the home page. Nothing is noticeable so far because our app doesn’t have any secured pages or UI  
components yet.  
To make sure everything is working as expected, we will try to make accessing the FetchData  
page require you to be an authenticated user. It’s as simple as decorating the component with the  
\[Authorize\] attribute. In the Pages folder, open FetchData.razor and add the following  
at the top of the page\:  
@page "/fetchdata"  
...  
@attribute \[Authorize\]  
...  
When you run the app and navigate to the FetchData page, if you are logged in \(i.e., a valid token  
exists in the local storage\), you can see the weather forecast data normally, but if you are not logged  
in, you should see something like the following page\:  
Figure 9.6 – The unauthorized view when accessing a protected page  
Note  
We haven’t implemented the logout feature yet. If you logged in already earlier in this chapter,  
you could just open the local storage in Developer Tools in your browser and remove the  
access\_token key from there, then refresh the page, so the app will not consider you logged in. Implementing authorization and advanced authentication features 219  
Cool! Our authentication system is working, but is that everything? The answer is absolutely not!  
Blazor, with its authentication library, has too many things left to offer. In the next section, we will  
learn how to leverage roles and custom policies in our app, implement logout, control the render of  
the UI to show or hide some UI elements based on the authentication status, and much more.  
# Implementing authorization and advanced authentication  
# features  
We now have a new term to learn about – authorization. We have mentioned authentication many  
times, but what is authorization? It is a mechanism on top of authentication that restricts access to  
resources even for authenticated users.  
We gave the example of an employee being allowed access to their company building because they  
proved that they are an employee. That’s authentication. Authorization, on the other hand, means  
the employee cannot access all the departments inside the building. They require a special role, or  
permission, to do that.  
In software, the same concepts apply\: the user is authenticated after successfully logging in, but  
authorization means that the user cannot take certain actions or access certain features without a  
specific role or permission.  
In this section, we will discover how to implement authorization using the Blazor authentication  
library with roles or policies. After that, we will deep-dive into some scenarios that you will encounter  
in almost every app you build.  
Roles and policies  
In the BooksStore project, we have two types of users\: the system admins and the customers who  
want to buy books.  
Admins can access the BookForm page we built in Chapter 5 to insert a new book, and, of course,  
they can access anything else in the system. Customers don’t have access to the BookForm page, or  
any feature in the system related to managing the books; they can only browse the library, buy books,  
and review them.  
The infrastructure we have set up so far already supports roles, but the question is where are the roles  
of the users coming from? You know that the token has a set of claims that represents the user, and  
the API issues the token that contains the role claims. If you copy the access token fetched from the  
local storage and paste it into https\://jwt.ms, you will notice the role claim there\: 220  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
Figure 9.7 – Role claim in the access token for the admin user  
If you try to log in with the other account, ahmad.mozaffar@masteringblazor.com, you  
will notice the role claim has a value of Customer. Blazor WebAssembly recognizes this as the role  
of the user. A token can have multiple role claims, and that’s totally fine.  
So, how we can take advantage of that? Well, like everything else in Blazor, it’s super simple. Let’s  
restrict the BookForm page so that it can be accessed by admins only. In the Pages folder, open  
the BookForm.razor file, and add the \[Authorize\] attribute. Populate the Roles property  
with a value of Admin, as follows\:  
@page "/book/form"  
...  
@attribute \[Authorize\(Roles = "Admin"\)\]  
...  
If you have multiple roles, you can set the Roles property with a normal string but with a comma to  
separate the roles – for example, \[Authorize\(Roles = "Admin,Supervisor"\)\].  
Run the project with the API and log in with an admin account. Navigate to /book/form. You will  
see the page normally, but if you log in again with the customer account and navigate to the same  
page, you will see the unauthorized view we saw in Figure 9.6. Implementing authorization and advanced authentication features 221  
Roles are great for access authorization, but that’s not the only way to do it. We have a more flexible  
way to restrict access to the app’s resources\: policies. Policies can be used to get the same result, but  
they allow us to have more control over the requirements we want. With roles, either the user has  
this role or not; it’s simple and straightforward. With policies, we can have more customization; for  
example, we can have an authorization policy that’s based on the age or the country of the user, and  
this is very popular in many apps you use daily.  
So, you can build some policies and give them the specs you are aiming for. For example, you can  
make a policy that is satisfied when the user has a certain claim or doesn’t have another one, or when  
a claim has a certain value.  
The token that our API retrieves has the Country claim, so we will build a policy based on the  
country. For example, our store sells only in the United Kingdom, so we need to ensure that users  
from outside this country won’t be able to buy books or add items to their cart. Or we can restrict a  
new feature for a certain area for testing purposes before releasing it publicly.  
To build a policy, navigate to Program.cs and manipulate the AddAuthorizationCore  
method we called earlier in the Building a custom JWT authentication flow subsection by using the  
overloaded version, which allows us to customize the AuthorizationOptions object and add  
policies based on that, as shown here\:  
...  
builder.Services.AddAuthorizationCore\(options =\>  
\{  
options.AddPolicy\("UK\_Customer", policy =\>  
\{  
policy.RequireClaim\(ClaimTypes.Country, "UK"\);  
\}\);  
\}\);  
...  
The AddPolicy method is used to create a new policy, and it accepts a name and a delegate to configure  
the AuthorizationPolicyBuilder object. For the policy object, we use the RequireClaim  
method, which takes the name of the claim’s type and the allowed value, which is UK in our example.  
ClaimTypes.Country is one of many string constants that represent predefined common claim  
types, and we use the Country claim to check for its value.  
It’s time to use our policy. So far, we have only restricted access to a full page using the \[Authorize\]  
attribute, and we did the same with roles too. With policies, it’s the same thing\:  
\[Authorize\(Policy = "UK\_Customer"\)\]  
For our example, we are not going to use this policy to restrict access to full pages. We will use it to  
prevent customers who do not fulfill the policy from adding items to their cart, which is only a specific  
part of the full UI, and that’s what we will learn how to achieve next. 222  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
The AuthorizeView component  
AuthorizeView is another powerful built-in component in the authentication library. It allows us to  
show or hide part of the UI based on the user’s authentication state. For example, we can show the  
login button if the user is not authenticated but show a greeting message and a logout button if the  
user is authenticated. Another example we will go through is the Add to Cart button. We will hide  
this button and show a message indicating that only UK customers can buy books if the customer  
is not from within the UK. The Add Book form page now doesn’t have a link in the nav bar, and we  
have restricted its access to only admins. We will be using AuthorizeView to show the link in the  
nav bar if the logged user is an admin.  
The component takes two RenderFragment parameters\: one called Authorized, which we can  
use to render content for authorized users, and one called NotAuthorized, with which we can  
render content for unauthorized users. Also, the authorized RenderFragment gives us access to  
the identity and the user object via the context parameter. If you add AuthorizeView with UI  
content directly without wrapping it with \<Authorized\> or \<NotAuthorized\>, it will render  
the content in \<Authorized\> by default.  
With the scenarios we have covered, we can deal with almost any situation you may face in your  
app-building process. We can control content based on whether the user is logged in or not, based  
on a custom policy, or based on a role.  
Let’s see that in action. We will begin with the Login button on the right of the page. We will show  
the button if the user is not logged in, but we will show a message and a Logout button if the user is  
logged in\:  
1\. 2. In the Shared folder, create a new Razor component and call it LoginDisplay. We will  
have this logic in a separate component to not make the Navbar huge and complicated.  
Add the following code to the component\:  
\<AuthorizeView\>  
\<Authorized\>  
@\* Render the content if the user is logged in  
\*@  
\<div class="d-flex align-items-center"\>  
\<p class="my-0"\>Hello @context.User  
.FindFirst\(ClaimTypes.GivenName\)?.Value  
\</p\>  
\<button class="btn btn-danger mx-2"\>  
Logout\</button\>  
\</div\>  
\</Authorized\>  
\<NotAuthorized\>  
@\* Render the content if the user is not Implementing authorization and advanced authentication features 223  
logged in \*@  
\<a class="btn btn-outline-primary"  
href="/authentication/login"\>Login\</a\>  
\</NotAuthorized\>  
\</AuthorizeView\>  
3. In the preceding code, AuthorizeView is very straightforward. In the \<Authorized\>  
parameter tag, we add the greeting message and access the user claims using @context with  
a Logout button. We will write its logic later.  
In NavBar.razor, also in the Shared folder, in the last div, we have a Login button. We  
will replace it with the LoginDisplay component\:  
...  
\<div class="d-flex"\>  
\<LoginDisplay /\>  
\</div\>  
...  
Let’s run the app and see the result in both cases. If you are not logged in, you will see the normal  
Login button, but this time, it will direct you to the Login page. Otherwise, you should see the result  
shown in the following screenshot\:  
Figure 9.8 – Content if the user is logged in  
The next scenario we want to cover is using AuthorizeView to render content based on a specific  
role. We will add a link to the BookForm page in NavBar.razor as a new \<li\> HTML tag below  
the existing links, but it will only appear to admin users. We have two ways to achieve this. The first  
is to use the IsInRole method for the User object within the \<Authorized\> parameter tag,  
as demonstrated here\:  
...  
\<AuthorizeView\>  
\<Authorized\>  
@if \(context.User.IsInRole\("Admin"\)\)  
\{  
\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<NavLink class="nav-link"  
href="/Book/Form"\>Add Book\</NavLink\>  
\</li\>  
\} 224  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
\</Authorized\>  
\</AuthorizeView\>  
...  
Alternatively, we can achieve the same result directly using the AuthorizeView component\:  
\<AuthorizeView Roles="Admin"\>  
\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<NavLink class="nav-link" href="/Book/Form"\>  
Add Book\</NavLink\>  
\</li\>  
\</AuthorizeView\>  
So, which one should you use? Both achieve the same goal. The second one is more readable and  
has less code, but the first one gives you more manipulation power and flexibility. Also, if you want  
to render special content for unauthorized users, you need to add both tags, \<Authorized\>  
and \<NotAuthorized\>.  
You will see the Add Book link at the top when you run the app if you are logged in using an admin  
account. Otherwise, the link will not be there.  
The last thing to talk about for AuthorizeView is rendering content based on a policy. We have  
created the UK\_Customer policy, so let’s apply it to the Add to Cart button within the BookCard  
component in the Shared folder\:  
...  
\<AuthorizeView Policy="UK\_Customer"\>  
\<Authorized\>  
\<button class="main-button"  
@onclick="AddToCart"\>Add to Cart\</button\>  
\</Authorized\>  
\<NotAuthorized\>  
\<p class="text-center"\>Books only available for  
sale in UK for the time being\</p\>  
\</NotAuthorized\>  
\</AuthorizeView\>  
...  
Easy and powerful, right? Let’s test it and make sure it’s working as expected by logging in and using the  
ahmad.mozaffar@masteringblazor.com account. This customer is located in the UK, so we  
should see the button, but because we’re using the admin account, we should see something like this\: Implementing authorization and advanced authentication features 225  
Figure 9.9 – Book card without an Add to Cart button  
That’s all for AuthorizeView. The scenarios we have covered allow you to customize your user  
experience up to the enterprise level. By setting up your roles and the policies correctly, you will be  
able to satisfy any requirement from small use cases up to enterprise-level scenarios.  
CascadingAuthenticationState  
We have seen how to control the UI for either a full page or part of it based on the authentication  
state, but what about the logic of the app? What if we want to retrieve the previously added user’s  
shopping cart items from the API? This action should be taken if the user is logged in only; otherwise,  
it’s not needed.  
Earlier, in the Building a custom JWT authentication flow section, we modified App.razor and  
wrapped all the components with a \<CascadingAuthenticationState\> component. All  
this component does is provide an AuthenticationState object to the child components via  
a cascading parameter.  
If we want to run specific logic only if the user is authenticated in the Index.razor page after the  
component is initialized, all we need to do is follow these steps\:  
1\. 2. Open Index.razor in the Pages/UserPages folder.  
Add a cascading parameter of the Task\<AuthenticationState\> type to the @code section\:  
...  
\[CascadingParameter\]  
public Task\<AuthenticationState\>? AuthenticationState  
\{ get; set; \}  
... 226  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
3. In the OnInitializedAsync life cycle method, you can get the state and the user object  
and write your logic just like this\:  
...  
var authState = await AuthenticationState;  
if \(authState.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated\)  
\{  
// Execute logic if the user is authenticated  
\}  
...  
The same concepts are applicable when it comes to roles or reading the claims and so on, as we learned  
earlier in the chapter.  
Sign-out functionality  
Of course, you don’t want the app to allow users to log in and not allow them to log out again. Our  
authentication uses the token in the local storage to determine the authentication process. If we  
remove that token from the storage and tell AuthenticationStateProvider to evaluate the  
authentication state again, there will be an empty authentication state with no claims or authentication  
scheme, which means no user is logged in.  
We will apply the logout logic to the LoginDisplay.razor component we created in the The  
AuthorizeView component subsection part earlier in this section\:  
1. Inject the ILocalStorageService and AuthenticationStateProvider instances\:  
@using Blazored.LocalStorage;  
@inject ILocalStorageService LocalStorage  
@inject AuthenticationStateProvider  
AuthenticationStateProvider  
...  
2. In the @code section, add the LogoutAsync method. It will remove the token and let  
AuthenticationStateProvider fetch the new state again. It will return an empty  
authentication state and notify the whole app about this change\:  
...  
private async Task LogoutAsync\(\)  
\{  
await  
LocalStorage.RemoveItemAsync\("access\_token"\);  
await AuthenticationStateProvider Implementing authorization and advanced authentication features 227  
.GetAuthenticationStateAsync\(\);  
\}  
...  
3. Assign the LogoutAsync method to the @onclick event of the Logout button in the  
AuthorizedView component\:  
\<button class="btn btn-danger mx-2" @  
onclick="LogoutAsync"\>Logout\</button\>  
That’s it! Run the app and give it a test. Click the Logout button and, if you are logged in with the  
admin account, you will see that the Add Book link in the navbar will disappear. The greeting message  
with the Logout button will disappear too, and the Login button will appear again.  
Auto-redirect to login  
When the user is not logged in and opens the FetchData page, only content that is not authorized will  
be rendered. We defined the content in App.razor within the AuthorizeRouteView component.  
This is one approach. The other way is to redirect the user to the login page automatically. To have  
better control over what the user sees while accessing an authorized page, whether we’re controlling  
the UI or the logic, it’s recommended to create a separate component that renders and does the logic  
we are aiming for and render this component in AuthorizeRouteView.  
Let’s implement auto-redirect to the login page step by step\:  
1\. 2. Create a component called RedirectToLogin in the Shared folder.  
Inject NavigationManager and, in the @code section, override the OnInitialized  
method and navigate the user to the login page\:  
@inject NavigationManager Navigation  
@code \{  
protected override void OnInitialized\(\)  
\{  
Navigation.NavigateTo\("/authentication/login"\);  
\}  
\}  
3. The component is very straightforward. It doesn’t need to render anything. Whenever it’s loaded,  
it will navigate the user to the login page.  
Add the RedirectToLogin component inside the \<NotAuthorized\> tag in  
AuthorizeRouteView within App.razor instead of the text and the login button\:  
...  
\<AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" 228  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
DefaultLayout="@typeof\(UserLayout\)"\>  
\<NotAuthorized\>  
\<RedirectToLogin /\>  
\</NotAuthorized\>  
\</AuthorizeRouteView\>  
...  
By following this method, you have more flexibility over what should happen if a user accesses  
a protected page. This intermediary component can do more than RedirectToLogin, but  
we have demonstrated that as it’s a common flow.  
With that, we have come to the end of exploring Blazor’s authentication capabilities and how to put  
them into practice. However, some or all the API endpoints you are dealing with can be authorized,  
so you need to send the access token in the HTTP request while accessing those endpoints. This is  
what we will learn about in the upcoming section.  
# Accessing authorized API endpoints  
In the API of BooksStore, or any APIs you are working with, either some or all the endpoints will  
be secured and will require an authorized user with the right roles and permissions. In this book,  
we are looking at web APIs from the client’s perspective, so we are not going to explain how the API  
authentication system works internally. The API documentation should tell you how the authentication  
works and what you should do to access the protected endpoints; if you are the developer of the API,  
you should know how it works directly.  
In this chapter, we used JWT authentication, which is the most common form of authentication  
nowadays, even if you are dealing with identity providers such as Microsoft, Google, and Facebook,  
rather than the custom flow that we built; they all work the same. With this authentication scheme  
to access a protected endpoint in the API, all you should do is send the access token that the API  
gave to you in the login process within each HTTP request you are sending for that API. That sounds  
easy, and it is easy actually, and we will see how to do that practically in Blazor WebAssembly next.  
In the flow I just mentioned, whenever we are using HttpClient to send an API request, we can  
grab the token from the local storage, attach it to the header of the HTTP request, and we’re done.  
But that will make us write the same code every time we add a new HTTP request to the API. What  
we will do instead is rely on the HTTP Message Handlers, which we discovered in the Exploring  
IHttpClientFactory and delegating handlers section in Chapter 8.  
An HTTP Message Handler specifically for authorization, every time we send a request to the API,  
automatically gets the token from the storage and puts it in the header of the request. By following  
this approach, we will write this logic only once, and it will apply to every HTTP request being sent,  
as well as the ones you will add later. Accessing authorized API endpoints 229  
For the BooksStore API, so far, we only have the POST request to add a new book that is authorized.  
If an HTTP request is sent without a token, with an invalid token, or with a token but not for an admin  
user, the API will return a 401 status code, which means the request is not authorized.  
If you want to test that flow in Postman, you can get a token using the login endpoint, then copy that  
token and set it in the authorization header value using the Authorization tab, as illustrated in the  
following screenshot\:  
Figure 9.10 – Setting the JWT in the header of the request  
Here, Postman is adding a new header value to the HTTP request with the Authorization key,  
and its value is the word Bearer concatenated with the user token.  
We will build the message handler and, inside it, we will simulate what Postman is doing for the  
HttpRequestMessage object that is being sent to the API\:  
1\. 2. In the root folder, create a new class called AuthorizationMessageHandler.cs.  
Let the class inherit from DelegatingHandler and inject ILocalStorageService  
so we can fetch the token\:  
using Blazored.LocalStorage;  
namespace BooksStore;  
public class AuthorizationMessageHandler \:  
DelegatingHandler  
\{  
private readonly ILocalStorageService  
\_localStorage;  
public AuthorizationMessagingHandler\( 230  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
ILocalStorageService localStorage\)  
\{  
\_localStorage = localStorage;  
\}  
\}  
3. Override the SendAsync method. It checks whether the token is there because the token will  
not be in the local storage if the user is not logged in. After that, attach it to the header of the  
request, as the following code snippet shows\:  
...  
protected override async Task\<HttpResponseMessage\>  
SendAsync\(HttpRequestMessage request,  
CancellationToken cancellationToken\)  
\{  
if \(await  
\_localStorage.ContainKeyAsync\("access\_token"\)\)  
\{  
var token = await \_localStorage  
.GetItemAsync\<string\>\("access\_token"\);  
request.Headers.Authorization = new  
System.Net.Http.Headers  
.AuthenticationHeaderValue\("Bearer",  
token\);  
\}  
return await base.SendAsync\(request,  
cancellationToken\);  
\}  
...  
4\. Register AuthorizationMessageHandler in the DI container and  
attach it to the HttpClient instance we have in Program.cs using the  
AddHttpMessagingHandler method\:  
...  
builder.Services.AddScoped\<AuthorizationMessageHandler\>\(\);  
builder.Services.AddHttpClient\("BooksStore.ServerAPI", client =\>  
client.BaseAddress = new Uri\(builder.Configuration\["ApiUrl"\]\)\)  
.AddHttpMessageHandler\<AuthorizationMessageHandler\>\(\);  
...  
Another task was accomplished, and as usual, we need to make sure that it is working properly. To  
validate the token being sent in every request, we need to monitor the HTTP calls being sent from  
the app using the browser’s Developer Tools. Run the app, open Developer Tools in the browser,  
and navigate to the Network tab. Then, log in to the app while the developer tools are open, and Accessing authorized API endpoints 231  
finally, navigate to the Index page. Because the Index page is sending a request to the API to fetch  
the books, we should see the request in the Network tab, and we should see the token in the header  
of the request too.  
Figure 9.11 – The Bearer token sent in the authorization header of the HTTP request  
When the user is not signed in, you will notice that the same request will be sent but with the  
Authorization header value.  
That’s how you can call an authenticated API endpoint. If this token is valid and satisfies the authorization  
requirements of the API endpoint, you will get the data or execute the action successfully. Otherwise,  
the API will send you a response with a status code of 401.  
We have done a lot in this chapter up to this point, but Blazor still has a lot to offer. In the next  
section, we are going to talk about what Blazor still provides out of the box for other scenarios, such as  
authentication with Microsoft Azure AD or AD B2C, which is part of the Microsoft Identity Platform. 232  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
# Integrating with the Microsoft Identity Platform  
We have taken advantage of many features the Blazor authentication library provides. We have  
implemented all those features step by step and from scratch. Microsoft has some of the best identity  
solutions on the market, though\: Azure AD and AD B2C. What’s great about it is that Microsoft  
also provides a library for all possible clients \(JavaScript frameworks, Xamarin, .NET MAUI, native  
Windows frameworks, and, of course, Blazor\). The client library Microsoft provides is called the  
Microsoft Authentication Library \(MSAL\). When it comes to Blazor WebAssembly, MSAL is built  
on top of the Blazor authentication library and already provides much of what we have done out of  
the box. What’s even better is that .NET provides a couple of project templates that allow you to create  
the Blazor app with authentication and MSAL set up for you, so you just build components and the  
business logic because everything else is ready.  
In this section, we won’t write code or explain AD in depth because that would require a whole other  
chapter or even a full book, but we will introduce it in a nutshell so that you’ll know whether it suits  
your needs or not. Luckily, the Microsoft docs have some very concise information on the subject,  
but I will provide some explanation of the process overall and when it’s needed.  
What is Azure AD?  
Briefly, Azure AD is a cloud-based identity provider developed and maintained by Microsoft. Recently,  
Microsoft rebranded its identity platform as Microsoft Entra, so Azure AD is part of the Entra  
platform. Azure AD provides full access management features for organizations. Many companies  
use Microsoft 365 products, and you can access those products using what’s called a Microsoft work  
or school account, which is the same as an Azure AD user account. Personal Microsoft accounts,  
such as the one you use for Outlook or Xbox, are available on Azure AD too. When using Azure AD  
for your solution, your app cannot register users. It will just allow them to log in using their existing  
Microsoft personal or work and school account, depending on your scenario.  
What is Azure AD B2C?  
Azure AD B2C is another identity and access management service from Microsoft, but this one differs  
a lot from the standard Azure AD offering. Azure AD B2C is ideal for software solutions that have  
users whom you want to have full control over and whom you want to allow to create accounts, log  
in, integrate with many social providers, edit profiles, and so much more. Azure AD B2C is capable  
of handling millions of users at scale and the billions of daily authentications made by these users. It  
enables unlimited customization for the user fields, the design and branding of the login and register  
pages, token claims, and more.  
The difference between Azure AD and Azure AD B2C is that Azure AD users and accounts are  
Microsoft accounts, but you can integrate your app with them, while with Azure AD B2C, Microsoft  
provides you with all the identity infrastructure and tools while you own the users, customize the  
login and register flows, and customize the branding. As the name indicates, B2C means there is a Integrating with the Microsoft Identity Platform 233  
business, such as the BooksStore library in our example, and there are users for it, while in Azure  
AD, there are Microsoft accounts and you integrate with them.  
Another common service that many developers know that is similar to B2C is Auth0. You can learn  
more about it at https\://auth0.com.  
When should I use Azure AD, Azure AD B2C, or a custom flow?  
The answer varies depending on the scenario. If you are the full owner of the solution or are the  
decision-maker, then the following tips will help, but if you are only a frontend developer on the  
system, the backend team and the architects will be better placed to decide what to do.  
In some scenarios, such as legacy solutions, you don’t have a choice. The app is there, and a database  
full of millions of users has been up and running for years. That means you need to build a custom  
authentication flow unless the team wants to migrate to a service such as Azure AD B2C.  
If your app is built for organizations that use Microsoft 365 for a single organization or even for what  
is known as a multi-tenant app, integrating with Azure AD is the best option because, with MSAL,  
you can get an API and Blazor WebAssembly with authentication set up without writing any code.  
Another situation in which you should use Azure AD is when your app targets Microsoft service APIs  
such as Microsoft Graph API, for instance. In this situation, you must use Azure AD.  
The most common scenario is that you are building Software as a Service \(SaaS\)\: either software to be  
built by you for public users, or software for a single organization that has users. Azure AD B2C is the  
best option here. For example, let’s say you are building an e-commerce platform, a multiplayer game,  
or a calendar app. I highly recommend going with B2C not only for its high security or scalability,  
which are huge benefits, but also because of MSAL and the Blazor WebAssembly project templates,  
which create the project for you with all the authentication needed, even with an API.  
Note  
To build a new Blazor WebAssembly app secured with Azure AD B2C, you can refer to the  
steps at https\://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/  
security/webassembly/standalone-with-azure-active-directory-

For apps with the normal Azure AD, visit https\://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/  
aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/standalone-with-azure-  
active-directory?view=aspnetcore-7.0.  
We discussed a lot while building our custom flow, but that was intentional. Now, even if you have  
created a Blazor WebAssembly project with MSAL, everything is ready. With the knowledge gleaned  
from this chapter, you should know exactly what’s happening under the hood and be able to easily  
manage special authentication scenarios, and that was the main goal of this chapter. 234  
Authenticatiwng and Authorizing Users in Blazor  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we saw how to get the best out of Blazor WebAssembly when it comes to authentication,  
from making the API call and getting the token to setting up the authentication infrastructure, such as  
the authentication state provider and the authentication components. After that, we covered as many  
scenarios as possible that you may face in your real-world applications, such as role-based authorization  
and custom policies, and how to integrate them with built-in authentication components to secure  
and control the UI and the logic of the app based on the user identity.  
We ended the chapter with a brief introduction to the Microsoft Identity Platform with Azure AD  
and Azure AD B2C, in addition to MSAL and what it provides out of the box when it comes to  
Blazor WebAssembly.  
After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Understand the client-side authentication flow for single-page applications  
Build a powerful authentication mechanism for your Blazor WebAssembly app  
Set up role-based authorization or a custom authorization flow using authorization policies  
Control the UI components, pages, and logic based on user identity  
Be aware of the Microsoft identity systems and when to choose them  
When we have users in our system, and we can communicate with our API, it’s a good time to increase  
the reliability of our project by having a strong error-handling mechanism, which we’ll cover in the  
next chapter. The user won’t see our app crash, and we will learn how to handle everything gracefully.

# Handling Errors in Blazor  
# WebAssembly  
You are working hard on the client side, you have built an amazing app that does everything perfectly,  
the UI is great, your app is fetching and sending data from and to the API correctly, and everyone  
is happy. But what if the API, for some reason, is taking too long to process requests, so your app  
loads for around 30 seconds, then a yellow bar appears at the bottom, indicating that an unhandled  
exception occurred? That’s an experience that neither the user nor the developer would like to have.  
Errors and exceptions can occur for many reasons and in many parts of an app. The goal of this  
chapter is to learn the techniques to handle them properly and give users a better experience. We  
will start by explaining why error handling matters and then how to manage the errors that could  
arise from communication with the API. Then, we will build a global error handler, where all errors  
will be handled and processed properly. Finally, we will discuss the ErrorBoundary component  
introduced in .NET 6.0 and see how it can be used for error handling.  
The main topics that this chapter will address are as follows\:  
•  
Understanding error handling  
•  
•  
•  
Managing API errors  
Implementing global error handlers  
Utilizing the ErrorBoundary component  
# Technical requirements

Make sure to have the API solution up and running beside the Blazor one. 236  
Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly  
# Understanding error handling  
Failures can show up in many parts of the app, either due to some lack of handling for the business  
logic or due to external circumstances such as the API being unreachable. The process of reacting to  
those errors gracefully without letting them crash the app is what’s called error handling.  
Errors don’t always imply bad code or incorrect logic; these are just some of the causes of errors.  
Sometimes, the business logic of the app forces an error to be shown if the user is violating the rules.  
Other errors can be caused by external circumstances, such as the API being down. Writing good  
code can prevent programming errors. For example, if you are accessing a null object, that will throw  
a NullReferenceException, but this exception is avoidable with better code management.  
Let’s take an example of a feature that imports data into the system. The user can upload a file, and  
the logic of the feature forces this file to be either an Excel sheet or a CSV file. From a programming  
perspective, there is nothing wrong with loading any file, but from a logic point of view, only Excel or  
CSV files are allowed. So, the app shouldn’t allow the user to pick an image, for instance; at the same  
time, the app shouldn’t crash. If the user managed to load an improper file, the app simply shouldn’t  
proceed with processing it and should tell the user, with a clear message, that only Excel and CSV  
files are allowed.  
Handling errors correctly is always associated with the robustness of the system. Even if you build an  
app that’s full of amazing features but the logic is prone to failure, your users won’t be happy, and neither  
will you. Errors and exceptions are a source of stress for the developers in the production environment.  
Following the standards and maintaining proper error processing can boost your confidence in what  
you have developed, make it easier for you to detect errors, and keep your users happy.  
Now the question is\: what measures should we follow to keep our app healthy and efficient to avoid  
or handle errors?  
Well, there are no magic solutions or components to prevent errors in the app, but there are some  
practices that you can follow to help reduce errors or make your app react better to them when they occur\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Following best coding practices  
Giving exception scenarios in your logic a lot of attention  
Taking compiler errors seriously  
Going over open source code can dramatically increase your code efficiency  
Writing unit tests, as we will learn in Chapter 13, can detect errors in the development stage  
Having proper validation for your inputs  
Having a deep understanding of the features rules and business logic can help you identify  
scenarios early that could lead to potential errors later Understanding error handling 237  
As I have mentioned, following the best practices will reduce the number of errors but won’t prevent  
them, so we need a good mechanism to react to those errors, and that’s what we will be doing in the  
next three sections.  
Back in our BooksStore project, right now, the app does some cool stuff and has a good authentication  
system, as well as an advanced form for adding books, but it’s so easy to break it. We can easily see  
how\: just run the app without running the API project. That will simulate the API’s unavailability.  
You will notice immediately the light yellow bar at the bottom of the screen that indicates that an  
exception has occurred.  
Figure 11.1 – Blazor error bar for unhandled exceptions  
We need our users to have the best experience, and even when such an incident occurs, the app should  
indicate what went wrong in a better way. So, the plan we will follow to achieve that is as follows\:  
•  
Understand the API endpoints for failure responses  
•  
Handle API scenarios such as network failures, internal server errors when it returns the 500  
status code, and unauthorized requests scenarios  
•  
Build a global error handler that centralizes logging and exception handling  
•  
Use the ErrorBoundary component to show a specific error message when an exception  
happens while rendering a component  
In the next section, we will start with the points related to the API; let’s get into it. 238  
Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly  
# Managing API errors  
APIs are the main source of headaches in the project. API calls happen through the network and  
the potential for failure always exists. The API could respond differently based on the status of the  
response, and other scenarios could occur, such as the server being down, unhandled exceptions  
occurring while processing the request, or authentication and authorization errors.  
For all these reasons, it’s very important to handle API requests carefully. The starting point is to  
understand at each point what could go wrong and what the appropriate response is in each case. If  
you are the developer of the API, things are easier, but if you are not, the documentation should be  
the main source of truth.  
The BooksStore API has the Swagger page that we used in previous chapters to understand the  
input and output of some API endpoints. We noticed that the endpoints either succeed or retrieve the  
400 Bad Request status code, which means something went wrong on the client side. Errors with  
400 responses don’t mean programmatical errors. For example, if you pass the wrong username and  
password to the login endpoint, the API will return a 400 status response with an error object  
indicating that the credentials are invalid. The app should handle these scenarios properly and reflect  
what happens to the user, in contrast to other errors, such as network failures, where you should just  
let the user know that something went wrong while connecting to the server.  
For the BooksStore API, if there is an error, all the endpoints return the same object, an object  
containing a message, and an array of errors.  
There is no single best approach to handling this task. Some developers prefer to return a generic C\#  
object called Result\<TSuccess, TFailed\>, for example. The object contains both properties  
for the objects in the success response and the failure response and then uses the Result object to  
control how the app reacts to each status. Another solution, which is the one we will use, is throwing  
a custom exception that contains the error object coming from the API; then, if this exception occurs  
in the logic of the component, we show an appropriate message or react accordingly.  
The procedure we will follow relates to responses with a 400 status code. We will throw a custom  
exception called ApiResponseException. This exception will hold the error object coming from  
the API but doesn’t imply something went wrong programmatically; it means the API is clarifying what  
went wrong with the request, so we should show the message to the user as it was retrieved from the  
API. For other response types, such as 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, or 500 Internal  
server error, we will throw an exception for the time being telling the user that something is  
wrong and to please try again later. Managing API errors 239  
Note  
Many APIs use error codes in the response object; so, instead of returning a message that  
says Invalid username or password, it returns an error code with the INVALID\_  
CREDENTIALS value. Handling error codes is great and makes it easier to build the error  
messages in the client by mapping each error code to a message, which could be a localized  
message or even an action to take for a specific error code.  
Because this book is looking at the API from the client’s perspective only, we will not go into the  
solutions for keeping your API available and robust against failures. Also, you may not be using your  
own API; your app may rely on third-party APIs. So, anything can happen, and our client app should  
react correctly in any possible scenario.  
So, let’s approach the solution step by step\:  
1\. 2. Create a new folder in the project called Exceptions, and inside it, create a new class  
called ApiResponeException.cs.  
The class must inherit from the Exception class and should have a property of  
ApiErrorResponse, the model we created in Chapter 9 for the failure cases, and it should  
pass the message to the constructor of the base class, as shown here\:  
using BooksStore.Models;  
namespace BooksStore.Exceptions;  
public class ApiResponseException \: Exception  
\{  
public ApiErrorResponse ErrorDetails \{ get; set; \}  
public ApiResponseException\(ApiErrorResponse errorDetails\) \:  
base\(errorDetails.Message\)  
\{  
ErrorDetails = errorDetails;  
\}  
\}  
3. If the API doesn’t return a unique object type for error cases, you may consider using the  
generic ApiResponseException\<TError\>, where TError is the type of error for  
each specific call.  
Now, we can throw this exception and handle other errors for each API request. So far in  
our system, we have made three API calls\: one to add a new book, another one to retrieve  
the books, and the last one to fetch the access token. Let’s implement this handling for the  
login request within AuthenticationService.cs in the Services folder. Inside the  
LoginUserAsync method, we only handle success cases and treat everything else the same  
way. We will modify it to be as follows\:  
using BooksStore.Exceptions;  
... 240  
Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly  
var response = await \_httpClient.  
PostAsJsonAsync\("authentication/login", requestModel\);  
if \(response.IsSuccessStatusCode\)  
\{  
return await response.Content.  
ReadFromJsonAsync\<LoginResponse\>\(\);  
\}  
else if \(response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.  
BadRequest\)  
\{  
// Handle the bad request as the API doc says  
var error = await response.Content.  
ReadFromJsonAsync\<ApiErrorResponse\>\(\);  
throw new ApiResponseException\(error\);  
\}  
else  
\{  
// Throw exception for other failure responses  
throw new Exception\("Opps! Something went wrong"\);  
\}  
...  
You can be very detailed and handle each possible response code in a special way, and you can  
use the ILogger service to log errors other than 400 Bad Request\:  
else  
\{  
var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync\(\);  
\_logger.LogError\(\$"Failed to log the user in. Status code \{response.StatusCode\}", content\);  
// Throw exception for other failure responses  
throw new Exception\("Opps! Something went wrong"\);  
\}  
4\. The API docs will help you understand what to expect in case of failures, or if you are already  
the developer, then you know the exact behavior in the failed scenarios. You can apply the same  
concept we used for all other API calls.  
Now, we need to handle the exceptions that could arise from the API call in the Login  
component. Open Login.razor within the Pages/Authentication folder and add  
a string variable called \_errorMessage. This variable will be rendered in the UI below the  
Login button, but only if it’s not empty\:  
...  
\<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"\>Login\</button\>  
@if \(!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace\(\_errorMessage\)\)  
\{  
\<div class="alert alert-danger my-2"\> Managing API errors 241  
@\_errorMessage  
\</div\>  
\}  
\</EditForm\>  
\</div\>  
\</div\>  
@code \{  
...  
private string \_errorMessage = string.Empty;  
...  
5. In the SubmitLoginFormAsync method, we already have a try/catch block wrapping  
the call, but we will add another catch to handle ApiResponseException if it occurs.  
For this exception, we need the user to see what went wrong, such as invalid credentials. So,  
we will populate \_errorMessage with an exception message. Also, when the user clicks  
Login, we will clear \_errorMessage at the beginning of the submit form logic\:  
private async Task SubmitLoginFormAsync\(\)  
\{  
\_errorMessage = string.Empty;  
try  
\{  
...  
\}  
catch \(ApiResponseException ex\)  
\{  
\_errorMessage = ex.Message;  
\}  
catch \(Exception ex\)  
\{  
// TODO\: Log the error in Chapter 11  
Console.WriteLine\(ex.Message\);  
\}  
\}  
That’s it for now for the general exception handling. We will be visiting this again in the next section  
after building the global error handler for those cases.  
To test what we have done, run the project alongside the API. The login endpoint in the API will  
return 400 Bad Request if you supply an invalid username and password. So, try to log in with  
random values and you should see the following\: 242  
Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly  
Figure 11.2 – Login with error handling  
That’s cool, we resolved one flow. This flow is important because it’s part of the business logic and is  
quite common. It’s very important to handle 400 errors carefully. The same approach applied here  
must be applied to every API endpoint you call based on its specification.  
Next, we will get into the general exceptions and the rare cases. We have the function to catch general  
exceptions; they are not processed right now. The message is just written in the console. In the next  
section, we will develop a general approach to handling all such errors from a single place.  
# Implementing global error handlers  
Having a global error handler gives you a centralized place to handle all errors the same way. This  
will also allow centralized logging. Errors such as API request timeouts, internal server errors, or any  
other unexpected scenarios will be handled here. Handling them will consist of showing a readable  
message to the user, indicating that something went wrong and logging the error.  
We will use cascading parameters to create an error handler component for our app. This component  
will be placed in the App.razor file and will wrap all the other app components. It will have a method  
that takes an exception as a parameter and processes it accordingly. By using a cascading parameter,  
we can provide the error handler component as an object for all the descendant components in our  
app. With that, any component can have access to the handler instance and will be able to call the  
handle method exception. Implementing global error handlers 243  
Let’s implement the flow and use it within the Login component\:  
1\. 2. In the Shared folder, create a new component called ErrorHandler.razor.  
When an exception happens, we need to show the user a popup or message somehow. A  
common UI scenario is showing what’s known as a snackbar in the top right for a couple of  
seconds, then it fades out. It’s all up to your UI design and user experience. We will mention  
some UI frameworks in Chapter 15, What’s Next?. For now, to keep things on point, we will  
use the default browser alert dialog by invoking the JavaScript alert method. To do that, we  
inject the IJSRuntime service and create a method called ShowAlertAsync in the code  
section, as shown here\:  
@inject IJSRuntime JS  
@code \{  
private Task ShowAlertAsync\(string message\)  
\{  
await JS.InvokeVoidAsync\("alert", message\);  
\}  
\}  
3. The component won’t have any UI markup, so it will just render the child components via a  
RenderFragment and wrap it with the \<CascadingValue\> we learned about in the  
Passing data between components section of Chapter 2\:  
...  
\<CascadingValue Value="this" IsFixed="true"\>  
@ChildContent  
\</CascadingValue\>  
@code \{  
\[Parameter\]  
public RenderFragment ChildContent \{ get; set; \}  
...  
\}  
4. Inject the ILogger service and write the method that will process the exceptions. We will  
call it HandleExceptionAsync. The method will show a message based on the type of  
exception. We can use the C\# 7.0 patterns feature in the switch statement so we can process  
the exception object based on its type. This way, we will be able to process the exceptions more  
specifically and show relevant messages\:  
@inject ILogger\<ErrorHandler\> Logger  
...  
public async Task HandleExceptionAsync\(Exception ex\)  
\{ 244  
Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly  
Logger.LogError\(ex, ex.Message\);  
switch \(ex\)  
\{  
// TODO\: Handle more specific exception  
case HttpRequestException \_\:  
await ShowAlertAsync\("Failed to connect to the server."\);  
break;  
default\:  
await ShowAlertAsync\("Something went wrong!"\);  
break;  
\}  
\}  
...  
5. The method is simple\: it logs the error to the console window of the browser and checks the  
type of the exception. If it’s an HttpRequestException type, we show the user an error  
related to the API connection. If it’s the base Exception type, we just show that something  
went wrong. You can add more special handling for different types of exceptions in the same  
way as we did for HttpRequestException.  
Before we can use ErrorHandler, we need to add it to App.razor so it wraps all the app  
components to provide them with its cascading value\:  
...  
\<ErrorHandler\>  
\<CascadingAuthenticationState\>  
...  
\</CascadingAuthenticationState\>  
\</ErrorHandler\>  
6. Now, we can use our error handler. In the Login page component within the Pages/  
Authentication folder, add an ErrorHandler cascading parameter and call  
it ErrorHandler\:  
...  
@code \{  
\[CascadingParameter\]  
public ErrorHandler ErrorHandler \{ get; set; \}  
...  
\}  
7. In SubmitLoginFormAsync within the second catch for the base Exception type,  
remove the Console.WriteLine call, execute the HandleExceptionAsync method  
from ErrorHandler, and pass the ex exception object as an argument\:  
...  
catch \(Exception ex\) Implementing global error handlers 245  
\{  
await ErrorHandler.HandleExceptionAsync\(ex\);  
\}  
...  
This can be applied to every method that could fail. In the project folder cloned from the  
GitHub repo of the project, you will find the same technique applied to all components that  
use the API calls.  
Note  
The ILogger service will log any messages and errors to the console window of the browser.  
So, in a production environment, if an error occurs on a user’s device, you won’t know without  
accessing the user’s browser logs. To send the logs to your server, consider using the popular  
logging package Serilog and setting it up to sink the logs to your API, as explained at https\://  
nblumhardt.com/2019/11/serilog-blazor/.  
To make sure ErrorHandler is working as expected, run the project without running the API and  
try to log in. After a second, an alert will appear indicating that the app is not able to connect to the  
server because the HttpClient instance throws a HttpRequestException, as the following  
screenshot shows\:  
Figure 11.3 – ErrorHandler displaying an error alert 246  
Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly  
If you communicate with an online API and you don’t have control over its availability, you can  
simulate network issues in your app using Developer Tools in your browser. You can set the network  
throttling mode to Offline. The following screenshot is taken from the Edge browser, but the same  
feature is available in Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers\:  
Figure 11.4 – Network throttling simulation in browser set to Offline  
The ErrorHandler component solves critical issues and centralizes the important logic of our  
app. Next in this chapter, we will discuss the ErrorBoundary component, what it resolves, and  
when to use it.  
# Utilizing the ErrorBoundary component  
In .NET 6.0, Blazor got a new component called ErrorBoundary. This component is very  
simple, easy to use, and powerful at the same time. The ErrorBoundary component handles any  
exceptions that occur during the rendering of a child component and displays a custom UI in place  
of the faulty component.  
The ErrorBoundary component accepts two RenderFragement parameters\: one called  
ChildContent, which represents the UI of the child components when no errors occur, and another  
called ErrorContent, which represents the content when an error occurs. Utilizing the ErrorBoundary component 247  
For example, when you use Twitter with a poor internet connection, you may see that the tweet details  
load successfully, but the replies below the tweet display an error message such as Failed to load the  
replies with a Retry button. This experience can be achieved with the ErrorBoundary component,  
but you need to keep in mind that the exception you need to handle with the ErrorBoundary  
error UI must not be handled inside the child component.  
Let’s see via an example how ErrorBoundary works. To demonstrate it, we will make an artificial  
exception with the Counter page. When the currentCount variable value becomes larger than 5,  
we will throw an exception, as shown here, in Counter.razor in the Pages folder\:  
...  
private void IncrementCount\(\)  
\{  
currentCount++;  
if \(currentCount \> 5\)  
throw new Exception\("Counter value must not exceed the value of  
5"\);  
...  
\}  
...  
The Counter page is rendered within UserLayout, so we will place ErrorBoundary around  
the @Body property in the markup. So, open UserLayout.razor in the Shared folder. Add  
ErrorBoundary, as shown in the following code snippet\:  
...  
\<main class="px-5 py-4"\>  
\<ErrorBoundary\>  
\<ChildContent\>  
@Body  
\</ChildContent\>  
\<ErrorContent\>  
\<h3\>Counter must not exceed the value 5\</h3\>  
\</ErrorContent\>  
\</ErrorBoundary\>  
\</main\>  
...  
Inside the component’s \<ChildContent\>, we placed @Body to be rendered when everything is  
fine, and within the \<ErrorContent\> we put an \<h3\> with an error message.  
Run the project, and you will see the Index page as normal, but if you navigate to the Counter page  
and click the Increment Count button six times, you will directly see an error, as shown in the  
following screenshot\: 248  
Handling Errors in Blazor WebAssembly  
Figure 11.5 – ErrorBoundary rendering the error content  
This little demo shows how useful ErrorBoundary is for scenarios such as the aforementioned  
Twitter example. Also, this demo explains why you should avoid using ErrorBoundary on a  
high-level scope, such as the layout, because if any exceptions happen in any component within any  
page, you will see the Counter must not exceed the value 5 error. To get the best out  
of ErrorBoundary, you need to scope it for a specific component so it can render an appropriate  
and predictable error UI.  
The exception details can be accessed within the ErrorContent tag via the @context variable if  
you want to use some data from the exception object properties in the rendered UI.  
The ErrorBoundary component object has a method called Recover. This method resets the  
state of the ErrorBoundary component to a non-error state. To see how the Recover method  
works, add an ErrorBoundary variable to the @code section with UserLayout, and add a button  
below the \<h3\> error message that calls the Recover method. To populate the \_errorBoundry  
variable with the component instance, assign it to the @ref directive as follows\:  
\<ErrorBoundary @ref="\_errorBoundry"\>  
...  
\<ErrorContent\>  
\<h3\>Counter must not exceed the value 5\</h3\>  
\<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="\(\) =\> \_errorBoundry.  
Recover\(\)"\>Reload\</button\>  
\</ErrorContent\>  
\</ErrorBoundary\>  
@code  
\{  
Private ErrorBoundary \_errorBoundary;  
\}  
If you test the same scenario again, when the error UI renders, you can click the Reload button, and  
the Counter page will appear again.  
Overall, ErrorBoundary is a useful component when it’s used correctly and in the right place.  
It’s not very common to use it all over the place, but it can be very beneficial in some cases and helps  
with the user experience of the app. Summary 249  
So, at the end of this chapter, it’s good to mention again that error handling doesn’t have a magical  
standardized solution that resolves everything. Handling your APIs properly, having a good global  
error handler, and following the best practices while doing everything in the app can keep your app  
highly efficient and provide a satisfying experience for the end users.

# Giving Your App a Speed Boost  
Software that is fully functional is not always ready enough to ship. The app must open, let the user  
navigate between the pages, and update the data in the UI quickly enough to satisfy the user’s expectations.  
Blazor WebAssembly provides a set of features for optimizing the performance of the app, in addition  
to some tips that you can follow in the development phase that will increase the speed of your app  
significantly. This chapter covers some complex and specialized topics that are useful for creating apps  
where high performance and efficiency are the key. You may not encounter these situations often,  
but they are important to learn about so you are fully equipped and ready to handle any challenge  
that comes your way.  
We will start this chapter by introducing the Virtualize component, in addition to some guidelines  
to help increase the efficiency of your Blazor components, especially when working on large-scale  
and data-intensive applications. We will also learn how to control and optimize the rendering process  
using the ShouldRender method, which can significantly improve app performance. Lastly, we  
will talk about Blazor WebAssembly’s lazy loading feature, which reduces the initial size of the app  
and speeds up the load time.  
This chapter will cover the following points\:

Giving Your App a Speed Boost  
Make sure to have the API solution up and running beside the Blazor app.  
# Increasing components’ efficiency  
The first thing to do is to improve the speed of the component rendering process. Because, in Blazor  
WebAssembly, the rendering process happens fully in the browser, controlling the process of rendering  
can increase the overall speed of the app, especially in large, rich, and complicated UIs.  
We will start this section by learning about the out-of-the-box Virtualize component. Then, we  
will learn some tips to keep in mind while developing Blazor components to maximize their efficiency.  
Virtualize component  
If you have a UI that renders a table with a large number of rows or a collection of UI components  
through a loop, the component will be slow and laggy because of the huge number of UI elements,  
especially while scrolling. One way to see this problem in action is to look at a chat or social media app.  
Imagine if the app loaded all 5,000 messages in a chatroom, or displayed all the posts in a newsfeed  
at once. That would create thousands of components in the UI, which would slow down the page and  
make it hard to use.  
The Virtualize component introduced in Blazor in .NET 6.0 optimizes the rendering process  
for large lists of elements by only rendering the ones that are visible in the screen viewport. As the  
user scrolls, the Virtualize component dynamically updates the rendered elements based on the  
current viewport, removing the ones that are out of view. This way, the component and scrolling are  
efficient and smooth regardless of the number of elements in the UI.  
The usage of the Virtualize component is straightforward; the following code snippet shows how  
to render the rows of a customer list that contain 10,000 objects the normal way\:  
\<table class="table"\>  
\<thead\>  
\<tr\>  
\<th\>First Name\</th\>  
\<th\>Last Name\</th\>  
\<th\>Email\</th\>  
\</tr\>  
\</thead\>  
\<tbody\>  
@foreach \(var customer in \_customers\)  
\{  
\<tr\>  
\<td\>@customer.FirstName\</td\>  
\<td\>@customer.LastName\</td\>  
\<td\>@customer.Email\</td\> Increasing components’ efficiency 255  
\</tr\>  
\}  
\</tbody\>  
\</table\>  
The preceding code will result in rendering all the rows in the UI, which makes the component laggy.  
To use the Virtualize component, all you need to do is to replace the foreach loop with the  
Virtualize component\:  
...  
\<Virtualize Items="\_customers"\>  
\<tr\>  
\<td\>@context.FirstName\</td\>  
\<td\>@context.LastName\</td\>  
\<td\>@context.Email\</td\>  
\</tr\>  
\</Virtualize\>  
...  
The preceding code shows that the Virtualize component will iterate internally over the list items  
and render them in a performant fashion. At first, from a user perspective, it will be the same\: a table  
of all the customer records. However, the difference will be clear when the user starts to scroll through  
the data; it will be smooth and efficient.  
The Virtualize component takes four important parameters that provide more customization  
and performance gains\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
ItemSize\: You can use this parameter to set the height of each item; this will increase the  
performance of the Virtualize component even more as the component won’t need to do  
any calculations to know when to render the items near the viewport.  
OverscanCount\: This property specifies how many items to render in advance when the user  
is near the edge of the visible area. This way, more items are ready to be shown when the user  
scrolls further. The main benefit of this property is that it reduces the flashing effect when  
scrolling fast, as the items are already rendered before the user sees them.  
ItemsProvider\: This is a delegate that the Virtualize component triggers to fetch more items  
when the user scrolls; in most cases, this can be a method that fetches the data from an API.  
Placeholder\: For items that are being fetched from the data source provided in the  
ItemsProvider parameter, Placeholder specifies a template to render in the meantime,  
until the item is fetched. This approach is common in modern apps such as social media  
platforms, within which, while scrolling down, more posts are fetched and you see an empty  
box fading in and out to let you know that the app is retrieving more content. 256  
Giving Your App a Speed Boost  
Structuring components for performance  
It’s quite tricky to manage the speed and the memory allocation of the code, and it requires some  
advanced skills to get it right. When it comes to the Blazor UI components, there are sets of practices  
and patterns that you can keep in mind while developing them.  
It’s good to know that each component is a fully independent object by itself, and it gets rendered  
in isolation from its parent and child components. Based on a test managed by the ASP.NET  
Core team \(https\://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/  
performance?view=aspnetcore-7.0\#avoid-thousands-of-component-instances\),  
an average component that receives three parameters takes around 0.06 ms to render. The amount  
of time taken to render the component is tiny, but for complicated UIs that contain huge numbers of  
components to render, poor performance may appear.  
Here are three tips that can improve the performance of components in UIs that contain hundreds  
and thousands of components to render\:  
•  
Placing inline child components in their parent\: Generally, it’s a good practice to have isolated  
components for code readability and maintenance. However, this may not be the best option  
for scenarios where performance is critical. For example, if you have a page that displays your  
store’s orders in the last month as cards, and there are 1,500 orders in the UI, you don’t need  
to create a separate component for the order card and render it inside a loop. Instead, you can  
have the card UI directly in the parent component. This can be translated into code as follows\:  
/\* Instead of having it as a component \*/  
@foreach \(var order in \_orders\)  
\{  
\<OrderCard OrderDetails="order" /\>  
\}  
/\* Consider having the OrderCard UI elements directly  
inside the foreach loop \*/  
@foreach \(var order in \_orders\)  
\{  
\<div class="card"\>  
\<h3\>Number\: @order.Number\</h3\>  
\<p\>Total\: \>  
\</div\>  
\}  
The preceding code will save around 1,500 component rendering operations and instances in  
our scenario. •  
•  
Increasing components’ efficiency 257  
Avoiding many parameters when possible\: If the component needs to be nested, and nesting it  
directly in the parent component is not possible, avoid having flat parameters for each property.  
Every parameter received by a component is added to the total time the rendering operation  
takes. Combining parameters within a single object is going to help reduce the rendering time  
when thousands of component instances are being rendered.  
The following code snippet shows an example of a customer card component that receives  
parameters that can be combined in a single object\:  
\<h3\>@DisplayName\</h3\>  
@\* Render more properties \*@  
...  
@code \{  
\[Parameter\]  
public int Id \{ get; set; \}  
\[Parameter\]  
public string DisplayName \{ get; set; \}  
/\* More Customer properties \*/  
\}  
Instead, you can combine the customer properties inside a class\:  
\<h3\>@Customer.DisplayName\</h3\>  
@\* Render more properties \*@  
...  
@code \{  
\[Parameter\]  
public CustomerDetails Customer \{ get; set; \}  
\}  
With all the simplicity of the preceding example, when rendering thousands of instances, each  
added parameter can add a massive amount of time to the overall rendering process.  
Using fixed cascading parameters\: In the Moving data between components section in Chapter 2,  
Components in Blazor, we learned about cascading values and cascading parameters. By default,  
the IsFixed property is false for each cascading value, which means every recipient of the  
cascading value will have a subscription to track the changes to that value. When IsFixed is  
set to true, the recipients will receive the initial value of the cascading value but won’t have  
a subscription to track future updates of it. Consider setting IsFixed to false whenever  
possible, as this will improve the performance, especially when the cascading value is received  
by huge numbers of recipients. 258  
Giving Your App a Speed Boost  
Optimizing the JavaScript calls  
JavaScript interop from Blazor can also be a bit costly because JavaScript communication happens  
asynchronously by default. This is in addition to the JSON serialization and deserialization operations  
involved when passing parameters or returning function results between C\# and JavaScript.  
To avoid a bit of additional overhead when using JavaScript with your Blazor app, consider making  
JavaScript calls synchronously whenever possible. Like the example we gave in the Turning an existing  
JS package into a reusable Blazor component section in Chapter 6, Consuming JavaScript in Blazor, if you  
are using a service such as Google Analytics in your project, JavaScript calls to communicate with the  
Google Analytics SDK can be made synchronously without the need to wait until the call is finished.  
Another optimization tip is to avoid repetitive JavaScript calls or calls within loops whenever possible.  
For instance, your app supports exporting invoices as PDFs, and there is a JavaScript function that  
exports an invoice object into a PDF on the client side that looks like this\:  
function exportInvoiceAsPdf\(invoice\) \{  
// Logic to export the invoice as PDF  
\}  
And there’s a Blazor component that exports all the invoices in the table as PDFs\:  
foreach\(var invoice in \_invoices\)  
\{  
await JS.InvokeVoidAsync\("exportInvoiceAsPdf",  
invoice\);  
\}  
Instead, consider creating a new JavaScript method that accepts an array of invoices, iterates over the  
invoices, and calls exportInvoiceAsPdf\:  
function exportInvoicesCollectionAsPdf\(invoices\) \{  
invoices.forEach\(invoice =\> \{  
exportInvoiceAsPdf\(invoice\);  
\}\);  
\}  
Now, in C\#, you can make one JavaScript call instead of multiple asynchronous calls. We can also  
make it synchronously if the C\# logic is not dependent on the result of this call\:  
JS.InvokeVoidAsync\("exportInvoicesCollectionAsPdf ", invoices\);  
This little change can have a big impact on the performance of the export invoices feature. Rendering optimization with ShouldRender 259  
Using System.Text.Json over other JSON packages  
Either while consuming web APIs or storing objects in the browser storage, JSON is widely used in  
your Blazor WebAssembly apps. The process of serializing and reserializing JSON objects is a bit  
expensive in terms of performance, especially when it comes to large objects. System.Text.Json  
has been built from scratch by the .NET team to be the native library for dealing with JSON in your  
.NET apps. The main goal of the library is to improve the process of serialization and deserialization,  
as it’s generally fast and efficient. So, the overall advice here is to use System.Text.Json over  
other packages when performance is a high priority, even though there are some trade-offs, as other  
libraries may be richer with more features.  
Leveraging the aforementioned features and tips can noticeably accelerate your app’s speed and  
efficiency. However, keep in mind that optimization is not always needed. For simple UIs or apps that  
deal with small amounts of data, having a deep level of optimization will decrease the development  
time and make the code a bit complicated, and the results won’t be noticed. So, good optimization  
will give great results only if it’s implemented at the right time.  
Next, we will look at how Blazor re-renders the components in the hierarchy, and how we can prevent  
useless re-renders to keep the UI performant using the ShouldRender method, especially if we  
have hundreds and thousands of components within a page.  
# Rendering optimization with ShouldRender  
In order to introduce the ShouldRender method and explain how to use it, first, we need to  
understand how parameters and events can affect the rendering of components in Blazor.  
Blazor components exist in a hierarchy, with a root component that has child components, each  
child component can have its own child components, and so on. The re-render happens in the  
following scenario\:  
•  
When a component receives an event or a parameter changes, it re-renders itself and passes a  
new set of parameter values to its child components  
•  
Each child component decides whether to re-render or not based on the type and value of the  
parameter values it receives\:  
 If the parameter values are primitive types \(such as string, int, DateTime, and bool\)  
and they have not changed, the child component does not re-render  
 If the parameter values are non-primitive types \(such as complex models, event callbacks,  
or RenderFragment values\) or they have changed, the child component re-renders  
•  
This process continues recursively down the component hierarchy until all affected components  
are re-rendered or skipped 260  
Giving Your App a Speed Boost  
This process of re-rendering is expensive, and it’s very common too, as all the components are in the  
parent-child relationship. Blazor’s ComponentBase class has a virtual method called ShouldRender  
and returns a bool value. By default, ShouldRender returns true, and the method gets called  
after OnParametersSet and before BuildRenderTree, which we learned about in Chapter 1,  
Understanding the Anatomy of a Blazor WebAssembly Project. If ShouldRender returns false, the  
component won’t be re-rendered, so taking advantage of the ShouldRender method can prevent  
many useless renderings, keeping the app performant.  
Let’s see an actual example to understand how to use ShouldRender in a real-world scenario. On  
the Index page of the BooksStore project, we have the DataListView component, which renders  
the collection of books returned from the API as a BookCard component. The Index component  
passes a List\<Book\> object to DataListView, while DataListView passes a Book object  
for each BookCard component.  
Initially, when the app runs, a welcome modal pops up on the screen. This triggers a change in the  
state of the Index page, and based on what we mentioned earlier in this section about the issue of  
re-rendering, the Index page will supply a new copy of the List\<Book\> object to DataListView,  
which will also supply a new copy of the Book object to each BookCard. So, whenever the welcome  
modal pops up or is closed, a change that’s not related to the logic of the app causes DataListView  
and each BookCard to be re-rendered. The process is fast and unnoticeable because we have only  
3 books, but if the API is returning 500 books, for example, every time you close the popup or click  
on the paging buttons that change the state of the Index page, you will notice that the app will lag.  
This is where ShouldRender comes into play. We know that once the books are retrieved from  
the API and each BookCard is rendered, the changes that affect the Index page shouldn’t affect the  
rendering of the BookCard components.  
Before we resolve the issue, let’s see practically how each BookCard is being re-rendered every time  
the state of the Index page is changed.  
Open the BookCard component in the Shared folder, override the OnAfterRender life cycle  
method, and add the following code\:  
...  
protected override void OnAfterRender\(bool firstRender\)  
\{  
Console.WriteLine\(\$"BookCard rendered for book  
'\{Book.Title\}'"\);  
\}  
...  
The OnAfterRender method will be triggered whenever the BookCard component gets rendered.  
Now, run the API and the Blazor project. When the page is rendered for the first time, you will see  
the following in the console window of Developer Tools in the browser\: Rendering optimization with ShouldRender 261  
Figure 11.1 – BookCard OnAfterRender method gets triggered  
That’s expected, as it’s the first render, but if you click the X button in the modal or the Discover It  
button, the state of the Index page will change, and you will notice the same messages will be printed  
again in the console window. That’s because each BookCard gets rendered again.  
The BookCard component won’t change unless the Book parameter with its properties is changed;  
otherwise, the rendering result will stay the same during the component’s lifetime. So, to prevent  
unnecessary re-rendering, we will do the following\:  
1. Declare two private fields in the component’s @code section, one called \_oldBookId of  
type string and another called \_shouldRerender of type bool\:  
...  
private string \_oldBookId = string.Empty;  
private bool \_shouldRerender = false;  
... 262  
Giving Your App a Speed Boost  
2. In the OnParametersSet method, which is called when the component receives new parameter  
values from its parent component, we compare the current Book.Id with \_oldBookId. If they  
are different, it means that the book has changed, and the component needs to be re-rendered.  
We update \_oldBookId and set \_shouldRerender to true, and if the IDs match, we  
can skip the re-rendering, so we set \_shouldRerender to false in the else block\:  
...  
protected override void OnParametersSet\(\)  
\{  
if \(Book == null\)  
throw new ArgumentNullException\(nameof\(Book\)\);  
if \(Book.Id.Equals\(\_oldBookId\)\)  
\{  
\_oldBookId = Book.Id;  
\_shouldRerender = true;  
\}  
else  
\{  
\_shouldRerender = false;  
\}  
\}  
...  
3. Finally, we can override the ShouldRender method and let it return the \_shouldRerender  
value, which will be false most of the time, so the component won’t be re-rendered\:  
...  
protected override bool ShouldRender\(\)  
\{  
return \_shouldRerender;  
\}  
...  
Now, if you run the project again and monitor the console window, you will notice that the messages  
being written inside OnAfterRender will be printed only at the first rendering; then, re-rendering  
will be skipped.  
Note  
You shouldn’t always override ShouldRender and prevent re-rendering. This approach  
should only be taken when your component UI doesn’t change after the first render, regardless  
of the parameter values. Another example where ShouldRender is needed is while adding  
or manipulating items within a list that you don’t want to be rendered until the full list is ready. Decreasing the initial download size with assembly lazy loading 263  
In the next chapter, we will learn how Blazor renders the components internally with RenderTree  
so we can optimize even more whenever we need to.  
Next, we will cover a powerful Blazor WebAssembly feature that can shrink the initial load size of  
the app, which makes it load faster when it opens. This will give us fully optimized software not only  
during runtime but also during initialization.  
# Decreasing the initial download size with assembly lazy  
# loading  
In single-page applications in general and Blazor WebAssembly specifically, the full app packages,  
scripts, and stylesheets are downloaded for the first time to the browser so the app is fully functional  
on the client side. The average Blazor WebAssembly app has a size of 2 MB when it is published. That’s  
not very big, but when the app gets more complicated and more packages and assemblies are involved,  
the size can increase significantly.  
In this section, we will learn about Blazor WebAssembly’s lazy loading feature, which was released  
in .NET 6.0 to help reduce the initial download size to make first-time loading faster. Additionally,  
Blazor provides some out-of-the-box features, such as runtime relinking, compression, and trimming,  
that decrease the app size, but we will cover those features in the Blazor WebAssembly app prerelease  
final checks section Chapter 14, Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps.  
By default, when you run the app for the first time, all the assemblies that are used are downloaded.  
For huge apps with large assemblies, that could decrease the startup time until all the assemblies are  
ready. In .NET 6.0, Blazor introduced the lazy loading feature, which waits for some defined assemblies  
to load until they are required instead of loading them at startup time.  
To use the lazy loading feature effectively, you should organize your solution with Razor Class Library  
projects when possible. For example, suppose you have an e-commerce app with a statistics page that  
shows charts of your sales. You can put the chart components in a separate Razor Class Library project  
and mark it for lazy loading. This way, the chart assembly will only be loaded when you navigate to  
the statistics page, not when you launch the app. This can improve the app’s startup performance and  
save bandwidth, especially if the statistics page is rarely accessed or restricted to certain users.  
Let’s see a practical example of lazy loading an assembly in our BooksStore project. In addition to  
the main Blazor WebAssembly project, we have a Razor Class Library project called BooksStore.  
Blazor.Components. This project contains reusable components mostly used in the BookForm  
page, the page the admin uses to add new books to the system. We can mark the BooksStore.  
Blazor.Components package to be lazily loaded when the admin navigates to /book/form  
instead of loading it at first.  
Let’s see how the assemblies are being loaded first before we start achieving the desired outcome. Run  
the Blazor project and open a new private window in your browser, as all the DLLs and other app files  
are cached in the normal browser instance that you use for testing. Open the Network tab in Developer 264  
Giving Your App a Speed Boost  
Tools in the browser, then navigate to the Index page of the app \(https\://localhost\:7166\).  
You will notice all the JavaScript files and DLLs are loaded, including BooksStore.Blazor.  
Components, as shown here\:  
Figure 11.2 – The files and assemblies loaded for the first time  
Now, let’s get started with implementing assembly lazy loading for BooksStore.Blazor.  
Components so that this package is installed when we navigate to the /book/form page\:  
1. Set BooksStore.Blazor.Components to be loaded when navigating to the /book/  
2\. form page.  
Open the BooksStore.csproj file in the Blazor project and add the following snippet,  
which will mark BooksStore.Blazor.Components.dll to be lazily loaded\:  
...  
\<ItemGroup\>  
\<BlazorWebAssemblyLazyLoad  
Include="BooksStore.Blazor.Components.dll" /\>  
\</ItemGroup\>  
...  
By just adding this, BooksStore.Blazor.Components won’t be loaded at the first load  
of the app anymore. So, next, we need to modify App.razor so it will load BooksStore.  
Blazor.Components when navigating to the /book/form page. 3\. 4. 5. Decreasing the initial download size with assembly lazy loading 265  
In App.razor, add the following namespaces and inject LazyAssemblyLoader and  
ILogger\<App\>. LazyAssemblyLoader is the service that’s responsible for loading the  
desired assemblies\:  
...  
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing  
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore  
.Components.WebAssembly.Services  
@using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging  
@using System.Reflection;  
@inject LazyAssemblyLoader AssemblyLoader  
@inject ILogger\<App\> Logger  
...  
Add a @code section and define a List\<Assembly\> instance\:  
...  
@code  
\{  
private List\<Assembly\> \_lazyLoadedAssemblies =  
new\(\);  
\}  
Define a method that takes a NavigationContext parameter. This parameter contains  
information about the current navigation. The method will be assigned to an EventCallback  
named OnNavigateAsync in the Router component we learned about in the Understanding  
routers and pages section in Chapter 4, Navigation and Routing. The method will check whether  
the user has navigated to /book/form. If so, it will load the assembly from BooksStore.  
Blazor.Components.dll and add it to \_lazyLoadedAssembliesList\:  
...  
private async Task OnNavigateAsync\(NavigationContext  
args\)  
\{  
try  
\{  
if \(args.Path.Equals\("book/form",  
StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase\)\)  
\{  
var assemblies = await AssemblyLoader  
.LoadAssembliesAsync\(  
new\[\] \{ "BooksStore  
.Blazor.Components.dll" \}\);  
\_lazyLoadedAssemblies  
.AddRange\(assemblies\); 266  
Giving Your App a Speed Boost  
\}  
\}  
catch \(Exception ex\)  
\{  
Logger.LogError\("Error\: \{Message\}",  
ex.Message\);  
\}  
\}  
...  
6. In the markup section, assign the previous method to OnNavigateAsync EventCallback  
of the Router component, and assign the \_lazyLoadedAssemblies list to the  
AdditionalAssemblies parameter of the Router component too, as shown here\:  
...  
\<Router AppAssembly="@typeof\(App\).  
Assembly" AdditionalAssemblies="\_  
lazyLoadedAssemblies" OnNavigateAsync="OnNavigateAsync"\>  
...  
OnNavigateAsync will be triggered when the user navigates between pages, so, based  
on the written logic, when the user navigates to /book/form, BooksStore.Blazor.  
Components.dll should be loaded.  
Now, let’s make sure that what we have done is working properly. Let’s run the project again, open it in  
a private window one more time, and monitor the Network tab. The first thing we should notice is that  
BooksStore.Blazor.Components is no longer loaded when we open the app for the first time\:  
Figure 11.3 – BooksStore.Blazor.Components not loaded at first launch  
Then, log in with the admin account so the Add Book button appears in the menu. Click on the Add  
Book button, which will take you to /book/form. You will notice in the Network tab that the  
BooksStore.Blazor.Components.dll file is loaded the moment you navigate to that page\: Summary 267  
Figure 11.4 – BooksStore.Blazor.Components is loaded when navigating to /book/form  
Note  
You can mark multiple assemblies to be lazily loaded, and you can load multiple assemblies  
at the same time. The LoadAssembliesAsync method accepts a collection of assembly  
names to load, but for the purpose of our example, we need only to lazily load one assembly.  
Assembly lazy loading is a powerful feature and has a clear impact on the loading time and size of  
an app, especially when you have an enterprise-level application with many large assemblies. One  
more reminder\: defining a good separation in your solution’s projects is a crucial factor in being able  
to utilize the assembly lazy loading feature. For example, components that are not always accessed,  
are quite large, and reference multiple packages should be placed into a different project so you can  
mark them to be lazily loaded.  
# Summary  
This chapter discussed the importance of optimizing the performance of a software application beyond  
ensuring that it is fully functional. The focus was on Blazor WebAssembly and the various features  
it provides to help improve app performance. The chapter covered three main areas\: increasing  
component efficiency, rendering optimization with ShouldRender, and decreasing app size with lazy  
loading. The Virtualize component was introduced, along with guidelines for improving Blazor  
components’ efficiency, especially in data-intensive applications. The ShouldRender method was  
also discussed. We highlighted its importance in controlling and optimizing the rendering process to  
improve app performance. Finally, the chapter explored Blazor’s lazy loading feature, which reduces  
the app’s initial size and speeds up the load time.  
After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following\:  
•

# RenderTree in Blazor  
We have seen how we develop components, manipulate the UI, build forms, and optimize our  
components and project for faster and more efficient performance. It’s now time to go deep and learn  
how Razor components are compiled and how Blazor manipulates the UI you see in the browser.  
We will start by learning a bit more about the difference between Single-Page Applications \(SPAs\) and  
traditional web apps in terms of how the UI works, then we will go deeper by defining RenderTree in  
Blazor and what happens to .razor files at compilation. After covering the theory, we will develop a  
simple component using purely C\# and learn about how to take advantage of this advanced scenario,  
helping us build more performant apps.  
This chapter covers some advanced topics that may not be directly relevant for practical applications  
of Blazor and day-to-day work, but they can help you gain a deeper understanding of how Blazor  
works under the hood and go through scenarios that require a high level of optimization. If you are  
curious about the inner workings of Blazor, this chapter is for you. This chapter will cover the following\:

RenderTree in Blazor  
# How rendering happens in SPAs  
What you see in any web app, in the UI, is the result of the rendering process of the HTML code that  
represents the page or components.  
In traditional web apps, when the browser requests the page, the server either sends a full HTML  
page in the case of static web apps, or, in situations of apps such as ASP.NET MVC, it constructs a  
full HTML string after doing data and UI manipulation, and then sends it to the client. The browser  
takes that HTML and renders it as is.  
On the other hand, in the case of SPAs, the browser initially sends a request and receives a simple  
HTML document alongside the JavaScript \(JS\) libraries, or the DLLs if the framework is Blazor. The  
browser renders that simple page, then the logic of the JS or .NET library starts to build HTML pieces  
and injects or replaces them in the UI. This all happens on the browser side through a process known  
as manipulating the Document Object Model \(DOM\).  
What is the DOM?  
Basically, when the browser renders a piece of HTML, it builds a programmatic representation for  
that document in a tree-structure manner. Each node of that tree represents an object inside the  
document. This programmatic interface wraps all the document’s elements, content, and attributes.  
The DOM is what is used to manipulate the UI of the application. Let’s see an example in the following  
HTML document\:  
\<!DOCTYPE html\>  
\<html lang="en"\>  
\<head\>  
\<title\>Title\</title\>  
\</head\>  
\<body\>  
\<h1\>Welcome message\</h1\>  
\<button\>Update Message\</button\>  
\</body\>  
\</html\>  
The previous HTML represents a full document, and its DOM can be represented as follows\: How rendering happens in SPAs 271  
Figure 12.1 – DOM for the HTML document  
Interactive apps provide a rich UI that’s updated correspondingly in a quick and performant fashion. For  
example, when adding a new data item \(a book, for example\), the UI reflects the changes immediately,  
instead of requesting the full page from the server by making a full reload.  
Updating the DOM using JS  
In the previous example of the message and the button, very basically, to update the text inside the  
\<h1\> tag, we will add a little JS script to update the content when clicking on the button. The following  
script added at the end of \<body\> will perform the update by accessing the \<h1\> tag from the DOM  
and performing the message update\:  
...  
\<button onclick="updateMessage\(\)"\>Update Message\</button\>  
\<script\>  
function updateMessage\(\) \{  
var firstElement = document.body.children\[0\];  
firstElement.innerHTML = 'Updated message';  
\}  
\</script\>  
\</body\>  
In the snippet, we have referenced the \<h1\> tag as it’s the first child within the body of the document;  
then, we used its innerHTML property to update the content.  
If you open the HTML document and click the Update message button, you will notice that the  
message gets updated. This is a very basic example, but it highlights the core principle of advanced  
web apps and SPAs.  
Of course, to reference elements, you can use more complex selectors, such as using the ID of the  
tag or the classes applied to it, but this example just showed how we can manipulate the DOM in a  
basic manner. 272  
RenderTree in Blazor  
While you are using any modern social media platform, you’ll notice how fast it is in updating the  
UI despite how complicated it is. When a new post is received, it directly pops up in the UI without  
the need to update the full page or refresh it. In complex apps built with modern frameworks such  
as ReactJS, Angular, or Blazor, manipulating the DOM as efficiently as possible is the key factor in  
choosing the framework and building the UI.  
In the next section, we will see how Blazor updates the DOM internally using what is called RenderTree.  
# What is RenderTree in Blazor?  
While developing components in Blazor and using some bindings, we don’t update the DOM directly.  
Between our components and the DOM, Blazor creates an in-memory programmatic lightweight  
object called RenderTree that represents the current DOM’s state.  
Due to the nature of RenderTree as a C\# object, it’s easy to manipulate its state and content instead  
of manipulating the DOM directly, because in SPAs, the process of manipulating the DOM is heavy  
and complex. When a change occurs in the app and it requires the UI to be updated, Blazor updates  
the state of RenderTree and then compares the updated status with the original one using an  
advanced diffing algorithm. The algorithm is responsible for identifying the differences between the  
original state and the new one in an efficient manner. This all happens in RenderTree, rather than  
in the DOM directly, taking only the differences and applying only what has changed to the DOM,  
which leads to a very performant operation.  
The great thing about SPAs is that you can have heavy client-side logic and operations and then they  
are outputted on the UI, so instead of reflecting the changes that happen in the logic directly to the  
UI, it finalizes the operation, checks for changes that happened to the UI, and finally, applies them. In  
the Controlling the rendering using the @key attribute section later in this chapter, we will see with an  
example how RenderTree updates the DOM very efficiently, but for now, let’s see how it’s structured.  
Note  
Blazor doesn’t re-render the full element or component every time. If you update text within  
a \<p\> tag, only the text inside the tag gets updated; everything else remains as is through a  
sufficient process or operation.  
Understanding the structure of the component in RenderTree  
When you build any component in Blazor using a .razor file, basically, at compile time, this Razor  
file turns into a normal C\# class and the markup gets translated into RenderTree. Every component  
inherits from the ComponentBase class, which contains a method called BuildRenderTree  
and is supplied with a parameter of the RenderTreeBuilder type, which is used to build the  
RenderTree instance of the component. What is RenderTree in Blazor? 273  
If we check the compiled code of the default Counter.razor page of any Blazor project, we will  
see the following class\:  
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;  
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Rendering;  
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web;  
namespace RenderTreesSample.Pages  
\{  
\[RouteAttribute\("/counter"\)\]  
public partial class Counter \: ComponentBase  
\{  
protected override void  
BuildRenderTree\(RenderTreeBuilder \_\_builder\)  
\{  
\_\_builder.OpenComponent\<PageTitle\>\(0\);  
\_\_builder.AddAttribute\(1, "ChildContent",  
\(RenderFragment\)\(\(\_\_builder2\) =\>  
\{  
\_\_builder2.AddContent\(2, "Counter"\);  
\}  
\)\);  
\_\_builder.CloseComponent\(\);  
\_\_builder.AddMarkupContent\(3, "\\r\\n\\r\\n"\);  
\_\_builder.AddMarkupContent\(4,  
"\<h1\>Counter\</h1\>\\r\\n\\r\\n"\);  
\_\_builder.OpenElement\(5, "p"\);  
\_\_builder.AddAttribute\(6, "role",  
"status"\);  
\_\_builder.AddContent\(7, "Current count\: "\);  
\_\_builder.AddContent\(8, currentCount\);  
\_\_builder.CloseElement\(\);  
\_\_builder.AddMarkupContent\(9, "\\r\\n\\r\\n"\);  
\_\_builder.OpenElement\(10, "button"\);  
\_\_builder.AddAttribute\(11, "class",  
"btn btn-primary"\);  
\_\_builder.AddAttribute\(12, "onclick",  
global\:\:Microsoft.AspNetCore  
.Components.EventCallback.Factory  
.Create\<MouseEventArgs\>\(this,  
IncrementCount\)\);  
\_\_builder.AddContent\(13, "Click me"\);  
\_\_builder.CloseElement\(\);  
\} 274  
RenderTree in Blazor  
private int currentCount = 0;  
private void IncrementCount\(\)  
\{  
currentCount++;  
\}  
\}  
\}  
As you can see, the same Counter.razor file that has a little piece of markup and a small, one-line C\#  
method, has turned into a giant class. That’s the magic of Blazor. If you notice the BuildRenderTree  
method, it constructs the same component content of the .razor file created by the default Blazor  
project template but using pure C\# objects and methods.  
Note  
To be able to see the generated classes from .razor files, make sure to add  
\<EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles\>true\</EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles\>  
\<CompilerGeneratedFilesOutputPath\>.\</CompilerGenerated  
FilesOutputPath\> to the .csproj file of your Blazor app inside the \<PropertyGroup\>  
tag. Then, when you build the project, you can find the compiled files in the following path\:  
Project\_Root\_Folder/ Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor.SourceGenerators/  
Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor.SourceGenerators.RazorSourceGenerator  
Also, make sure to disable them as they will affect the upcoming build operations.  
Understanding RenderTree’s sequence numbering of elements  
A very important thing to notice in every method that is added to RenderTree, such as  
OpenComponent, AddAttribute, and AddMarkupContent, is that they all receive a static  
number as the first parameter and that’s the sequential number for every node in the tree. This is the  
number being used by the RenderTree diffing algorithm to determine the differences when the  
state changes. The number must be sequential and it’s preferable for it to be a static raw number, not  
referenced from a variable or calculated inside a loop.  
Because RenderTree’s goal is to minimize the changes to be made to the DOM as much as possible,  
the sequential number is an important part of the process. The following example shows how sequential  
numbering can help with making the process more efficient\:  
1. Modify the Counter component by adding a bool variable called showCounter to the  
@code section, and a method to toggle the value of that variable, as shown\:  
...  
private bool showCounter = true;  
private void ToggleCounter\(\)  
\{ What is RenderTree in Blazor? 275  
// Toggle the value of the showCounter variable  
showCounter = !showCounter;  
\}  
...  
2. Wrap the \<p\> tag that renders the currentCounter variable in an if condition to hide it  
if showCounter is set to false\:  
...  
@if \(showCounter\)  
\{  
\<p role="status"\>Current count\: @currentCount\</p\>  
\}  
...  
3\. Add a button after the Click me button to toggle the counter visibility\:  
...  
\<button class="btn btn-danger"  
@onclick="ToggleCounter"\>Show/Hide Counter\</button\>  
...  
After running the app and navigating to the /counter page, you should see the following\:  
Figure 12.2 – Updated Counter page  
Let’s suppose that RenderTree builds the components and gives the \<p\> tag the sequential number  
2 and the Click me button the number 3, as shown in the following table\: 276  
RenderTree in Blazor  
Sequential Number Element  
2 \<p\> tag that wraps the currentCounter value  
3 Click me \<button\> tag  
Table 12.1 – The settings of the RenderTree state  
When the user clicks the Show/Hide Counter button, the \<p\> tag will be hidden, so the Blazor app  
must take the following step only to update the DOM\: remove the element with sequence number 2.  
If we are building the same component manually, as we will do in the next section, instead of using a  
fixed sequence number, we will use a variable and its value will increase by the number of components  
in the UI. In such a case, if we suppose that the \<p\> tag is the second element, as shown in Table 8.1,  
and the sequence number is stored in a variable called sequenceNumber, we will have the following\:  
Sequential Number Element  
sequenceNumber + 2 \<p\> tag that wraps the currentCounter value  
sequenceNumber + 3 Click me \<button\> tag  
Table 12.2 – The settings of the RenderTree state with variable sequence numbers  
After the user clicks Show/Hide Counter to hide the counter from the UI, RenderTree has to do  
additional calculations to detect the changes, and after \<p\> gets removed, it has to give new sequence  
numbers to all the components after it.  
With that, you should have a good idea of how things are going under the hood. Let’s now try to build  
a basic component using RenderTree directly.  
# Building a component with RenderTree  
Building components can be done using just a .razor file, which is the recommended approach  
most of the time, but it’s good to learn how to also build them using RenderTree, to learn how  
things work under the hood. This will help you build better components with Razor. For example,  
with RenderTree you can control how Blazor determines the changes to render in the UI, which  
can improve performance in some special cases. We will see an example of this in the Controlling the  
rendering using the @key directive section.  
It’s rare to encounter a scenario where you’re required to use the RenderTree method, and it’s also  
not recommended, as building complex components is extremely hard with RenderTree compared  
to .razor files. Building a component with RenderTree 277  
To keep things simple, we will build the same little UI with the \<h1\> tag and \<button\> and configure  
it to update its content when we click on the button as we did in the Updating the DOM using JS  
subsection earlier in the chapter. The result in Razor should look like the following\:  
@page "/render-tree-demo"  
\<h1\>Welcome \</h1\>  
\<button class="btn btn-primary"  
@onclick="UpdateName"\>Update Name\</button\>  
@code \{  
private string name = "Blazor";  
private void UpdateName\(\)  
\{  
name = ".NET";  
\}  
\}  
Let’s achieve the same thing but with RenderTree\:  
1\. 2. In the Pages folder, create a new C\# class file, instead of a .razor file, and call  
it MessageViewer.cs.  
The Razor component inherits from the ComponentBase class, so let’s implement that  
and add the \[Route\] attribute, which is equivalent to the @page directive in Razor to set a  
route value for the page\:  
\[Route\("message-viewer"\)\]  
public class MessageViewer \: ComponentBase  
\{  
\}  
3. Inside the class, we need to declare a string variable and a method called UpdateMessage  
to update its content\:  
...  
private string \_message = "Original message";  
private void UpdateMessage\(\)  
\{  
\_message = "Updated message";  
\}  
... 278  
RenderTree in Blazor  
4\. Override the BuildRenderTree method that we will use to build the component\:  
protected override void  
BuildRenderTree\(RenderTreeBuilder builder\)  
\{  
\}  
5. Now, we can use the builder object and its methods to build the markup, as we have seen earlier  
in the Counter component. We will start by opening an \<h1\> tag with fixed text content  
inside, adding further HTML content with the \_message variable, and finally, closing the tag\:  
builder.OpenElement\(0, "h1"\); // Used to open an HTML  
element  
builder.AddContent\(1, "Message\: "\); // Add content  
inside the HTML element  
builder.AddContent\(2, \_message\);  
builder.CloseElement\(\); // Used to close an open  
element  
The previous code will render the equivalent of the following code in Razor\:  
\<h1\> Message\: @\_message\</h1\>  
Create the button and add its class and @onclick attributes. The value of @onclick is an  
EventCallback instance and we can use the EventCallback.Factory.Create  
method to assign the value\:  
...  
builder.OpenElement\(3, "button"\);  
builder.AddAttribute\(4, "class", "btn btn-primary"\);  
// Add attribute with its name and value  
builder.AddAttribute\(5, "onclick",  
EventCallback.Factory.Create\(this, UpdateMessage\)\);  
// Used to set the value of the @onclick to the  
UpdateMessage method  
builder.AddContent\(6, "Update message"\); // Add the  
text of the button  
builder.CloseElement\(\);  
...  
Our component is now ready, but if you look at the original Razor code and the final C\# code we  
have written, you will notice how complicated it is to build with RenderTreeBuilder. It’s very  
easy to make mistakes in the tags, sequence number, and so on, which will lead to unlikely behaviors.  
To see the result, run the project and navigate to /message-viewer. You should have just the  
following component\: Controlling the rendering using the @key directive 279  
Figure 12.3 – MessageViewer component built with RenderTree  
If you click the Update message button, you will notice the text changes to the updated message.  
# Controlling the rendering using the @key directive  
When it comes to rendering collections by iterating over the items and rendering some UI elements,  
the powerful mechanism of Blazor RenderTree and its diffing algorithm will observe the changes  
happening to the list \(insert, update, and delete\) and update the UI accordingly. Blazor assigning and  
indexing for each item gets rendered in the UI based on the items in the list at runtime. That’s the  
normal approach for most cases.  
Because the sequence numbers are assigned at runtime, Blazor will start sequentially from the first  
item in the list to the last. So, let’s create a sample component that will simulate the scenario, as follows\:  
1\. 2. In the Pages folder, create a Razor component and call it key-directive-sample.razor.  
Write the following code inside it\:  
@page "/key-directive-sample"  
\<h3\>Key Attribute Sample\</h3\>  
\<ul\>  
@foreach \(var item in numbers\)  
\{  
\<li\>@item\</li\>  
\}  
\</ul\>  
\<button @onclick="Insert"\>Sort\</button\>  
@code \{  
private int counter = 4;  
private List\<int\> numbers = new List\<int\>  
\{  
0, 1, 2, 3  
\};  
private void Insert\(\) 280  
RenderTree in Blazor  
\{  
numbers.Insert\(0, counter++\);  
\}  
\}  
If you run the project and navigate to /key-directive-sample, you will notice just a bullet list of  
numbers with a button. If you click on the button, a new number will be inserted at the top of the list\:  
Figure 12.4 – KeyAttributeSample component’s initial state  
Blazor will assign a sequence number for each \<li\> element in the loop initially and for each new  
item being inserted. The following table shows the sequence numbers for the items based on the 0  
index for the sample\:  
Sequential Number Element  
0 \<li\>0\</li\>  
1 \<li\>1\</li\>  
2 \<li\>2\</li\>  
3 \<li\>3\</li\>  
Table 12.3 – The sequence numbers of the numbers list in the UI Controlling the rendering using the @key directive 281  
That works fine, but if we insert a new item at the top of the list, how will RenderTree know to  
preserve sequence number 0 for element \<li\>0\</li\>? If we click the Insert button, number 4 will  
be added to the top and Blazor will give the new element a new sequence number starting from 0. That  
means all the existing items will be pushed down in terms of sequence number, and RenderTree  
will lose the tracking of the initial status and will end up rerendering the list, because the elements  
will have the following new sequence numbers\:  
Sequential Number Element  
0 \<li\>4\</li\>  
1 \<li\>0\</li\>  
2 \<li\>1\</li\>  
3 \<li\>2\</li\>  
4 \<li\>3\</li\>  
Table 12.4 – The sequence numbers of the numbers list after inserting a number  
Despite the expected results showing up in the UI, the approach used was not efficient for the  
following reasons\:  
•  
•  
Blazor must assign a new sequence number and will lose track of the original state for some  
elements, or maybe all of them in the case of inserting a number at the top of the list. That leads  
to rerendering and affects the performance of the app.  
If you have text input elements for each item, due to the rerendering, the cursor focus will be  
lost, and the state will be back to its original state which leads to unlikely behaviors.  
To resolve that, we need a mechanism to tell RenderTree explicitly what the key is of each rendered  
item, so when any modification happens to the data, RenderTree knows exactly what elements  
were affected and it only updates them in the DOM.  
In the previous example, let us assume RenderTree knows how to map each \<li\> tag for a specific  
known key instead of giving it a new one automatically. When an item is added to the beginning of  
the list, it knows that none of the other items have changed, so it only applies element insertion at the  
top, which is very efficient and keeps the state of the unmodified items.  
Blazor provides us with an attribute called @key. We can use it to control the mapping process of  
RenderTree, especially within the loops. RenderTree will use the supplied value as a key for  
the element to be used in the diffing algorithm and detect the changes. 282  
RenderTree in Blazor  
To improve the previous example, all we need to do is to add the @key value for the \<li\> element  
inside foreach, and give it the value of the number being added, as shown\:  
...  
@foreach \(var item in numbers\)  
\{  
\<li @key="item"\>@item\</li\>  
\}  
...  
The value of @key must be unique; otherwise, the app will throw an exception. So, you can use either  
the object itself you are iterating, or use the Id property of the object. In the case of rendering a list  
of books, for example, you can use the ID of the book as the value for it.  
Note  
You should use @key when you render a list in the UI that can change, for example by adding or  
removing items. However, when you render a static list or a list that only grows at the end, you don’t  
need @key because Blazor will keep the sequence numbers intact. To learn more about how and  
when to use it in more detail, check out the following link\: https\://learn.microsoft.  
com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/?view=aspnetcore-7.0\#use-  
key-to-control-the-preservation-of-elements-and-components.  
With that, you have learned more about Blazor and how great, efficient, and clever this framework is.  
# Summary  
In this chapter, we went over how Blazor handles the DOM manipulation process using an abstraction  
layer called RenderTree between the DOM and our components. We went over how things work  
inside Blazor, then built a component using purely C\# with RenderTreeBuilder. Finally, we saw a  
new directive called @key that helps us have a more efficient rendering process and more predictable  
output when rendering collections.  
So, after building components in the previous chapter, this one has completed the picture and has fed  
our curiosity. But the most important takeaways of this chapter are as follows\:  
•  
Blazor uses RenderTree to track changes in the UI, aggregate them, and apply them to the  
•  
•  
DOM efficiently.  
RenderTree doesn’t rerender the markup every time an update is made. It only updates  
what has changed in the UI.  
Use @key whenever you render a list of items, for example, within a foreach loop, to have  
a better-controlled rendering process. Further reading 283  
The next chapter will teach us how to write unit tests for both the UI components and the app logic,  
and why testing is important for making our components reliable and robust.

# WebAssembly Apps  
Testing is an essential process in software development that helps ensure that the application functions  
as expected and meets the desired quality standards. In this chapter, we will briefly introduce the  
concept of testing software, the different types of testing, and their importance, and then we will take  
a deep dive into testing Blazor WebAssembly apps.  
This chapter will introduce you to the bUnit library, which is used for writing unit tests for Blazor  
components, and then we will start writing some unit tests that cover different scenarios and different  
types of components. We will learn advanced concepts in unit testing, such as mocking and faking  
using Moq, and we will cover the built-in services in bUnit in addition to writing unit tests that cover  
those features. Lastly, we will briefly introduce the Playwright library and end-to-end \(E2E\) testing  
in Blazor WebAssembly.

# Testing Blazor components overview  
Testing software is a crucial part of the development process, not only in SPAs and Blazor WebAssembly  
but in all elements of software. Testing as a term has multiple meanings and approaches in the software  
industry and long books could be written about it, but we will focus on component testing developed  
in Blazor WebAssembly. We will examine the two testing types\: unit testing and E2E testing.  
For every feature we have developed so far, if we run the project, navigate to the target page or  
component, and use it to see if it will behave as expected, we are only conducting one type of testing.  
This type of testing is called end user testing, which is not reliable. To ensure the app logic, behavior,  
and components are working as expected, tests should be written at the code level, so more common  
and rare scenarios can be simulated.  
The first type of testing we will examine is called unit testing, which is a fundamental type of testing  
in software development. It involves testing every unit of the system, such as logic, behavior, or a  
component, in isolation from all its dependencies and environment to ensure it is functioning as expected.  
There is a misunderstanding about unit testing. I have seen many developers ignore writing tests as  
this process requires more code, which slows the development process. However, during the day-to-  
day development process, unit testing accelerates the development time in addition to making the  
components more reliable. This seems weird at first; how does writing more code make the process  
faster? But, basically, writing unit tests eliminates the need to run the project and navigate to the part  
you want to test with each change made. We will see throughout this chapter how beneficial unit tests  
will be to our project.  
The other type of testing is called E2E testing. This type of testing requires the full app with its external  
resources, such as the API, to be available. The test ensures that a specific page or feature is behaving  
as expected in integration with all the software parts. E2E testing is important, but it’s less common  
than unit tests; we will learn more about that in the Introducing Playwright for E2E tests section.  
In this chapter, we will focus on unit testing, but before we get started practically, let’s look at a summary  
of the benefits of writing great unit tests for your Blazor projects and components\:  
•  
Ensuring the reliability of the software by simulating scenarios that are not possible through  
•  
traditional testing.  
Increasing the speed of development and discovering the code outcomes quicker, especially  
for complicated cases, and iterating quickly. Getting started with testing in Blazor with bUnit 287  
•  
•  
•  
Debugging becomes easier and more enjoyable because with good unit testing you can easily  
simulate what’s going wrong at the unit level and debug it directly without needing to run the  
full app.  
Ensuring high-quality code, because writing unit tests forces the logic of the components to  
be written by following standards so that they can be tested.  
Ensuring that new changes do not break existing features. Since the testing is not manual but  
automated at the code level, and the unit tests can be run frequently, we can directly detect any  
new changes that cause existing features to fail by just running the existing tests.  
Now, let’s learn how to start writing tests for our BooksStore component.  
# Getting started with testing in Blazor with bUnit  
Blazor doesn’t have a native unit testing framework, so its great community came up with bUnit,  
which became the standard for testing Blazor apps.  
bUnit allows you to write unit tests either in C\# files or in Razor components, and it’s compatible with  
all the common testing frameworks, such as xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest.  
While testing a component, bUnit renders the target component in isolation and provides a full  
simulation, such as passing parameters, cascading values, and injecting services. It also simulates  
interactions with the component, such as clicking buttons or triggering event handlers.  
The component being tested is known as the Component Under Test \(CUT\). The term CUT is what  
we will use throughout this chapter to name the component that we are testing. The term CUT is  
derived from the term Service Under Test \(SUT\), which is a known term in testing software overall,  
not just UI components.  
After you simulate the component state you are testing, you can validate that the result is as expected.  
When it comes to the rendered UI of the component, bUnit allows you to match the desired HTML  
result with the rendering result of the component either as raw HTML or semantically. Comparing  
raw HTML means the desired output will match the rendered output if they are exactly the same text,  
just like comparing two strings. This will work fine in very simple cases, while in semantic comparison,  
the desired HTML will match the rendered HTML if they both have the same visualization when they  
are rendered inside a web browser. So, it’s recommended to assert the results with semantic matching,  
as this allows flexible and advanced matching for validation and assertion, as we will see next.  
Note  
We will use xUnit as our testing framework in this chapter. xUnit is very popular due to its  
simple and clean syntax for writing tests. It supports data-driven tests by passing parameters and  
evaluates the output easily, and it has a rich set of extensions for assertions and result validations. 288  
Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
To get started with bUnit, we can either install the bUnit project template or create a testing project  
manually and reference the bUnit package inside. I prefer to install the bUnit template, as it has some  
default tests that show some of the package’s capabilities out of the box\:  
1\. Open the terminal and run the following command\:  
dotnet new install bunit.template  
2\. 3. Open the folder that has the Visual Studio solution file and the folders of projects inside the  
solution in the terminal.  
Create a new bUnit project that uses xUnit as the testing framework and call it BooksStore.  
Tests\:  
dotnet new bunit --framework xunit -o BooksStore.Tests  
4. We need to add the BooksStore.Tests project to the BooksStore Visual Studio solution  
using the following command\:  
dotnet sln BooksStore.sln add BooksStore.Tests  
5. At the time of writing this book, the bUnit template creates a project that targets .NET 6.0; we  
are developing with .NET 7.0, so we need to upgrade. So, open the BooksStore.Tests.  
csproj file in Visual Studio and set the TargetFramework property to 7.0\:  
...  
\<TargetFramework\>net7.0\</TargetFramework\>  
...  
6. Lastly, add the BooksStore Blazor WebAssembly project as a reference to BooksStore.Tests  
so the test project can access the components and the code inside the BooksStore project\:  
dotnet add BooksStore.Tests/BooksStore.Tests.csproj  
reference BooksStore/BooksStore.csproj  
Our project is now ready to write unit tests. But before we start writing our own tests, the bUnit  
template contains a Counter.razor component and two test files, one written in a .cs file and  
the other written in a .razor file.  
Let’s open the CounterCSharpTests.cs file and see what’s inside. The file has a class called  
CounterCSharpTest and it inherits from the TestContext class that’s part of bUnit.  
TestContext provides all you need to create components under test, such as rendering, providing  
parameters, registering and injecting services, and interacting with the component elements via clicking  
a button or hovering the mouse over an element, and so on. Getting started with testing in Blazor with bUnit 289  
Inside the class, there are two methods, and each is decorated with the \[Fact\] attribute. \[Fact\]  
means this method is a unit test method that doesn’t accept any parameters. When the test is executed,  
this method will run as it is, and it will either pass or fail without any prior conditions. Other attributes,  
such as Theory, can test the method with passing parameters. If you want to learn more about xUnit,  
please refer to their official site\: https\://xunit.net/.  
Now, let’s get into the methods inside CounterCSharpTests.cs\:  
...  
\[Fact\]  
public void CounterStartsAtZero\(\)  
\{  
// Arrange  
var cut = RenderComponent\<Counter\>\(\);  
// Assert that content of the paragraph shows counter  
at zero  
cut.Find\("p"\).MarkupMatches\("\<p\>Current count\: 0\</p\>"\);  
\}  
...  
The preceding code is a unit test method called CounterStartsAtZero. As the name suggests,  
the Counter component should have a counter that starts from 0.  
The first line renders the Counter component, then it validates the text inside the \<p\> of HTML  
and ensures it matches the text Current count\: 0.  
The second test method, ClickingButtonIncrementsCounter, validates the Counter  
component. The test will pass if the counter value increases after clicking the button\:  
\[Fact\]  
public void ClickingButtonIncrementsCounter\(\)  
\{  
// Arrange  
var cut = RenderComponent\<Counter\>\(\);  
// Act - click button to increment counter  
cut.Find\("button"\).Click\(\);  
// Assert that the counter was incremented  
cut.Find\("p"\).MarkupMatches\("\<p\>Current count\: 1\</p\>"\);  
\} 290  
Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
The second line finds the button inside the Counter component and uses the Click method to  
simulate clicking the button.  
Finally, it validates that the current count will be 1.  
Those two methods demonstrate the big potential and capabilities of bUnit, including how it allows  
us to validate whether the component gets rendered as expected, or whether clicking a button inside  
the component results in the intended behavior and produces the expected results.  
The other default file created with the bUnit template, called CounterRazorTests.razor, has  
the same tests but written in a Razor file to demonstrate how you can write tests in C\# files or Razor.  
Both ways are fine and will give you the same results, but usually, when writing tests for markup, it’s  
better to host tests within a Razor file, as you have more flexibility while writing markup compared  
to writing within a string in a C\# file. Additionally, it is easier to initialize and pass parameters to the  
CUT, whereas in C\#, you need to write literal strings. In addition to using methods to pass parameters  
and initializing the CUT while in Razor, you can set up the CUT the same way you use the component  
and write markup in a normal Razor file, leveraging the power of the Razor editor in Visual Studio.  
There are multiple ways to run unit tests in Visual Studio. For the one written in the C\# file, you can  
either right-click on the test method and choose Run Tests or right-click on the class and click Run  
Tests to run all the tests inside the class.  
To fully view, navigate, and run tests in Visual Studio written in C\# or Razor, use the Test Explorer  
view. If you don’t have it open by default, make sure to open it via the View menu and then choose  
Test Explorer. If you open Test Explorer, you should see the test as follows\:  
Figure 13.1 – Test Explorer in Visual Studio Writing component unit tests with bUnit 291  
To run all the tests in the view, click on the white and green arrow button in the top left. To run a  
specific test, select it from the view and click on the second green button with a single arrow. To make  
sure all is good, click on the first button \(white and green\), and then all the tests should have a green  
tick beside them.  
Figure 13.2 – Successfully run tests in Test Explorer  
Now, the project is ready for us to start adding our own tests, which is what we will be doing next.  
# Writing component unit tests with bUnit  
We have seen the basic tests written by default in the bUnit template. In this section, we will start  
creating our own tests. We’ll write a test for the ModalPopup component we developed in the  
Developing templated components section in Chapter 3, Developing Advanced Components in Blazor.  
Writing the first component unit test  
ModalPopup is a good starting point for us as it doesn’t have dependencies and it has some parameters,  
so we can learn how to pass parameters to a CUT.  
Let’s get started\:  
1. In the BooksStore.Tests project, add the BooksStore namespaces needed inside  
\_Imports.razor so we don’t need to reference them in each test file we have\:  
...  
@using BooksStore.Shared  
@using BooksStore.Models  
@using BooksStore.Services 292  
Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
2\. 3. Create a new Razor component and name it ModalPopupTests.razor.  
Remove any markup and make the component inherit from the TestContext class\:  
@inherits TestContext  
@code \{  
\}  
4. Inside the @code section, we will define the first test, which will test that the component  
renders the modal when we pass the IsOpen parameter the value true\:  
...  
\[Fact\]  
public void ModalPopupWithIsOpenSet  
ToTrueShouldRendersCorrectly\(\)  
\{  
// Arrange  
var isOpen = true;  
var cut = Render\(@\<ModalPopup IsOpen="isOpen" /\>\);  
// Assert  
var overlayDivs = cut.FindAll\(".overlay"\);  
Assert.True\(overlayDivs.Count \> 0\);  
\}  
...  
In the preceding method, first, we defined the isOpen variable and set it to true, and then we  
used the Render method and passed the ModalPopup component as a parameter. There is a  
Render method that renders a markup and returns an instance of type IrenderedFragment.  
Render\<TComponent\>. It also renders a fragment but returns IrenderedComponent.  
Both instances allow interaction with the rendered content, but IRenderedComponent  
allows for more control of the rendered component instance.  
The other method to render a component is RenderComponent\<TComponent\>. You  
can pass the type of the component you want to render, and it will retrieve an instance of  
IRenderedComponent. Now, RenderComponent\<TComponent\> has an overload  
that accepts an array of ComponentParameter to help set the component parameters.  
In summary, both Render and RenderComponent do the same job, but each gives a  
different level of control while creating the component and the type it returns. Render has a  
more flexible way of rendering the markup or the component, while RenderComponent is  
shorter, but passing parameters will require passing them as objects within an array.  
To make sure that the component is rendered correctly, it should render a div with the class  
overlay, so we use the FindAll method and pass the .overlay element selector. FindAll  
will return all the elements that have the class overlay inside the rendered markup. So, if there Writing component unit tests with bUnit 293  
is at least one div, that means the component is rendered successfully. Assert.True is the  
method that will assert the test result, as we passed the condition to it that the overlayDivs  
collection should have at least one item.  
In Test Explorer, right-click on the new test and click on Run\:  
Figure 13.3 – Run the first ModalPopup component test  
After running the test, if a green tick mark appears beside the name of the test, as shown in Figure 13.2,  
it means that the test should pass successfully!  
Let’s write one more test to validate that when the IsOpen parameter is set to false, no elements are  
rendered in the component. Again, in ModalPopupTests.razor, add the following test method\:  
...  
\[Fact\]  
public void  
ModalPopupWithIsOpenSetToFalseShouldRenderNothing\(\)  
\{  
// Arrange  
var isOpen = false;  
var cut = Render\(@\<ModalPopup IsOpen="isOpen" /\>\);  
// Assert  
Assert.True\(cut.Nodes.Length == 0\);  
\}  
...  
This test is similar to the previous one, but this validates the closing state of the modal where no  
elements should be rendered. 294  
Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
Testing components with RenderFragment  
Let’s look at an example where we can learn how to match partial markup within the rendered  
component. We know that ModalPopup receives ChildContent and FooterContent  
render fragments that are rendered inside the modal in the open state, so we need to make sure that  
ModalPopup is rendering ChildContent and FooterContent correctly. In the next test, we  
will provide the ModalPopup component with the ChildContent parameter and make sure it’s  
rendered as expected\:  
\[Fact\]  
public void  
ModalPopupWithChildContentShouldRenderCorrectly\(\)  
\{  
// Arrange  
var cut = Render\(  
@\<ModalPopup IsOpen="true"\>  
\<ChildContent\>  
\<h2\>Testing ModalPopup\</h2\>  
\</ChildContent\>  
\</ModalPopup\>  
\);  
// Assert  
cut  
.Find\(".modal-body"\)  
.MarkupMatches\(@\<div class="modal-body"\>\<h2\>Testing  
ModalPopup\</h2\>\</div\>\);  
\}  
The preceding test passes ChildContent and sets IsOpen to true, so based on the component  
logic, the ChildContent render fragment should be rendered inside a div with the modal-  
body class. The MarkupMatches method tries to match the expected rendered result of the div  
element with the class modal-body. The matching of MarkupMatches happens semantically,  
which means the expected string and the rendered markup shouldn’t necessarily be exactly equal,  
but they should both have the same output if they are rendered within the browser. For example, let’s  
assume the rendered component has the following markup\:  
\<div class="card shadow-1 corner-radius"\>\<h1\>Title  
here\</h1\>\</div\> Writing component unit tests with bUnit 295  
Using MarkupMatches, we can compare the preceding markup with the following markup, and  
they will be equal, despite having spaces or class order differences. Both will produce the same output  
in the browser\:  
\<div class="card corner-radius shadow-1"\>  
\<h1\>Title here\</h1\>  
\</div\>  
Testing components with interaction  
The last test we will write in this section is a test that involves an interaction, such as clicking on  
a button, updating the parameters during the test execution, and triggering re-rendering for the  
component. If ModalPopup is open, it has an X button that closes it. The upcoming test will render  
ModalPopup in the closing state, then set IsOpen to true, simulate clicking the X button, and  
finally, ensure that the modal is closed and no elements are rendered\:  
...  
\[Fact\]  
public void ClickXButtonShouldCloseTheModal\(\)  
\{  
// Arrange  
var cut = RenderComponent\<ModalPopup\>\(\);  
// Act  
cut.SetParametersAndRender\(parameters =\>  
\{  
parameters.Add\(p =\> p.IsOpen, true\);  
\}\);  
cut.Find\(".close-button"\).Click\(\);  
// Arrange  
Assert.True\(cut.Nodes.Length == 0\);  
\}  
...  
This time, we used the RenderComponent method instead of Render and it set ModalPopup as  
the component type. The SetParametersAndRender method allows us to update the component  
parameter values and trigger a re-rendering for the component. After IsOpen is set to true, the  
modal should be rendered and a \<span\> tag with the close-button class should be found inside  
the markup, so we used the Find method and then the Click method, which simulates clicking  
that element. Lastly, during the assertion, we validate that there are no nodes anymore in the rendered  
component after clicking the button, as the modal should be closed. 296  
Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
We’ve created four tests that cover various scenarios including two tests to validate the initial render  
state of the ModalPopup component, another one that includes passing parameters, and one to  
validate the component logic by interacting with it. This should give you a strong foundation to write  
additional tests that cover a range of cases. The ModalPopup component is straightforward and  
doesn’t require any injected services, and its logic remains unaffected by the authentication state.  
However, for more advanced scenarios, you’ll need to explore more complex topics, which we’ll cover  
in the next section.  
# Mocking and faking tests in Blazor and bUnit  
Writing stable unit tests requires isolation for the unit under test as the unit tests should run frequently  
in different environments and on different machines. So, to keep the tests reliable, they should be written  
in isolation from external factors such as communicating with an API or asking for an access token.  
Mocking and faking are the keys to simulating the behavior of the dependencies of the unit under  
test. For example, the Index page depends on IBooksService, and the implementation we  
have is called BooksHttpClientService, which sends requests to the API to fetch the books  
needed for the Index page. If we want to test IBooksService, we need to mock it and write a fake  
implementation for the GetAllBooksAsync method so the unit test can rely on this fake service  
instead of the actual API.  
In order to mock services in .NET, there are many available packages, but Moq is the most common  
one, and it’s the one we will be using in this section.  
The mocked and fake services and implementations are known as test doubles in the world of  
software testing, and bUnit has a set of test doubles for the most common Blazor services, such as  
NavigationManager, fake authentication and authorization, and more.  
Writing tests with Moq  
A good example to start with is the BookDetails component. This component represents a page that  
renders the book’s details. The component depends on IBooksService to retrieve a book by ID.  
So, let’s see how this works\:  
1. In order to test the BookDetails component, we need to install the Moq package before  
writing the tests.  
To install the Moq package, either install it directly from NuGet in Visual Studio or run the  
following .NET CLI command within the folder of the BooksStore.Tests project\:  
dotnet add package Moq  
2\. In \_Imports.razor, add the Moq namespace\:  
@using Moq; 3\. 4. 5. Mocking and faking tests in Blazor and bUnit 297  
In the tests project, create a new Razor component called BookDetailsTests.razor.  
Add a namespace reference for BooksStore.Pages and let the component inherit from  
the TestContext class\:  
@using BooksStore.Pages.UserPages  
@inherits TestContext  
@code \{  
\}  
The test we will write should test the perfect scenario of the component that simulates the  
Book object being retrieved correctly and the component rendering the data correctly. The  
BookDetails component receives a BookId parameter in the form of a string, and then  
the component calls the GetBookByIdAsync method inside IBooksService to retrieve  
the book’s details. For this test, we need to mock IBooksService and register the mocked  
instance in the DI of TestContext\:  
\[Fact\]  
public void  
BookDetailsWithValidBookIdShouldRenderCorrectly\(\)  
\{  
// Arrange  
var mockedBookService = new  
Mock\<IBooksService\>\(\);  
mockedBookService  
.Setup\(x =\>  
x.GetBookByIdAsync\(It.IsAny\<string\>\(\)\)\)  
.Returns\(Task.FromResult\<Book?\>\(new Book  
\{  
Id = Guid.NewGuid\(\).ToString\(\),  
Title = "Test Book",  
AuthorName = "Test Author",  
Description = "Test Description",  
Price = 10  
\}\)\);  
Services.AddScoped\<IBooksService\>\(sp =\>  
mockedBookService.Object\);  
\}  
The preceding code mocks the IBooksService, then it sets up the GetBookByIdAsync  
method using the Setup method. It.IsAny\<string\>\(\), which is passed as a parameter, is  
a method provided by the Moq framework. It’s used when the parameter value is not important 298  
Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
6\. for the test, so as the name indicates, it’s any string. After that, the Returns method is used  
to define the value to return for the mocked GetBookByIdAsync. Finally, we register  
IBooksService in the DI container of TestContext using the Services property  
provided by bUnit.  
Now, we can render the BookDetails component and validate the result\:  
var cut = Render\(@\<BookDetails BookId="1" /\>\);  
cut.Find\("h2"\).MarkupMatches\(@\<h2\>Test Book\</h2\>\);  
...  
// Assert  
That’s it! Now, when you run the test, IBooksService will be injected and GetBookByIdAsync  
will be called, and the mocked book we created in step 5 will be returned. Then, the component  
will be rendered successfully, and to ensure it’s rendered correctly, we check the \<h2\> tag that  
prints the book’s title, which is Test Book in this case.  
Next, we will look at another kind of component testing, which is testing the components that require  
authentication. Let’s see how bUnit provides an easy way to fake authentication and authorization in  
the test context.  
Faking authentication and authorization in bUnit  
In the Implementing authorization and advanced authentication features section in Chapter 9,  
Authenticating and Authorizing Users in Blazor WebAssembly, we modified the BookCard component  
to show the Add to Cart button only if the user is authenticated and located in the UK, based on a  
custom policy called UK\_Customer.  
When it comes to testing scenarios involving authentication and authorization, bUnit makes the process  
much easier than you might expect. That’s because it comes with a built-in fake authentication and  
authorization infrastructure that you can readily use. With the bUnit APIs, you’ll have full control  
over faking the authentication or authorization process, with the ability to set claims, roles, policies,  
and more, in a very straightforward manner. This can greatly simplify your testing efforts, enabling  
you to focus on verifying your components’ behavior in different security scenarios without having  
to worry about the complexities of setting up real authentication and authorization infrastructure.  
Let’s write two unit tests for the BookCard component. The first will render the card without  
authentication, so there should be no Add to Cart button and it should render a message saying  
that only customers within the UK can buy the book. The second is for when the user satisfies the  
UK\_Customer policy, so the Add to Cart button should appear\:  
1. Create a new Razor component in the BooksStore.Tests project, name it BookCardTests.  
razor, and make it inherit from TestContext\:  
@inherits TestContext 2\. 3. Mocking and faking tests in Blazor and bUnit 299  
@code \{  
\}  
Create a Book instance variable called \_book to be passed for the BookCard component tests\:  
@code \{  
private Book \_book = new Book\(\)  
\{  
Id = Guid.NewGuid\(\).ToString\(\),  
AuthorName = "Test Author",  
Description = "Test Description",  
Price = 10,  
Title = "Test Book"  
\};  
\}  
Create a test method for the UK customer that validates whether the Add To Cart button  
should be rendered\:  
...  
\[Fact\]  
public void  
UsersWithUK\_CustomerPolicyShouldSeeAddtoCartButton\(\)  
\{  
// Arrange  
var authContext = this.AddTestAuthorization\(\);  
authContext.SetPolicies\("UK\_Customer"\);  
var cut = Render\(@\<BookCard Book="\_book" /\>\);  
// Assert  
cut.Find\("button"\).MarkupMathces\(@\<button  
class="main-button"\>Add to Cart\</button\>\);  
\}  
...  
The AddTestAuthorization extension method is the method that’s responsible for the  
fake authorization in bUnit. Using the authContext variable, we can call the SetPolicies  
method to set a policy \(UK\_Customer for our case\), SetClaims to set fake claims, SetRoles  
to set roles, and more. You can learn more about faking authorization in bUnit at https\://  
bunit.dev/docs/test-doubles/faking-auth.html. 300  
Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
4. Write another test method without authorization, as we should expect the same component to  
not render the Add to Cart button and render a \<p\> tag with a message inside, as follows\:  
...  
\[Fact\]  
public void UsersWithoutUK\_  
CustomersPolicyShouldNotSeeAddToCartButton\(\)  
\{  
// Arrange  
this.AddTestAuthorization\(\);  
var cut = Render\(@\<BookCard Book="\_book" /\>\);  
var buttons = cut.FindAll\("button"\);  
// Assert  
Assert.Empty\(buttons\);  
var textContent = cut.Find\("p.text-  
center"\).TextContent;  
Assert.Equal\("Books only available for sale in UK  
for the time being", textContent\);  
\}  
...  
In the second test, we didn’t provide the UK\_Customer policy, so to assert the result of the test,  
we used FindAll to find all the buttons in the markup and assert that the list is empty, and we  
validated that the markup of the \<p\> tag with the text-center class is rendered and shows  
the required text. Here, we used the TextContent property of the node. TextContent  
has the value of the content inside the tag. Then, we made sure that the content of the \<p\> tag  
is equal to the expected text using the Assert.Equal method.  
That’s fun, right? Nothing in developing software is more enjoyable than writing a lot of tests and  
having them pass every time you run them. During the last few pages, we have written 11 tests. That’s  
so satisfying and, using what we have learned in this chapter so far, you can write more tests for the  
rest of the pages and components. The following screenshot shows the state of Test Explorer at the  
end of this section\: Mocking and faking tests in Blazor and bUnit 301  
Figure 13.4 – Test Explorer with all the tests we’ve written  
bUnit is a very powerful framework. We have seen so far how it helps with writing efficient tests  
and how much flexibility it provides with writing and asserting unit tests for Blazor components.  
What we have seen so far is not everything; bUnit also provides much more in the shape of features,  
capabilities, mocks, and so on, and to discover them all, check out their simple and easy-to-follow  
documentation\: https\://bunit.dev/docs/getting-started/index.html. 302  
Testing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
Note  
Component unit testing is preferable to test the flow and observe the state of the component  
during its lifetime and while interacting with it. It’s not recommended to test a specific parameter,  
private field values, or specific methods. Testing has to be done for the overall flow and the  
purpose of the component in general.  
We have made good progress in writing unit tests. In the next section, we will briefly introduce the  
Playwright testing framework to write E2E tests for Blazor WebAssembly.  
# Introducing Playwright for E2E tests  
In E2E tests, we need to ensure that our system is fully behaving as expected, including the interaction  
with external services, such as the web API.  
Even though unit testing is more crucial than E2E testing, a great testing strategy includes all different  
types of tests, including unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, and performance tests. The reason why  
automated E2E tests are less important than unit tests is that all the components have to be available  
and running. In our case, every time you want to run E2E tests, the API has to be up and running, and  
a sandbox environment has to be available, otherwise the tests will keep adding, editing, or deleting  
data if the API doesn’t support test data. E2E tests are also slower to run, so running them all the time,  
as we can with unit tests, is not preferable.  
E2E tests complement rather than replace unit tests for the product’s overall testing. E2E testing is  
not meant to replace unit testing. Instead, it makes sure that all the features and app infrastructure  
are working together as expected. This includes the services in the DI container, the API calls, the  
serialization and deserialization of the data, and so on.  
To write E2E tests, Playwright is the ideal choice for Blazor WebAssembly. Playwright for .NET is an  
open source library that’s currently maintained by Microsoft. It provides APIs that automate browser  
tasks, which allows developers to write browser automation tests in .NET. Playwright supports most  
modern browsers, such as Chromium and Firefox, in addition to supporting mobile emulations. With  
Playwright, the .NET tests can interact with the site inside the browser, such as navigating between  
links and filing and submitting forms.  
An example test in Playwright can be built with the following steps\:  
1\. Initialize the Playwright instance.  
2\. Define the browser to use.  
3\. 4. 5. Navigate to a page inside the browser.  
Click on a button on the page.  
Ensure that the clicked button achieved the desired goal, such as navigating to another page  
or submitting a request successfully. Summary 303  
From the test context provided, you can see that the full app is included here, unlike in unit tests,  
where the CUT is the only part we focus on.  
Playwright currently supports NUnit and MSTest testing frameworks and, luckily, it has great  
documentation that explains in detail how to get started and how to utilize each feature provided  
by the package. If you are interested in exploring Playwright for .NET, feel free to check out their  
site\: https\://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro.  
This should give you a quick introduction to E2E tests and what to use to start writing them.  
Writing tests is not only about knowledge and experience; consistency and discipline play big roles  
here. Taking tests seriously from the early stages of the project helps you write high-quality components  
faster and ensures the reliability of the code through the process of development.  
# Summary  
Throughout this chapter, we have learned about testing software and especially Blazor WebAssembly  
components. First, we introduced the concept of testing, why it’s important, and the difference between  
unit testing and E2E testing. Then we introduced bUnit and set up the testing project. After that, we  
discovered the default tests written in a bUnit testing project template before starting to write our  
own, while learning gradually about bUnit’s features. While writing tests, we saw the need for mocking  
and faking services and features to satisfy the CUT. We learned about the Moq framework and the  
built-in mocking and faking services within bUnit. Finally, we introduced the Playwright library for  
.NET, which we can use to write E2E tests in Blazor WebAssembly.  
After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
Understand the importance of testing software  
Be familiar with the bUnit library and its features  
Write unit tests for different kinds of components in different scenarios  
•  
•  
Mock and fake services when needed using Moq and bUnit  
Understand the need for E2E tests and how to get started writing them  
You have developed your app and written a lot of tests for it that pass. The client, friends, family  
members, or the users who know what you are working on are excited to get their hands on what you  
are developing. So, it’s time to send them a URL and ask for their feedback. Let’s push the project and  
make it accessible online! 304

After working so hard on your app and after going through all the difficult moments while debugging  
an error or learning a new technique to build a new feature, the feeling of seeing your app online is  
priceless, regardless of how big or simple it is.  
Finally, it is that time for us. It’s time to put the app we have built so far online and make it accessible  
via a public URL and have a party after that.  
In this chapter, we will introduce some final checks to do for your Blazor WebAssembly app before  
the release; then, I will introduce you to Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted. We will also

# Blazor WebAssembly prerelease final checks  
Before releasing the Blazor WebAssembly app, it’s useful to know how the process happens and what  
things we need to configure. We will look at Ahead Of Time \(AOT\) compilation, trimming, URL  
rewriting, and Blazor time zone support to give you a better idea of whether there is anything you  
need to configure related to those topics. Let’s get started.  
AOT compilation  
By default, Blazor WebAssembly apps run in the browser via a .NET Intermediate Language \(IL\)  
interpreter implemented in WebAssembly.  
Note  
IL is the binary result of the compiled high-level .NET code, and you can learn more about IL at  
the following link\: https\://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/  
managed-code\#intermediate-language--execution.  
Since .NET code is interpreted, Blazor WebAssembly apps can be slightly slower than .NET apps that  
run on the server, particularly when performing complex calculations or manipulating large amounts  
of data. However, enabling AOT compilation during publishing can mitigate this performance issue  
by compiling the .NET code to WebAssembly before the runtime in the browser, eliminating the  
need for interpretation. This feature is called Ahead of Time because it compiles the .NET code to  
WebAssembly ahead of runtime in the browser. While AOT can improve performance, it does come  
with a cost. Enabling AOT will increase the app’s initial size, resulting in a larger publishing output  
– twice the size of publishing without AOT. This can increase the time it takes to load the app for the  
first time. So, it’s important to consider using AOT only when your app is doing heavy client-side  
computations – for example, a diagram editor app, where the app is mostly doing SVG manipulations  
on the client side. For apps that mostly depend on API calls and render the data in the client, as in  
the BooksStore project, enabling AOT will be a huge downside as it won’t add any performance  
upgrade for the client and it will increase the app’s initial download size. Blazor WebAssembly prerelease final checks 307  
To enable AOT, open the .csproj file of your Blazor project and add the following property\:  
\<PropertyGroup\>  
\<RunAOTCompilation\>true\</RunAOTCompilation\>  
\</PropertyGroup\>  
That’s all you need to enable AOT. Later, when we publish the app or build it for the release, the app  
will be compiled into WebAssembly. AOT compilation isn’t used during the development process  
because the process of compilation takes a couple of minutes to finish. It doesn’t make sense to wait  
that long every time you run the project.  
Trimming  
Trimming is another task that’s performed during the publishing phase and it happens automatically.  
Trimming basically removes unused code from the produced IL code, which reduces the size of the  
app significantly.  
If your app is using reflection features in C\#, the trimming operation cannot determine the actual  
types you are targeting, so they may be trimmed, which could result in uncertain behavior. For this  
specific scenario, you might need to configure the trimmer to ignore trimming a specific assembly or  
even the level of trimming in general.  
To ignore trimming specific assembly code, you can add the following to your project file\:  
\<ItemGroup\>  
\<TrimmerRootAssembly Include="Name\_Of\_Your\_Assembly" /\>  
\</ItemGroup\>  
RootAssembly means all the assembly and its dependencies won’t be trimmed.  
Or you can fully disable the trimming operation using the \<PublishTrimmed\> property\:  
\<PublishTrimmed\>false\</PublishTrimmed\>  
You can learn more about how to control the trimming operation at the following link\: https\://  
learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-  
options?pivots=dotnet-7-0.  
Note  
When AOT is enabled, the output won’t be trimmed as the result is native WebAssembly code,  
and that’s another reason why the AOT-compiled app is large. 308  
Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
Compression  
When publishing a Blazor WebAssembly app, the output is compressed to reduce the app size and  
increase the startup time of the app. Also, compression happens by default.  
To disable compression, which is undesirable \(as disabling it will increase the app size significantly\),  
you can add the BlazorEnableCompression property to the project file\:  
\<PropertyGroup\>  
\<BlazorEnableCompression\>false\</BlazorEnableCompression\>  
\</PropertyGroup\>  
The only scenario in which you may need to disable compression is when you publish your app to a  
host that already serves compressed files by itself, such as the AWS CloudFront Content Delivery  
Network \(CDN\). In such scenarios, also having the app files compressed by Visual Studio will increase  
the overhead for the WebAssembly runtime. You can learn more about how to publish a Blazor  
WebAssembly project to AWS and use the AWS CloudFront CDN to serve your files here\: https\://  
aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/run-blazor-based-net-web-applications-  
on-aws-serverless/.  
URL rewriting  
When you publish a standalone Blazor WebAssembly project, there will be a single HTML file called  
index.html. This file is downloaded to the browser and then bootstraps the app. For example, if  
your app is accessible through the URL https\://bookstore.example, when the user navigates  
to that URL, the server will serve the index.html file by default, which is good.  
While the user is navigating through the pages on the client side, everything should be fine. For  
example, if the user clicks on the Add Book link in NavMenu, the user will be redirected to https\://  
bookstore.example/book/form correctly as the routing and navigation process is happening  
on the client side within the browser.  
However, a problem may occur if the user navigates to https\://bookstore.example/book/  
form directly from the browser’s address bar. In this case, the browser will send the request to the  
app host, and there is nothing mapped to /book/form, so the result will be a 404 page.  
The solution for this issue is to configure the host to map any request to index.html.  
We will see how to configure the fallback URL to index.html when we deploy the project to Azure  
Static Web Apps.  
If you are planning to host your Blazor WebAssembly project on IIS, check out the following  
link\: https\://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-  
deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-7.0\#iis. Introducing Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted 309  
Disabling time zone support  
By default, the Blazor WebAssembly runtime includes a data file to make the time zone data correct.  
Disabling this feature will decrease the initial app size, in addition to improving the performance of  
some operations such as parsing and formatting dates.  
To disable the time zone feature in Blazor, you can add the following property and set it to false  
in the .csproj file\:  
\<PropertyGroup\>  
...  
\<BlazorEnableTimeZoneSupport\>false\</BlazorEnableTimeZoneSupport\>  
...  
\</PropertyGroup\>  
Keep in mind that disabling time zone support will make the app use the browser’s time zone information.  
In this section, we talked about the publishing operation and what you can configure during it.  
In the next section, we will look at another way to build and host a Blazor WebAssembly project,  
called Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted. Let’s get into it.  
# Introducing Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted  
Throughout this book, we fully focused on the Blazor WebAssembly project; even when we introduced the  
API, I kept it away so you could just focus on what matters in Blazor WebAssembly within the browser.  
What we have created during this book is called a Blazor WebAssembly standalone project, which  
means a project that serves itself and will be published without any server or backend to serve it.  
.NET already offers an out-of-the-box template for a Blazor WebAssembly project called Blazor  
WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted. This template creates a Blazor WebAssembly project, a shared  
class library project, and an ASP.NET Core API directly inside the solution. The most interesting part  
of this type of project is that the API project is responsible for serving the Blazor WebAssembly app  
to the client. In other words, you only need to host the server project and the Blazor WebAssembly  
project will be referenced inside it.  
The Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted template and hosting model are particularly useful  
when you’re building a project from scratch and need to develop both the API and the Blazor app  
together as a single unit. This approach is different from our current project, where the API and Blazor  
WebAssembly are hosted separately, resulting in two different URLs. Another big feature of using the  
ASP.NET Core Hosted model is the server-side prerendering. Blazor WebAssembly renders the UI  
and the components on the client side in the browser, but using server-side prerendering, the initial  
HTML content of the app is rendered on the server and sent back to the client in the first response.  
This improves the overall user experience and performance, in addition to giving you the ability to  
utilize Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\) in your Blazor WebAssembly apps. 310  
Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
Note  
Blazor WebAssembly server-side prerendering can be beneficial in many scenarios including  
a blog app, e-commerce, or even our BooksStore project. Prerendering allows you to add  
SEO to your app, and the app pages will load faster just like a traditional web app, which is  
essential for such scenarios.  
To not be out of topic for publishing and hosting a Blazor app, I added a prerendering sample  
for the GitHub repository of the book, which can be found at the following link\: https\://  
github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Blazor-WebAssembly/tree/  
main/Chapter\_14/AspNetCoreHostedProject/PrerenderingSample.  
Additionally, Microsoft has a great documentation page that explains the process step by  
step here\: https\://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/  
components/prerendering-and-integration?view=aspnetcore-  
7.0&pivots=webassembly.  
To create a new Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted, we need the following\:  
•  
Visual Studio\: After choosing the Blazor WebAssembly project template, make sure to check  
ASP.NET Core Hosted.  
Figure 14.1 – Creating a Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted project Publishing Blazor WebAssembly to Azure App Service 311  
•  
.NET CLI\: Use the following command\:  
dotnet new blazorwasm --hosted -o \<project-name\>  
The project has the following structure in Visual Studio\:  
Figure 14.2 – Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted project structure  
For the BooksStore project, in the GitHub repository of this book, you can find another version  
of the current project alongside the API that is Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted.  
Note  
The choice of project type comes back to the API. If you are developing the API, it’s better to go  
for Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted as you need to host one app, and the project  
template accelerates the process for you. If your project doesn’t require an API or requires  
third-party APIs or an existing hosted API, then you need to proceed with the standalone  
hosting model.  
The reason why I provided two versions of the project \(one as a standalone project and another as an  
ASP.NET Core Hosted project\) was to show you how to publish both types of projects. So, next, we  
will deploy the ASP.NET Core Hosted version to Azure App Service and have a URL to access our  
app through.  
# Publishing Blazor WebAssembly to Azure App Service  
In this section, we will publish the Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted version to the cloud,  
specifically Azure, and the hosting service will be Azure App Service. 312  
Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
Azure App Service is a Platform-as-a-Service \(PaaS\) solution that allows the deployment of web apps  
at scale. The service is fully managed by Azure and it supports different programming languages and  
frameworks, in addition to supporting containers.  
Azure App Service provides multiple deployment options to push your app to it\:  
•  
Continuous deployment\: Azure App Service supports continuous deployment from multiple  
sources, such as GitHub, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket. This means that whenever changes are  
pushed to the source code repository, the application will be built and deployed automatically  
to Azure App Service. You can learn more about continuous deployment for Azure App Service  
at https\://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-  
continuous-deployment?tabs=github.  
•  
FTP deployment\: FTPS deployment is also supported by Azure App Service. You can upload  
the project using an FTP or FTPS client. Learn more at https\://learn.microsoft.  
com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-ftp?tabs=portal.  
•  
Container deployment\: Azure App Service fully supports the deployment of containerized  
applications by providing built-in support for Docker. To learn more, check out https\://  
learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-ci-cd-custom-  
container.  
•  
Web Deployment via Visual Studio\: With this method, you directly publish your project to  
Azure App Service from within Visual Studio.  
In this exercise, we will use the Visual Studio deployment option. From within Visual Studio, you  
can create a new Azure App Service instance and upload directly to it, but we will create the required  
resources on Azure and then just use Visual Studio to publish.  
Make sure to have the BooksStore Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted version cloned  
on your machine to be able to proceed with this exercise. You can find the project in the following  
folder\: https\://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Blazor-WebAssembly/  
tree/main/Complete/AspNetCoreHosted.  
If you are following this book with your own project idea and a web API is not needed, you can still  
use the steps here to deploy the Blazor WebAssembly app to Azure App Service.  
Let’s get started with publishing the project\:  
1\. 2. Open the browser and navigate to the Azure portal via https\://portal.azure.com.  
On the home page, open the left menu and click on Create a resource\: Publishing Blazor WebAssembly to Azure App Service 313  
Figure 14.3 – Create a resource in the Azure portal  
3\. On the Create a resource page, choose the Web App service\:  
Figure 14.4 – The Web App Azure service  
4. On the Create Web App page, choose your subscription, create a new resource group with a  
unique name, define the name of your Azure App Service \(it must be unique globally\), choose  
Code as the Publish method, select .NET 7 for Runtime stack, select Windows for Operating  
System, choose an Azure region where the app will be hosted, and finally, for Pricing plan,  
make sure to choose Free F1 \(Shared Infrastructure\). The following screenshot shows the  
values I have used\: 314  
Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
Figure 14.5 – Create Web App form with the values I used  
5\. 6. Click on Review + create, then click Create again after the validation finishes.  
Wait until the Azure App Service resource is created. Once Azure finishes the deployment,  
you should see the following UI\: 7. Publishing Blazor WebAssembly to Azure App Service 315  
Figure 14.6 – Azure App Service is deployed  
Click on Go to resource to open the Azure App Service resource page of our project, and then  
click on Download publish profile\:  
Figure 14.7 – Download publish profile button  
Now, we can open the solution in Visual Studio and start deploying the project to the created  
Azure App Service. 316  
Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
8. Because the project is ASP.NET Core Hosted, we need only to deploy the server project, so  
right-click on the BooksStore.Server project and click on Publish…\:  
9\. 10. Figure 14.8 – The Publish... button for the server project  
In the Publish dialog, choose Import Profile and browse the downloaded profile from step 7.  
Now, the project is ready to be published. Just click the Publish button and Visual Studio will  
build the project in the Release mode and start the deployment.  
Figure 14.9 – Publish to Azure App Service profile  
Done! Once the app is built and published, the browser will automatically open and navigate to your new  
app. The URL of the app will be https\://\{AZURE\_APP\_SERVICE\_NAME\}.azurewebsites.  
net, so in our example, the URL of the app is https\://mastering-blazor-webassembly-  
book.azurewebsites.net.  
Congrats! You have published your first Blazor WebAssembly project. The feeling is amazing, but  
we are not done yet. We will discuss another interesting service called Azure Static Web Apps for  
publishing our Blazor WebAssembly standalone project. Publishing Blazor WebAssembly to Azure Static Web Apps 317  
# Publishing Blazor WebAssembly to Azure Static Web Apps  
Azure Static Web Apps is a recently introduced Azure resource that simplifies the building and  
deployment of static web apps. However, it’s important to note that it’s not suitable for publishing a  
Blazor WebAssembly ASP.NET Core Hosted app as it doesn’t provide a server that supports .NET.  
Instead, it’s designed to serve static web files and projects and is optimized for this type of application.  
One of its key benefits is its ability to distribute static files globally, enabling users to access an app  
quickly from the nearest geographic location.  
One of the great features of Azure Static Web Apps is its automatic CI and CD pipeline when using  
GitHub or Azure DevOps. This means that whenever you submit any code changes to the repository,  
the pipeline is triggered to build and deploy the updated code.  
Make sure that you have the latest version of the BooksStore project; you can clone it from the  
following URL\:  
https\://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Blazor-WebAssembly/  
tree/main/Chapter\_14/Final/  
Now, let’s deploy our Blazor WebAssembly project to a new instance of Azure Static Web Apps\:  
1\. Before we start publishing, we need to set the right URL for the API because, now that we are  
publishing the Blazor WebAssembly alone, we need to set the API URL used in HttpClient  
to the correct API. You can set the API link within the appsettings.json file inside the  
wwwroot folder of the Blazor project. To get the API link, you can either deploy the API project  
yourself the same way we deployed the Blazor project in the previous step or you can just set  
it to https\://mastering-blazor-webassembly-book.azurewebsites.net;  
I have published the API at this URL, so you can just use it as it is\:  
\{  
"ApiUrl"\: "https\://mastering-blazor-webassembly-  
book.azurewebsites.net"  
\}  
2\. 3. 4. Make sure to create a new GitHub repository, clone it, copy the project files to it, then push it,  
so the source code is available on GitHub. Or just navigate to the following GitHub repository  
and click on Fork\: https\://github.com/aksoftware98/mastering-blazor-  
webassembly-project.  
Navigate to the Azure portal via https\://portal.azure.com.  
From the left menu, click on Create a new resource. 318  
Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
5\. Search for azure static web apps, and then choose the Static Web App service\:  
6. Figure 14.10 – Creating a new Static Web App service in Azure  
On the Create Static Web App page, choose an existing resource or create a new one. Then,  
set the name of the resource, the Free plan type, and the region for the Azure Functions API,  
which we don’t have for our project, but the Static Web App asks for it nonetheless\: Publishing Blazor WebAssembly to Azure Static Web Apps 319  
Figure 14.11 – Create Static Web App details  
7\. 8. In Deployment details, choose GitHub, then click on Sign in with GitHub if you are asked to.  
For the GitHub details, choose your organization, then the Repository name, and the Branch  
name, as shown here for my GitHub account\: 320  
Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
9. Figure 14.12 – Deployment details of the Static Web App resource  
The last part we need to fill out is Build Details. Choose Blazor for Build Presets, then set App  
location to /src/BooksStore because this is the folder that contains the BooksStore  
Blazor project file. Leave the Api location field empty, and leave Output location as it is\:  
10\. 11. Figure 14.13 – Build Details of the Static Web App resource  
Click on Review + Create, then Create again after the validation is finished.  
Once the deployment is complete, click Go to resource so you can find the URL of the provisioned  
Azure Static Web App, and that’s the URL we will use to access our application\: Publishing Blazor WebAssembly to Azure Static Web Apps 321  
Figure 14.14 – The URL of the Azure Static Web App  
That’s it! The Azure Static Web App has modified your GitHub repository and created a GitHub Action  
workflow. This workflow will be triggered whenever you commit or merge a change to the main  
branch or the branch you defined during the creation of the Azure Static Web App.  
If you navigate to the GitHub repository for the BooksStore source code and open the Actions  
tab, you should see a workflow that has been created by the Azure Static Web App\:  
Figure 14.15 – GitHub Actions workflow created by the Azure Static Web App 322  
Publishing Blazor WebAssembly Apps  
With every change you submit to the main branch, the workflow will kick off to build and deploy  
the project automatically. In the Blazor WebAssembly prerelease final checks section, we talked about  
URL rewriting for Blazor WebAssembly standalone apps. So, the app should be working fine now, but  
if we try to navigate to BASE\_URL/counter, for example, directly from the browser, we should  
get a 404 not found page.  
To resolve this, we need to instruct the Azure Static Web App to fall back any URL to /index.  
html. To do that, we need to add a new JSON file to the BooksStore project root directory called  
staticwebapp.config.json and, inside it, add the following JSON content\:  
\{  
"navigationFallback"\: \{  
"rewrite"\: "/index.html"  
\}  
\}  
This file contains the configuration that the Azure Static Web Apps service uses to handle requests. If  
you try to access /book/form, you will get a not found page because there is nothing on the server  
that corresponds to /book/form. Because for the Blazor WebAssembly SPA, the web file on the  
server is index.html, which is the single page of the app, other files are just the assets such as CSS,  
JS files, and so on. The /book/form URL is only valid within the Blazor app when it is running  
inside the browser. So, the host should automatically redirect you to /index.html, where the app  
will load and then navigate to the desired page on the client side.  
If you commit this change now to the branch and navigate back to the Actions page of the GitHub  
repository, you will notice that the workflow has started to build and deploy the project again.  
Wait until the workflow turns green and the status indicates success, which means if we navigate to  
the URL we obtained in step 11, we should see this fancy application shining on the screen\: Summary 323  
Figure 14.16 – The final app up and running on Azure Static Web Apps  
Congratulations! You have built a full single-page application with Blazor WebAssembly, and you  
have learned how to build it securely and efficiently, how to test it, and more.  
# Summary  
As this chapter comes to an end, our learning journey with this book is done. In this chapter, we  
learned how Blazor WebAssembly prepares an app for publishing, the steps it takes during this process,  
and how to configure them if needed. Then, we introduced the Blazor WebAsssembly ASP.NET Core  
Hosted project type and template, and then we deployed an ASP.NET Core Hosted Blazor project to  
Azure App Service. Finally, we deployed the project that we worked on during this book to the Azure  
Static Web Apps service.

The journey of Mastering Blazor WebAssembly has come to an end. We have gone from explaining what  
Blazor WebAssembly is all the way to having an app running on Azure that is available for public access.  
We have covered all the main topics that you may need in your day-to-day work with Blazor, but that  
is not everything; Blazor still has a lot to offer and explore.  
This chapter will begin with a review of the additional components and functionalities that we have  
added to the book’s project to help you consolidate your learning and use it to create more components  
and features for real-world applications. After that, we will briefly explore some other possibilities

# Discovering more components and features in the book’s  
# project  
This book has covered basic and advanced topics of Blazor using the practical approach of developing  
features and components for the BooksStore project, which simulates a real-world scenario. In this  
section, I will present more components and features that have been added to the project’s repository,  
which will help you review what you have learned in this book and provide you with a useful resource  
that you can refer to when you encounter similar scenarios in your daily work.  
The three features I will cover in this section are registering a user, rating and reviewing a book, and  
finally, how the admin can upload a cover file. Let’s get started.  
User registration  
In Chapter 9, Authenticating and Authorizing Users in Blazor, in the Building JWT custom authentication  
flow section, we developed the authentication infrastructure and created a login page, but the users  
need to register too.  
If you run the project and navigate to /authentication/register, the page will look as follows\:  
Figure 15.1 – User registration page  
Here are the overall steps for building the register feature\:  
1. Build the register model that will carry the registration details of the user. The model named  
RegisterUserRequest, in the ASP.NET Core Hosted project, is in the BooksStore. Discovering more components and features in the book’s project 327  
2\. 3. Shared project, but for the standalone project, the model can be found in the Models folder  
of the BooksStore project.  
Write the method in AuthenticationService that will call the /authentication/  
register endpoint in the API to submit the registration details. In the ASP.NET Core Hosted  
and standalone projects, the logic can be found in IAuthenticationService.cs and  
AuthenticationService.cs in the Blazor WebAssembly project.  
Create a page called Register.razor in the Pages/Authentication folder in the  
Blazor WebAssembly project. This page contains the user registration form and the full logic  
of submitting the data to the API.  
Going over the steps and the files will help you practice a flow that’s common for any operation in  
Blazor WebAssembly apps, and our project now supports a user registration operation.  
Rating and reviewing  
When we select a book from the home page, we will be taken to a book details page that shows more  
information and lets the user add the book to their cart, buy it, and more. It would be helpful if the  
buyers could give a book a rating from one to five stars, and write a comment so other buyers can  
know how good this book is.  
In the BooksStore repository, I have added a Rating component and a BookRatingForm  
component to the BookDetails page, and the page now looks as follows\:  
Figure 15.2 – BookDetails with rating and review form 328  
What’s Next?  
That looks cool. The question is, how we can build this cute stars component and let the user submit  
a rating by clicking on any of the five stars?  
The stars rating component can be found in the Shared folder of the Blazor WebAssembly project  
in the Rating.razor file.  
I will explain briefly the logic of the Rating component, but first, we need to import the Font Awesome  
web font. Font Awesome provides scalable vector icons. We can use the icons and customize them  
using CSS. To bring Font Awesome into our project, we need to reference their CSS stylesheet in the  
index.html file of the Blazor project. You can download the CSS file or get an online reference via  
the following link\: https\://fontawesome.com/start.  
The component has a for loop that renders five \<i\> elements with the fa and fa-star classes  
from Font Awesome, so the output will be five stars. There are multiple classes in the styles of the  
components\: the CSS star class defines the size, the default color, and cursor pointer of the star; the  
CSS selected class sets the color of the star to gold; and the read-only class sets the cursor to  
default so the star doesn’t indicate that it’s clickable.  
The component takes three parameters\: StarCount of the int type, StarCountChanged of  
the EventCallback\<int\> type, and IsReadOnly of the bool type.  
Each \<i\> element has the @onclick event handler. When a click event occurs, we check whether  
IsReadOnly is set to true. If it is, then we just return from the method, but if it’s set to false, then  
we set StarCount to the number of the star that has been clicked and call the StarCountChanged  
EventCallback so the parent components can get the newly selected value from inside the Rating  
component. Each star builds a custom CSS classes list, so if the StarCount value is bigger than or  
equal to the star value, then we set the selected class to that star, and if IsReadOnly is set to  
true, then we append the read-only class to each star.  
The logic is simple and very beneficial as a rating component is needed in many real-world cases.  
Finally, to see how this component is being used in the full project, check out the BookRatingForm  
component in the Shared folder of the Blazor project, and the BookDetails page in the Pages/  
UserPage folder.  
Uploading cover images  
The last feature we will go over is uploading a cover file for the book. This feature is important because  
it allows you to upload files in Blazor WebAssembly.  
The upload file logic can be found in the Blazor project in two places\: the API call logic is in  
IBooksService and BooksHttpClientService is in the Services folder, and further  
logic can be found in the UploadBookCover.razor page in the Pages folder. Discovering more components and features in the book’s project 329  
Blazor WebAssembly provides the InputFile component out of the box. InputFile allows us to  
pick single or multiple files. Each returned file is of the IBrowserFile type. IBrowserFile contains  
all the metadata of the file, such as the name and size, and it also contains the OpenReadStream  
method, which we can use to open a Stream for the selected file.  
Now, let’s talk about how the upload book cover feature works in the BooksStore project.  
The project has a new page called Upload Book Cover that is accessible only by Admin users via /  
book/\{BOOK\_ID\}/upload-cover.  
If you log in as an admin and navigate to any book details, an Upload Cover button will appear at the  
top of the page that will redirect you to the Upload Book Cover page\:  
Figure 15.3 – Upload Book Cover page  
The page simply retrieves the full book details and renders a cover \(if one is available\) and provides  
the user with an InputFile component and an Upload button. 330  
What’s Next?  
The page has two methods. One is called OnChooseFile; this is assigned to the @onchange event  
of the InputFile component. It is triggered whenever the user chooses a file. OnChooseFile  
validates the extension of the file to make sure it’s a valid image file, then assigns the chosen file to a  
variable of the IBrowserFile type.  
The second method on the page is UploadCoverAsync; this method calls UploadBookCoverAsync  
inside the BooksHttpClientService method, which submits the file to the API.  
The logic of submitting a file to an API is unlike the API calls we have done so far. Basically, the  
content of the HTTP request should be MultipartFormDataContent instead of JSON. This  
HTTP content allows uploading binary files inside the HTTP request body.  
Inside BooksHttpClientService, there is the UploadBookCoverAsync method. This  
method receives a book ID as a parameter, a Stream object that represents the stream for the chosen  
file to be uploaded, and the filename\:  
public async Task UploadBookCoverAsync\(string bookId, Stream stream,  
string fileName\)  
\{  
using var content = new MultipartFormDataContent\(\);  
using var fileContent = new StreamContent\(stream\);  
fileContent.Headers.ContentDisposition = new  
ContentDispositionHeaderValue\("form-data"\)  
\{  
Name = "file",  
FileName = fileName  
\};  
content.Add\(fileContent\);  
var response = await \_httpClient.PostAsync  
\(\$"/books/\{bookId\}/cover", content\);  
if \(!response.IsSuccessStatusCode\)  
\{  
Var error = await response.Content  
.ReadFromJsonAsync\<ApiErrorResponse\>\(\);  
Console.WriteLine\(error\);  
\}  
\}  
In the first line in the method, we create the content object of the MultipartFormDataContent  
type and an object of the StreamContent type called fileContent, which will contain the  
Stream of the file. After that, we use the headers of fileContent to set the name of the file in  
the form, which is file in this example. Using Blazor WebAssembly for mobile and desktop development 331  
Those were the three main features I wanted to share with you. In conclusion, going over these three  
components and features helps you retrieve the knowledge and put the skills we have developed  
throughout this book into practice again and shows you more capabilities and possibilities in Blazor  
WebAssembly to get you ready to start building your own apps.  
With that, we can conclude the BooksStore project and all the Blazor WebAssembly topics. In  
the next sections, we will cover what else you can do with Blazor WebAssembly and provide some  
suggestions to get started with finding and implementing your first idea in Blazor WebAssembly.  
# Using Blazor WebAssembly for mobile and desktop  
# development  
The potential of Blazor WebAssembly is not limited only to the browser. With the power of .NET  
MAUI, you can develop apps that run on iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS and have access to the  
native capabilities of each device, such as storage, notifications, and camera.  
By taking advantage of the rich Blazor UI capabilities and the components ecosystem, you can easily  
develop beautiful apps with astonishing UIs.  
Check the Microsoft official documentation to get started\: https\://learn.microsoft.com/  
en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/tutorials/maui?view=aspnetcore-  
7.0&pivots=windows.  
# Building real-time applications with Blazor and SignalR  
SignalR is a real-time messaging framework that allows direct communication between the client and  
the server in both directions. With SignalR, the server can push content to the client instantly without  
the need for the client to request the data.  
SignalR can be easily used in Blazor apps, and it enriches projects with many features, such as  
notifications, chat, and pushing updates from one browser to the other as they happen in real time.  
You can also develop live dashboards with SignalR as you send the statistics and charts updates from  
the server to the client.  
To learn how to use SignalR in Blazor WebAssembly with the ASP.NET Core web API, check  
out the following URL\: https\://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/  
blazor/tutorials/signalr-blazor?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-  
studio&pivots=webassembly. 332

# Third-party UI components and packages  
Throughout this book, we have learned about wonderful third-party packages built by the community,  
such as bUnit and Blazored.LocalStorage.  
If you want to build advanced apps, developing your own components can be a bit costly. Luckily, there  
is a great set of wonderful UI component packages that provides you with a collection of components  
for all kinds of scenarios with a beautiful and customizable look.  
Here is a list of my favorite components that I use from time to time\:  
•  
MudBlazor\: This is definitely the most advanced and common UI package for Blazor. MudBlazor  
is an open source UI component library for Blazor applications. It provides a set of reusable  
and customizable components that are easy to integrate into your apps to build responsive and  
modern-looking software quickly. To learn more and get started with MudBlazor, check out  
their official website and documentation at https\://mudblazor.com.  
Figure 15.4 – MudBlazor official website Building your own app 333  
•  
Blazorise\: This is another UI component library for Blazor that provides a variety of different  
components with a modern look. To learn more and get started, visit https\://blazorise.  
com/.  
•  
Radzen Blazor Components\: This library contains a different set of components and is available  
at https\://blazor.radzen.com/.  
These three packages are fully open source and free to use, and they take the UI part away from you,  
so it’s easy to create a new project and focus on a high-quality app with nice logic and features.  
# Building your own app  
If you are reading this book and you are new to software development, then this is the right time to put  
all you have learned together in a real-world application. Go and discover the UI libraries mentioned  
in the previous section and create a new project.  
Are you struggling to come up with an idea for an app? The best way to start is to work on a real-world  
app that you or someone around you will use. If you are not yet ready to develop apps to be used by  
others, develop apps for yourself. Here is a list of good ideas for you to get started with\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Develop a time management app where you can track your work and study time  
Develop an expenses tracker app to track and manage all your expenses  
If any of your family or friends have a small business, consider developing an app to automate  
their work and track their accounting  
If you love racing, you can develop apps to extract insights about Formula 1 races using what  
you have learned and leverage an existing third-party API\: http\://ergast.com/mrd/  
Those are just a set of suggestions, but of course, you can go with your own or get many more insights  
using tools such as ChatGPT or Bing.  
# Summary  
In this, the final chapter of this book, we learned about creating some more features in the app we  
built. Those features will help you recap what we have learned and enable you to use the project we  
have built as a reference for your future work. You should by now know what else you can do with  
Blazor, such as mobile development with MAUI and real-time applications. In addition to some open  
source UI frameworks for Blazor that you can rely on while building your own apps, you also have  
some project ideas if you would like to do something cool on your own. 334  
What’s Next?  
With these topics covered, you should have gained the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A better understanding of the BooksStore project  
Knowledge of what else Blazor allows you to do, such as mobile development and more  
Knowledge of third-party packages and frameworks that accelerate your development  
Ideas to help you get started with building your first project  
That’s all! Congratulations on making it this far. I hope you enjoyed this journey as much as I did,  
and that you get the best out of it. Symbols
