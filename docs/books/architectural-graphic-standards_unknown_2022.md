# A NOTE FROM THE PUBLISHER  
Over the years, I have seen my fair share of battered editions of Architectural  
Graphic Standards \(AGS \) in architects’ offices; even in the pick-up trucks of  
construction contractors. As an amateur architect and an author who has  
written about architecture, I have my own treasured volumes. Why not? AGS  
is a classic and a testament to a long partnership between Wiley publishing  
and the American Institute of Architects. It may be one of the only profes-  
sional reference books to have its own history, beginning with Drafting  
Culture\: A Social History of Architectural Graphic Standards \(MIT Press,  
2008\), written by practicing architect, historian, and Professor of Architecture  
at Georgia Tech, George Barnett Johnston.  
We do not know why John Wiley \(1808–1891\), the son of our founder,  
chose to publish a book for architects and their customers, but he chose well.  
Andrew Jackson Downing’s Cottage Residences was published by Wiley &  
Putnam in 1842. An influential pattern book of houses, it was consulted  
across America by house builders and led to the widespread construction of  
residences in the picturesque “Carpenter Gothic” style. It is still in print  
today. With Downing’s book, John laid the foundation for an architecture list  
that included many reprints of the work of John Ruskin.  
The publication of the 12th edition is a defining moment in AGS ’s 84-year  
history. As we like to say in publishing, content is escaping the confines of a  
book. The precursor for this on AGS was the introduction of a CD in 1996 and  
an ebook in 2007. In this edition, however, AGS becomes completely digital  
with its content fully searchable online. There are, of course, those who still  
treasure a book or prefer both print on paper and digital. The new edition will  
also be available in book form.  
With this fully digital edition, our objective is to make an architect’s work life  
easier. We have deepened our definition of what it means to create a com-  
plete and trusted companion for architects in the office, on a worksite, or  
anywhere one pleases. I haven’t seen many architects climb a scaffold with  
an AGS under their arm, but I have seen many with handheld devices.  
As Wiley’s digital capabilities evolve, we want you, our customers, to  
find working with our content to be as effortless as possible. We understand  
this dramatic shift in the context of defining ourselves as a learning company  
devoted to the educational and professional needs of our customers from the  
beginning of their architectural education to the end of their professional  
careers. In premier undergraduate architecture programs with which I am  
familiar, students work collaboratively in digital environments foreshadowing  
the work environment at architectural firms where they will be employed.  
Even in small offices, collaboration in a digital environment is part of the  
work routine. In short, we at Wiley are ready to meet you, the architect,  
where, when, and how you work.  
We believe deeply in our mission to serve you; we are appreciative of  
your needs; and we will continue to connect with them as we redefine pub-  
lishing in a world reshaped by digital experiences.

# FUNCTIONAL PLANNING HUMAN FACTORS  
# HUMAN FACTORS  
Human factors information refers to the variables that affect  
human performance in the built environment, such as human  
physiology and human psychology. Data accumulated from the  
fields of engineering, biology, psychology, and anthropology are  
integrated in this multidisciplinary field. “Fit” describes a design  
that uses human factors information to create a stimulating but  
nonstressful environment for human use. Some areas of fit are  
physiological, psychological, sensual, and cultural.  
describe dimensional variation on anthropometric charts\: that is, the  
mean percentile \(50 percent\), the small extreme percentile \(2.5  
percent\), and the large extreme percentile \(97.5 percent\).  
“Ergonomics” is the application of human factors data to design. This  
term was coined by the U.S. army when it began to design machines  
to fit humans, rather than trying to find humans to fit machines.  
The field of anthropometrics provides information about the dimen-  
sion and functional capacity of the human body. “Static anthropomet-  
rics” measures the body at rest; “dynamic anthropometrics” mea-  
sures the body while performing activities defined as “work.”  
Dimensional variation occurs in anthropometric data because of the  
large range of diversity in the human population. To utilize anthropo-  
metric charts effectively, a designer must identify where a subject  
user group falls in relation to these variables. The factors that cause  
human variations are gender, age, ethnicity, and race. Patterns of  
growth affected by human culture cause variation in human measure  
as well. Percentiles that refer to the frequency of occurrence  
Human behavior is motivated by innate attributes such as the five  
senses and by learned cultural attributes. Each human has a  
unique innate capacity to gather sensual information. How that  
information is understood is determined by personal and cultural  
experience. “Proxemics” is the study of human behavior as it  
relates to learned cultural behavior. Human behavior is motivated  
by the innate nature of the animal, and this behavior is expressed  
and modified by each person’s learned culture and traditions.  
The five senses determine human comfort levels in the environ-  
ment and are a part of human factors studies.  
• Site\: Behavioral scientists agree that, for human beings, seeing  
is the most engaged sense for gathering information. Physical  
form is perceived when visual data is organized into patterns,  
and that data is integrated with memories and emotions. Visual  
form is perceived as having a context with boundaries. Visual  
form can be understood to be a dynamic system of directional  
lines of forces that are innate, kinetic, and independent of the  
representational content of a form. Once a form’s attributes  
have been perceived, humans tend to give the perceived form  
symbolic meaning. This meaning is cultural and personal, result-  
ing from associations and past experiences.  
• Touch\: Touch is essential to human development and growth.  
Texture is learned most completely through skin contact. Human  
skin is sensitive to temperature, pain, and pressure. Vision and  
touch are interwoven in sighted humans. Memory of tactile  
experiences allows humans to understand their environment  
through visual scanning.  
• Hearing\: Humans can use hearing to determine distances.  
Sound moves in concentric circles and in horizontal and vertical  
planes. The ear transmits these airborne vibrations to the brain  
where it is processed and assigned meaning. The ability to focus  
hearing is called “sensory gating.” The ability to gate sound  
varies and diminishes with aging.  
• Smell and taste\: Research about smell is difficult to conduct  
because human sensitivity to smell is highly variable over time and  
from person to person. A person’s sense of smell to an odor can  
fatigue quickly during exposure. Smell is defined in terms of com-  
monly perceived odors such as flowery, putrid, burned, resinous,  
and spicy. Taste and smell are closely related in human experience.

# UNIVERSAL AND ACCESSIBLE DESIGN  
“Universal design is a process that enables and empowers a  
diverse population by improving human performance, health and  
wellness, and social participation” \(Steinfeld and Maisel, 2012\).  
Proponents of universal design view it as an approach to good  
design, and they posit that by considering the full range of human  
ability across our lifetimes \(small/big, young/old, with varying  
abilities across every size and every stage of life\), designers can  
provide better environments for everyone. In short, “Universal  
design strives to make life easier, healthier, and friendlier for all  
people” \(Steinfeld and Maisel, 2012\). While universal design must  
also be accessible, it exceeds the minimum requirements of acces-  
sible design standards to provide optimum conditions for people  
with and without disabilities.  
Some equate universal design with accessible design; however,  
there are distinct differences. Accessible design is the design of a  
certain percentage of features to conform to technical require-  
ments as required by laws such as the Architectural Barriers Act  
\(ABA\), the Rehabilitation Act, the Fair Housing Amendments Act  
\(FHAA\), and the Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\). It does not  
guarantee inclusion for everyone, nor does it guarantee good  
design in a holistic sense.  
This section will explain the differences and relationship between  
these two very different approaches to design. One addresses the  
full range of human experience and abilities and the other derives  
from an accommodation model that has a narrower focus. The sec-  
tion will provide details on the basic minimum requirements for  
accessible design and offer suggestions on where designers  
should exceed the minimum to provide a more welcoming and  
inclusive environment for all people by addressing universal design  
goals.  
This section is divided into three subsections\:  
• Universal design\: This subsection will provide a background on  
the philosophy and goals of universal design and present four  
case studies of universal design in public buildings and housing.  
• Accessible design\: This subsection will discuss the legislative  
history and regulatory process of accessible design and intro-  
duce important federal laws such as the Americans with  
Disabilities Act \(ADA\), Fair Housing Amendments Act \(FHAA\),  
Architectural Barriers Act, and the Rehabilitation Act.  
• Technical criteria\: This subsection will provide detailed drawings  
for how to comply with key accessible design standards and  
provide suggestions on how to exceed those standards to exem-  
plify best practices in universal design.  
the few barrier free environments \(Barrier Free Environments ,  
Stroudsburg, PA\: Dowden, Hutchinson, and Ross, Inc., 1977\).  
Ron Mace would give the movement its name and its first definition  
in his book, Universal Design\: Barrier Free Environments for  
Everyone \(Los Angeles, CA\: Designers West, 1985\)\: “Universal  
design is the design of products and environments to be usable by  
all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for  
adaptation or specialized design.”  
In the 1990s, Mace worked with a group of fellow advocates and  
designers \(architects, product designers, engineers, and environ-  
mental design researchers\) to create the Principles of Universal  
Design, providing a conceptual framework for implementing uni-  
versal design as an essential part of good design. The authors of  
the Principles argued that there was a business case for wide-  
spread adoption of the concept—increasing markets through the  
design of more usable products and environments. This marked a  
significant shift away from the regulatory approach taken by codes  
and standards. The Principles included a set of design criteria  
focused primarily on issues of usability\: \(1\) equitable use, \(2\) flex-  
ibility in use, \(3\) simple and intuitive use, \(4\) perceptible informa-  
tion, \(5\) tolerance for error, \(6\) low physical effort, and \(7\) size and  
space for approach and use.  
While the Principles proved to be valuable to early adopters of  
universal design, proponents of the concept across the world rec-  
ognized that usability alone is not sufficient to encourage wide-  
spread adoption and to address design goals important to the  
broader population \(see Steinfeld and Maisel, 2012\). For example,  
more usable environments alone do not necessarily open opportu-  
nities for participation in society for people with disabilities,  
women, or minority groups. What good is a more usable school  
building to women if the schools do not provide enough security for  
their safe education? Additionally, a neighborhood design that does  
not support walking contributes to increased levels of obesity and  
further disability, regardless of how usable the buildings in a com-  
munity might be. In addition, the Principles did not provide any  
evidence base or benchmarking strategy for achievement. In order  
to encourage adoption by the broader professional community and  
public, the Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access  
\(IDeA Center\) at the University at Buffalo—State University of  
New York developed eight Goals of Universal Design to complement  
the Principles. Each of the eight goals represents specific outcome  
measures and corresponds to a knowledge base from research  
in fields including human performance, social participation, and  
wellness. The first four goals focus on human performance in the  
knowledge areas of anthropometry, biomechanics, perception, and  
cognition, while the last four goals address health and social par-  
ticipation outcomes.  
Accommodate a wide range of body sizes and abilities  
\(see Figure 1.7\).  
Keep demands within desirable limits of body function  
\(see Figure 1.8\).  
In addition to achieving the goals of body fit and personalization,  
this adjustable-height lavatory and vanity allows adults and chil-  
dren to comfortably reach the faucets and use the mirror.  
Architect Koning Eizenberg Architecture and the exhibit designers, Springboard Architecture Communication Design, turned a mundane  
hand dryer into something more at the Pittsburgh Children’s Museum. They took an object that is simple to use and clear in its utility,  
multiplied it, mounted it within multiple reach ranges, and transformed it into an experience.

Our bodies and minds are in a constant state of change across our  
lifetime. We are not static. We are also exceedingly diverse—  
young and old, small and big, fast and slow; we come in shades of  
many skin colors and with many different backgrounds, aspira-  
tions, and ways of life. Increasingly, we humans are gaining more  
control over our world, our bodies, and our minds. To design uni-  
versally is to design for improving the human experience of the  
built environment for all. It recognizes that the designed environ-  
ment can improve life experiences at the individual and societal  
level. Universal design is a manifestation of the increasing control  
we have over our world, through discovery and application of  
knowledge. In addition to being a philosophy that puts the needs of  
people first, universal design has a practical side as well. Universal  
design is a continual improvement process that seeks to achieve  
the best possible outcomes with the means available, recognizing  
that not every project and context has the resources available.  
Universal design is most successful when fully integrated within a  
project. As a design movement, it is the result of a meeting of  
minds between human-centered design approaches and the dis-  
ability rights movement. In the 1970s, architect Michael Bednar  
suggested that the value of “barrier free design,” the term used at  
the time to address the removal of design practices that discrimi-  
nated against people with disabilities, extends to all of us, not just

Ensure critical information for use is easily perceived.  
Methods of operation and use are intuitive, clear, and unambiguous.  
This intersection design has several features that improve aware-  
ness for all people. Curb ramps with return curbs guide pedestri-  
ans in the direction of the safe crossing zone. The detectable  
warnings let people know they are about to enter the street.  
Countdown timers, pictograms, and an audible beacon all let peo-  
ple know when it is safest to cross while high-contrast markings  
alert drivers to the presence of a crossing zone.  
This faucet follows the common conceptual model of having the  
cold lever on the right and hot on the left. The faucet is coded with  
color and pictograms to aid in understanding by children and non-  
English speakers\: blue snowflake for cold, red flame for hot.

Incorporate opportunities for choice and the expression of indi-  
vidual preferences.  
Kitchens are one room of the house requiring sufficient light for detailed tasks such as cutting vegetables. This kitchen has several levels  
of lighting to suit anyone’s preference or needs and adjust for different times of day and mood.  
“Accessible” is a design term first appearing in the 1950s, describ-  
ing elements of the physical environment that are usable by people  
with disabilities. Originally, the term described facilities that wheel-  
chair users would be able to access, but the term has evolved to  
include designs for a wider group of people with more diverse  
needs, such as people with hearing and vision limitations.  
Continuing advances in medicine and technology have changed the  
character of disability since the introduction of accessible design.  
The population with disabilities is now more diverse, with many  
more people who have severe disabilities able to live indepen-  
dently and participate in community life. New technologies for  
wheeled mobility, including power wheelchairs, scooters, and seat-  
ing and positioning systems, have increased the complexity of  
design for wheeled mobility. New building technologies, such as  
residential elevators, wheelchair lifts, and power-door operators,  
have made the provision of accessible facilities more practical and  
less expensive. Accessible design will continue to change as medi-  
cal advances and technologies continue to evolve.  
From an architect’s perspective, appropriate accessible design for  
public facilities and multifamily housing is different from custom  
design of residences or workplace accommodations for people  
with disabilities. Public accessibility standards establish general  
design specifications that broadly accommodate minimal needs.  
Design for a specific user in a private residential setting or work  
environment should address that user’s specific needs and involve  
much more interaction with the client to ensure the design accom-  
modates the person’s preferences. It is also likely that people with  
disabilities will appreciate universal design approaches because  
they improve function beyond minimum requirements and increase  
social participation and safety.  
Respect and reinforce cultural values and the social and environ-  
mental context.  
Lactation rooms are an increasingly common example of how to break down cultural barriers, allowing mothers to comfortably breastfeed  
or pump with privacy if desired.

Architects should become familiar with the federal legislative pro-  
cess and its terminology to help them understand the intent of  
laws, their requirements, and their continuing evolution. A “law” is  
an act of a legislative body. A “regulation” is developed by a regu-  
latory agency such as the Department of Justice or the Department  
of Housing and Urban Development. A regulation defines the spe-  
cific ways that a law is implemented. A “standard” is a stand-alone  
document, often used to implement a regulation. A “voluntary  
consensus standard” is developed by a standards organization  
such as the American National Standards Institute \(ANSI\) or the  
National Fire Protection Association \(NFPA\), which has rules gov-  
erning the process of standards development to ensure equity and  
fairness. A standard can be referenced by a model code, which can  
in turn be adopted by a regulatory agency. Standards can also be  
issued by standards setting agencies of the government and refer-  
enced in their own regulations. “Guidelines” are a general term  
that can refer to nonbinding design criteria or to the equivalent of  
standards. Guidelines are sometimes issued by one government  
agency and then adopted as standards by another. Laws can also  
incorporate standards by reference or even include their full text.  
At present, the laws, regulations, and standards governing the  
implementation of accessible design are highly complex; there-  
fore, architects must educate themselves, and stay abreast of  
current developments to ensure that they have a good grasp of the  
requirements. Further, it behooves the architect to research the  
applicable laws, regulations, and standards that apply to each  
specific building carefully. Federal laws such as the Americans with  
Disabilities Act \(ADA\) and Fair Housing Amendments Act \(FHAA\),  
have built-in penalties for architects whose work does not comply.  
Thus, there is an incentive for the architect to understand thor-  
oughly the legal requirements of accessible design regulations and  
their underpinnings. Guidance information such as technical assis-  
tance manuals and bulletins on interpretation are available on all  
the federal regulations, although it is not all collected in one place.  
In addition to the regulations themselves, additional information is  
available in the legislative history of each act and in the numerous  
documents issued during the “rule-making process.” Architects  
can monitor rule-making activities to anticipate new rules and  
avoid unpleasant surprises late in the design stages of projects.

Available information at the state and local level may be more dif-  
ficult to find but most state regulations are based on federal  
requirements or model codes. The architectural guidelines and  
standards for laws such as the ADA are periodically revised  
through the rule-making process. To understand the complex  
nature of accessible design laws, regulations, and standards,  
architects should first understand the legislative process and  
accessible design regulatory history.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Civil rights laws are the basis for accessible design requirements.  
Governing bodies such as the United States Congress, state legis-  
latures, and local governments enact laws to achieve a particular  
public policy objective; for instance, the right of people with dis-  
abilities to access and use public buildings. The legislation specifies  
the measures necessary to achieve the policy objective. The legis-  
lation might directly reference a particular standard or it might  
authorize a government agency to develop and maintain a guide-  
line or standard. The administrative process for implementing  
federal laws requires public notice in the Federal Register and a  
public comment period for any proposed new regulations or guide-  
lines. Federal standards become regulations when the Department  
of Justice incorporates them in the Code of Federal Regulations.  
States have similar processes and often have parallel legislation.  
Civil rights laws often include provisions for both facility design and  
operations. Provisions that address operations create legal  
responsibilities that are shared between facility designers and  
facility operators. Architects should carefully record programming  
decisions with implications for accessibility, since the intended use  
of a new space often establishes the specific accessibility require-  
ments that apply. For example, in the ADA, requirements for an  
employee workspace are different from those for a public space. If  
a facility operator changes the use of a space after the building is  
completed, compliance becomes the owner’s rather than the archi-  
tect’s responsibility. Architects should carefully evaluate an own-  
er’s project funding sources to determine which local, state, and/  
or federal accessibility requirements apply. It is important to do  
this prior to preliminary design because the requirements can  
affect some basic early design decisions.  
Accessibility regulations have two parts\: technical criteria and  
scoping requirements. Technical criteria are the specifications for  
how to achieve the policy objective; i.e., “what and how.” For  
example, to ensure people who use wheeled mobility devices can  
use a drinking fountain, there must be a knee clearance height of  
at least 27 in. Scoping is the extent to which the technical criteria  
must apply; i.e. “when and where.” The technical criteria may apply  
to all project elements or to only a fraction of the elements.  
Scoping criteria specify how many items of what type need to be  
accessible, for example, at least 50 percent of drinking fountains,  
or 100 percent of dwelling units. One level of complexity in current  
accessibility regulations is caused by the presence of scoping  
requirements in different sections of regulations. For example,  
there may be scoping provisions in a beginning section of the  
document, and there may be scoping provisions integrated with the  
technical criteria. Often there are exceptions and conditional  
options buried deep within the technical criteria of the documents  
that are difficult to find.  
Sometimes, scoping and technical criteria can be in two different  
documents. State and local governments often adopt a document  
developed by the International Code Council and the American  
National Standards Institute, the ICC/ANSI A117.1 Standard, to  
achieve their public policy objectives. Some may adopt it using a  
separate law while others incorporate it via reference in their  
building codes along with other fire and safety standards. The  
International Building Code \(IBC\) includes scoping provisions but  
adopts the A117.1 standard by reference for its technical provi-  
sions. Currently, ICC/ANSI A117.1 is the only consensus standard  
for accessible design in the United States. Since 1986, no versions  
of A117.1 have scoping criteria. The IBC model code and the state  
or local codes usually base their scoping criteria on federal regula-  
tions. The purpose of removing the scoping was to encourage  
adoption by states and promote uniformity; however, many states  
and some municipalities have modified the IBC scoping criteria and  
several states have their own independent accessibility “code”  
that differs substantially from the ICC/ANSI A117.1 standard.  
The federal government empowers its standard-setting agencies  
to develop their own standards and processes for implementing  
disability rights laws such as the ADA and FHAA; however, the U.S.  
Access Board, a small federal agency, is charged with developing  
accessibility guidelines for several federal laws. This creates a  
complex relationship between the Access Board’s guidelines, fed-  
eral regulations of different agencies, and the state and local  
building codes across the United States. Although many of the  
accessible design requirements in the civil rights laws and the  
codes are similar, there have been considerable differences, espe-  
cially since state and local rule-making, federal rule-making activi-  
ties, and the revision cycles of model standards and codes are not  
synchronized. Despite significant efforts to harmonize national  
model codes and ICC/ANSI A117.1 with the federal requirements,  
there are still differences.  
Due to this complexity, architects must be able to determine which  
laws, regulations, and standards apply to any project and which is  
more stringent for any particular element. To help reduce complex-  
ity, federal agencies identify “safe harbors,” which are regulations  
or standards the agency certifies to be substantially similar to their  
own standards, permitting their use as an alternative to the fed-  
eral regulations. However, federally specified safe harbors are  
sometimes older standards, already superseded by state or local  
regulations. Furthermore, unlike municipal officials, federal agen-  
cies do not issue building permits and typically do not inspect  
construction prior to occupancy unless they are funding a project.  
Civil rights law enforcement is a “complaint-based process.”  
Federal agencies may choose to act on a citizen complaint, or a  
complainant may elect to seek direct relief through federal courts.  
Legal decisions regarding such complaints gradually refine unclear  
rules but the policies embedded in those decisions are not orga-  
nized for designers to easy reference. Victims of discrimination  
under the Act can be awarded compensatory and/or punitive dam-  
ages. Courts can also order remediation in the form of renovations  
to buildings, to bring them into compliance. Retrofitting and other  
conditions of remediation are considerably more expensive than  
complying with the law in the first place when costs are minimal.  
There is no statute of limitations on compliance. Complaints may be  
filed at any time, and violations are often uncovered during the  
course of due diligence. The latter can affect the sale and sales  
price of a property. The responsibility for compliance rests with  
building owners, architects, contractors, and others involved in the  
design and construction of covered buildings.  
To add to the complexity, some of the regulations have not changed  
at all since they were issued while others have changed consider-  
ably. For example, while the ADA Standards were revised signifi-  
cantly in 2010, the FHAA Guidelines have not been changed since  
they were issued in 1991, the same year the original ADA  
Standards were issued. Some federal agencies still use “legacy”  
accessibility standards such as the Uniform Federal Accessibility  
Standards \(UFAS\) for some of their construction programs, and  
recent standards such as the 2010 ADA Standards for other pro-  
grams. When more than one program is used to fund a single  
project, the applicable standards can be quite difficult to ascertain.  
Further, the date of construction or application for a building permit  
can trigger different regulations and standards. When architects  
are hired to assess compliance with building codes, they need to  
know what regulations or standards were in force at the time the  
building was designed or constructed and what applies in the pres-  
ent. Architects should therefore monitor federal activities related  
to the type of buildings they design and be familiar with the legisla-  
tive history of different laws to ensure they are aware of the most  
current regulations, design standards, and interpretations.  
In the 1950s and 1960s, disabilities rights advocates organized and  
petitioned federal, state, and local governments to enact legisla-  
tion that would allow people with disabilities to have access to the  
same public institutions to which others have access.  
In 1961, ANSI published the first national standard for accessible  
design\: Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, \(A117.1\).  
Many states and local jurisdictions adopted ANSI A117.1 as their  
accessibility code, although they often modified selected standards  
to suit their communities. It quickly became the most widely used  
accessible design standard in the United States.  
In 1968, the Architectural Barriers Act \(ABA\) was the first federal  
legislation to require accessible design in facilities owned or  
leased by the federal government, or financed by certain agencies  
of the federal government. It empowered those agencies to  
develop standards for accessible design. The ANSI A117.1  
Standard was referenced by most of the agencies.  
In 1973, Congress passed the Rehabilitation Act to address the  
absence of federal accessibility standards for buildings construct-  
ed by entities receiving federal funds and the lack of an enforce-  
ment mechanism. This Act created the Architectural and  
Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \(Access Board\) to  
develop and issue minimum guidelines for design standards to be  
used by the four federal standard-setting agencies. The Act  
required any facility built with federal funds, or built by entities that  
receive federal funds \(such as public schools and government  
contractors\) to be accessible to people with disabilities.  
A consensus committee periodically revises ANSI A117.1 and in  
1980, they expanded it significantly to reflect new research and to  
include housing standards. By 1982, the Access Board published  
“Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design”  
based largely on this document.  
In 1984, the four standard-setting agencies \(General Services  
Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Housing  
and Urban Development, and U.S. Postal Service\) developed the  
Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards \(UFAS\) to comply with the  
ABA and the Rehabilitation Act. The 1980 ANSI A117.1 served as  
the basis for the requirements in UFAS but the agencies added  
additional scoping requirements and specific sections that apply to  
the types of buildings they construct and fund. The UFAS requires  
that at least 5 percent of the units in multifamily and single-family  
housing projects constructed with any financial assistance from  
the federal government be accessible to people with mobility  
impairments and 2 percent to be accessible to people with com-  
munication impairments.  
In 1988, Congress amended the Fair Housing Amendments Act  
\(FHAA\) to prohibit discriminating against individuals based on  
disability. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  
\(HUD\), which oversees the regulations related to Fair Housing,  
was given the responsibility of developing regulations for imple-  
menting the Act which are called the Fair Housing Accessibility  
Guidelines \(FHAG\). Architects need to be aware of HUD’s inter-  
pretation of this Act. The Fair Housing Act Design Manual is the  
authoritative source of information on interpretations of the FHA  
regulations. FHAG dwelling units are of a lower accessibility  
standard than previous dwelling unit requirements found in the  
UFAS and in many state building codes; however, the regulations  
apply to all units in high-rise buildings and ground floor units in  
walk-ups.  
In 1990, the President signed the Americans with Disabilities Act  
\(ADA\) into law. It was a landmark piece of legislation that prohib-  
ited discrimination based on disability in employment, state and  
local government, places of public accommodation, transportation,  
and telecommunications. It provided new civil rights protections  
for people with disabilities. New federal accessibility standards,  
the ADA Accessibility Guidelines \(ADAAG\), similar to the 1986 ANSI  
A117.1 Standards, were developed that addressed the design and  
operation of places of employment \(Title I\), state and local govern-  
ment facilities and programs \(Title II\), and privately owned public  
accommodations \(Title III\). The ADAAG did not include housing  
design requirements.  
The International Code Council \(ICC\) started administering the  
ANSI reorganized A117.1 Standard in 1998 and expanded it to  
include technical requirements for dwelling and sleeping units  
consistent with the requirements of the FHAG. These are known as  
“Type B” dwelling units. The original ICC/ANSI A117.1 and UFAS  
housing requirements, as amended, became known as “Type A.”

# FUNCTIONAL PLANNING UNIVERSAL AND ACCESSIBLE DESIGN  
In 2003, ICC/ANSI again expanded A117.1 to add “Accessible  
Units,” which have a higher level of accessibility than the Type A and  
B units, which are less accessible and have adaptability features. In  
2004, the Access Board harmonized their latest ADA-ABA Guidelines  
with the 2003 version of ICC/ANSI A117.1. Over the next few years,  
the federal agencies previously using UFAS began using these guide-  
lines to comply with the ABA and Rehabilitation Act.  
In 2009, ICC/ANSI A117.1 added a “Type C” unit designation that  
addresses basic accessibility to single-family homes and other  
units not covered by other legislation. This is the result of the  
“visitability” movement started in 1986 by an advocacy organiza-  
tion called Concrete Change, directed by Eleanor Smith. Visitability  
provides a basic level of access to all homes that supports short-  
term use by people with disabilities and reduces the cost necessary  
to adapt the dwelling further. Many states and municipalities man-  
date visitable housing but there is a lot of variability in the require-  
ments and scope of coverage. The Type C units provide a uniform  
set of guidelines for local and state adoption. A proposed federal  
law, the Inclusive Housing Design Act, would require visitability in  
all new housing receiving federal assistance, which could include  
any federal mortgage insurance. The details of Type C and visit-  
ability ordinances are not discussed here because it is a subject  
more appropriate for the Architectural Graphic Standards for  
Residential Construction.  
In 2010, the Department of Justice published new ADA Standards  
for Accessible Design based on the 2004 ADA-ABA guidelines. It  
includes guidance for residential dwelling units. In 2014, HUD  
began allowing use of the 2010 ADA Standards as an acceptable  
alternative to UFAS \(with certain exceptions found in the Federal  
Register at 79 FR 29671\). Designers may use UFAS for projects  
under the auspices of HUD if they choose, and must use UFAS  
where required by HUD’s exceptions.  
ICC/ANSI anticipates publication of a new edition of A117.1 in 2016.  
This version will have major changes to fundamental requirements  
such as clear floor space and turning space based on more recent  
research than the research underlying the current standards, which  
was conducted in the late 1970s. While it is too early to know when  
state, local, or federal entities will adopt the 2016 edition, architects  
should begin familiarizing themselves with the new requirements as  
they generally exceed current minimum requirements and provide  
accessibility for a greater number of people with disabilities.  
which laws and regulations apply. Project accessibility require-  
ments may be determined by answering the following questions\:  
• What type of building or structure will be built?  
• Who owns the facility?  
• Will some construction funds come from a government agency?  
• What other government funding will the project receive?  
• Who are the intended users of a space or component?  
The table lists the applicable standards for many types of projects.  
included a self-evaluation and listed the necessary changes. State  
and local governments should have implemented those transition  
plans by now. The plan can address inaccessible programs by alter-  
ing policies and procedures, by modifying physical structures, or by  
a combination of both strategies. Although not every habitable  
space in every existing building needs to be accessible, enough  
accessible spaces to ensure access to all programs are needed.  
For example, if a school has only one accessible science laboratory  
and it is not sufficient to accommodate all grade levels, another  
accessible laboratory may be needed.  
In new construction, all spaces need to be accessible, unless oth-  
erwise noted by the regulations.  
Architects practicing in the United States understandably may be  
overwhelmed by the long regulatory history of accessible design  
and the complex way in which it is implemented. The following table  
can help designers determine the appropriate accessible design  
standard to use for any given project. The first step is to determine  
The 2010 ADA Standards include design requirements for new  
facility construction, and for additions to and alterations of existing  
facilities that are owned, leased, or operated by both private enti-  
ties and state or local governments. However, design standards  
and management responsibilities differ between the two owner  
groups\: Title II for state and local governments and Title III for  
private entities. Title II includes the regulations at 28 CFR 35.151  
and Title III includes the regulations at 28 CFR 36 subpart D. Both  
include the 2004 ADA-ABA Guidelines at 36 CFR part 1191, appen-  
dices B and D. The DOJ published these requirements collectively  
as the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design.  
Under Title III, owners and operators of existing private facilities  
that serve the public have ADA construction responsibilities under  
what is called “readily achievable barrier removal.” Under Title II,  
local governments also have the additional responsibility of making  
all their new and existing programs accessible and are held to a  
higher standard. Meeting this ADA responsibility for municipal  
programs may sometimes require new construction or physical  
modifications to existing facilities. The ADA also prescribes  
employer responsibilities for changing their policies or modifying  
their facilities to accommodate employees with disabilities \(Title I\).  
Several ADA concepts affect the design requirements for any  
specific building, such as “path-of-travel” components for renova-  
tion projects and the “elevator exception” for small multistory  
buildings. It is imperative that architects familiarize themselves  
with these aspects of the law as well as with the design standards  
to help their clients fulfill their responsibilities.  
The concept of “program accessibility,” which is similar to Section  
504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act for Federal Programs, is a key  
component of Title II. The ADA requires state and local govern-  
ments to provide access to all their programs for people with dis-  
abilities. Local government program responsibility includes policies  
and operations as well as the built environment. To provide access  
to existing inaccessible programs, state and local governments  
were required to develop and implement a “transition plan” that

The FHAA covers new multifamily housing constructed by either pri-  
vate entities or local governments. Generally, the FHAA covers proj-  
ects with four or more total dwelling or sleeping units in one struc-  
ture that are built for sale or lease. This includes apartments and  
condominiums, as well as all types of congregate living arrange-  
ments such as dormitories, boarding houses, sorority and fraternity  
houses, group homes, assisted-living facilities, and nursing homes.  
Even condominiums that are individually designed are covered. The  
law applies to all units if the building has an elevator or only ground  
floor units if there is no elevator. Only the first floor of multistory  
units must comply with the law. Townhouses can be exempted  
because they are multistory units and do not contain an elevator but  
they must be constructed a certain way to be considered single-  
family units. Existing housing structures, remodeling, conversion, or  
reuse projects are not covered by FHAA. The law’s design standards  
include requirements for both individual dwelling units and common-  
use facilities such as lobbies, corridors, and parking.  
The Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines \(FHAG\) allow the exclu-  
sion of certain dwelling units because of site considerations such  
as steep topography and floodplains. The guidelines include site  
practicality tests for analyzing site constraints. Several major  
scoping issues such as multistory dwelling units and multiple  
ground-floor levels are discussed in the supplementary informa-  
tion included in the FHAG.  
The requirements are modest and do not constitute full accessibility,  
yet they address a growing demand from the aging population \(mar-  
ket\) for housing in which they can live more safely and for a longer  
period. To assist design professionals in meeting the requirements for  
compliance, HUD has developed training and published the Fair  
Housing Act Design Manual . Prior to project design, architects should  
carefully review this material as well as the guidelines themselves.  
The Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines have seven basic design  
requirements. Refer to the Technical Criteria section of this chapter  
for detailed information on how to comply with the seven design  
requirements\:  
1\. Accessible Building Entrance on an Accessible Route  
2\. Accessible Public and Common Areas  
3\. Usable Doors  
4\. Accessible Route Into and Through the Covered Unit  
5\. Light Switches, Electrical Outlets, Thermostats, and Other  
Environmental Controls in Accessible Locations  
6\. Reinforced Walls for Grab Bars  
7\. Usable Kitchens and Bathrooms  
HUD recognizes the following 10 safe harbors. When used with the  
Fair Housing Act, HUD’s regulations, and the Guidelines, compli-  
ance with any one of these will fulfill the Fair Housing Act’s access  
requirements\:

codes in addition to those listed above.  
b. There may be various combinations of the project descriptions above.  
For example, a private tenant in a government-funded building, or a  
federal program operating out of a privately owned building, such as a  
Social Security office in a mall.  
c. Certain buildings may be exempt from federal requirements such as  
religious facilities; however, exemptions may not apply if the organization  
receives government funding, such as for meals or childcare programs,  
or if they have tenants not covered by the exemption.  
d. Temporary facilities must meet the same federal standards as similar  
permanent facilities.

Other solutions and standards may be used only if they meet or

The ICC/ANSI A117.1 Standard only contains technical criteria  
so it must be used in conjunction with the scoping requirements  
found in the Act, the regulations, and guidelines or the IBC. It  
is generally advised to use the most recent safe harbors, as  
those are more likely to have greater consistency with state  
and local codes.  
Following the Fair Housing Act Guidelines is not the same as pro-  
viding full accessibility. These requirements, like the accessibility  
requirements for places of public accommodation, are minimum  
guidelines. Some states and local jurisdictions will require greater  
accommodations than the FHAG. Thus, architects may want to  
consider going further, for example meeting ICC/ANSI A117.1 Type  
A unit requirements in all units, and ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(Accessible  
Units\) requirements in at least 5 percent of each unit type.  
This figure represents the way in which technical criteria are  
dimensioned in this chapter.  
As discussed earlier, technical criteria are the design specifica-  
tions for achieving compliance with various laws. The scoping  
section of the applicable standard or building code will specify  
when, where, and how many elements need to conform to the  
technical criteria. Sometimes, the technical criteria change  
depending on scoping. This section will illustrate the typical techni-  
cal criteria as specified by ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(2009\) and will pro-  
vide some alternatives that would allow minimum compliance with  
certain laws such as the FHA. It will also illustrate best practices  
to exceed the minimum specifications. This section focuses primar-  
ily on design for wheeled mobility because their needs have the  
greatest effect on building design. There are many other require-  
ments not illustrated here.  
Floor surfaces of a clear floor space must have a slope no steeper than 1\:48. One full, unobstructed side of the clear floor space must  
adjoin or overlap an accessible route or adjoin another clear floor space.  
The drawings and illustrations presented herein combine the  
requirements for several standards and regulations and include  
best practices as well. A star identifies dimensions in illustrations  
that are best practices, typically exceeding the minimum dimen-  
sions. Illustrations without a star have no research evidence to  
support one dimension over another. The illustrations also note  
new requirements that have been approved for inclusion in the  
upcoming 2016 edition of ICC/ANSI A117.1, as of the time of this  
writing, although not finalized prior to publication of this book.  
Sometimes, the ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(2016\) dimension is also a best  
practice because it was adopted based on the latest research.  
Some illustrations may have multiple dimensions\: \(1\) best practice  
\(identified by star\), \(2\) ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(2009\) requirements \(no  
label\), and \(3\) requirements of other standards or future standards  
\(labeled accordingly\). As with any resource book, it is important to  
realize that the illustrations depict general compliance require-  
ments under typical conditions. Unless otherwise specified, the  
dimensional requirements in this section represent minimum and  
maximum requirements as specified by ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(2009\).  
Consult with applicable codes and standards for more detailed  
specifications.

“Building blocks” provide the design foundation for accessibility  
and universal design. Designing access for wheeled mobility users  
provides generous space clearances for all building users and  
makes the built environment feel spacious and comfortable for all  
people. Critical components of the building blocks include floor  
surfaces, maneuvering and turning space, knee and toe clearance,  
and functional reach distances. The building blocks are a set of  
rules that apply in similar ways across a variety of spaces and  
situations. Learning the building blocks is a critical step for all  
designers and architects toward creating inclusive and accessible  
spaces.

Designers have the option of using a T-shaped or circular turning  
space where a turning space is required.  
Knee and toe clearance that is included as part of a T-shaped turning space is allowed only at the base of the T, or on one arm of the T. In  
some configurations, the obstruction of part of the T-shape may make it impossible for a wheelchair user to maneuver to the desired loca-  
tion. ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(2016\) will require that knee and toe clearance included as part of a circular turning space overlap only 10 in. of  
the circular turning space. Floor surfaces of a turning space must have a slope that is no steeper than 1\:48 and has no level changes.

Existing elements may be located 54 in. maximum above the floor  
or ground. The 48-in. reach limit does not apply to tactile signs.  
Tactile signs must be installed so the tactile characters are  
between 48 and 60 in. above the floor. Below this height, tactile  
characters are difficult to read by standing people, as the hand  
must be bent awkwardly or turned over \(similar to reading upside  
down\) to read the message.

Accessible routes generally require the following\:  
• Site arrival points\: From each type of site arrival point \(public  
transportation stops, accessible parking spaces, passenger  
loading zones, and public streets or sidewalks\) to an accessible  
entrance.  
• Entrances\: Consult the applicable regulation to determine the  
required number of accessible entrances. Standards generally  
require that at least 60 percent of the public entrances, but no  
less than one, be accessible. The FHAG requires at least one, but  
may exempt some facilities from this requirement due to  
extreme site conditions. Consult the FHAG for site implacability  
tests; however, the prevailing attitude is that most sites can be  
made accessible.  
• Within a site\: Between accessible buildings, facilities, elements,  
and spaces on the site.  
• Interior routes\: Where an accessible route is required and the  
general circulation path is an interior route, the accessible route  
must also be an interior route.  
• Relation to circulation paths\: Accessible routes must coincide  
with or be located in the same area as a general circulation  
path. Avoid making the accessible route a “second-class” means  
of circulation. Consult the applicable regulations for additional  
specific requirements regarding location of accessible routes.  
• Directional signs\: Where the accessible route departs from the  
general circulation path and is not easily identifiable, directional  
signs should be provided as necessary to indicate the accessible  
route. The signs should be located so that a person does not  
need to backtrack.  
• Multilevel buildings and facilities\: Between all levels, including  
mezzanines, in multistory buildings, unless exempted.  
• Accessible spaces and elements\: An accessible route must con-  
nect all spaces and elements that are required to be accessible.  
• Toilet rooms and bathrooms\: The ADA and model codes gener-  
ally require that all toilet and bathing rooms be accessible. This  
does not trigger a requirement for accessible routes if the floor  
level is not otherwise required to have an accessible route.  
Follow these design guidelines for accessible curb ramps and  
passenger loading.  
• Design storm drainage utilities to shed water away from curb  
ramps.  
• The dimensions shown are for new construction. When these  
dimensions are impractical for alterations, refer to guidelines  
and standards.  
• Refer to applicable codes, standards, and regulations for detect-  
able warning requirements and locations. Some have unique  
requirements and others do not include requirements for these  
features.  
Accessible routes are only permitted to include the following  
elements\:  
• Walking surfaces with a slope of 1\:20 or less  
• Curb ramps  
• Ramps  
• Elevators  
• Platform \(wheelchair\) lifts \(The use of lifts in new construction  
is limited to locations where they are specifically permitted by  
the applicable regulations. Lifts are generally permitted to be  
used as part of an accessible route in alterations.\)  
Each component has specific technical criteria that must be applied  
for use as part of an accessible route. Consult the applicable code  
or regulation.  
If passenger loading zones are provided, at least one must be  
accessible or one accessible space for each 100 linear feet of pas-  
senger loading zone provided. An accessible passenger loading  
zone is also required where there is valet parking.  
The accessible passenger loading zone vehicle space must have an  
adjacent access aisle as long as the vehicle space. The access aisle  
must be marked, at the same level as the vehicle pull-up space, and  
adjoin an accessible route, including a curb ramp if the passenger  
loading zone is not level with the adjacent sidewalk. Curb ramps,  
signs, or other objects are not permitted in the access aisle.  
The vehicle pull-up space and access aisle must be level, with  
slopes no steeper than 1\:48. The accessible parking loading zone  
and the vehicular route to the entrance and exit serving it must  
have a vertical clearance of 9 ft-6 in., minimum.

Changes in level greater than 1/2 in. must be ramped. Some stan-  
dards prohibit changes in level in clear floor space, maneuvering  
clearances, wheelchair turning space, and access aisles.  
Wall sconces, fire extinguisher cabinets, drinking fountains, dis-  
play cases, signs, and suspended lighting fixtures are examples of  
protruding objects. Some standards allow doorstops and door  
closers 78 in. minimum above the floor. Protruding objects are not  
permitted to reduce the required width of an accessible route.

Protection from overhead hazards can be provided by built-in ele-  
ments such as planters or railings, or curbs. Designers can reduce  
or eliminate most overhead hazards \(e.g., low-headroom hazards  
can be avoided by enclosing areas under stairs and escalators\).

Use this where pedestrian route only crosses a vehicular way in  
one direction.  
Use this when there is insufficient sidewalk space for return curb

The information provided here conforms to the 2010 Americans  
with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible Design. State and  
local regulations may require greater access \(for example, some  
states require wider access aisles\).  
• The access aisles must be accessible from the passenger side  
of the vehicle. Backing into 90-degree stalls from a two-way  
aisle is an acceptable method of achieving this; but with angled  
parking, the aisle must be on the right side of the vehicle space.  
• Vehicular overhead clearance at a van-accessible stall, adjacent  
access aisle, and along the path of travel to and from a van-  
accessible stall should be 8 ft-2 in. In parking structures, van-  
accessible stalls may be grouped on a single level.  
• Access aisles must be clearly marked to prohibit parking and be  
the same length as the adjacent parking space. They also must  
be at the same level as parking stalls \(not above, at sidewalk  
height\). Required curb ramps cannot be located in access aisles.  
• Parking spaces and access aisles should be level, not exceeding  
1\:48 \(≈2 percent\) in any direction.  
• The stalls required for a specific facility may be relocated to  
another location if equivalent or greater accessibility in terms of  
distance, cost, and convenience is ensured.  
• Accessible stalls in the numbers shown in the accompanying  
table must be included in all parking facilities.  
• The access aisle must join an accessible route to the accessible  
entrance. As a best practice, designers should configure acces-  
sible routes to minimize wheelchair travel behind parked vehi-  
cles.  
• Signs with the International Symbol of Accessibility are required  
for accessible spaces. Signs must be mounted 5 ft. minimum  
from the ground surface to the bottom of the sign.  
• Accessible parking spaces must be on the shortest accessible  
route to the accessible building entrance. If there is more than  
one accessible entrance with adjacent parking, accessible park-  
ing must be dispersed and located near the accessible entranc-  
es. The accessible parking spaces must be located on the short-  
est route to an accessible pedestrian entrance in parking facili-  
ties that do not serve a particular building.  
• When different types of parking are provided \(for example,  
surface, carport, and garage spaces\), the accessible parking  
spaces must be dispersed among the various types.

serving visitors and patients must be accessible.  
2\. At rehabilitation facilities and outpatient physical therapy facilities,  
20 percent of the spaces provided for visitors and patients must be  
accessible.  
3\. The information in the table does not apply to valet parking facilities,  
but such facilities must have an accessible loading zone. One or more  
self-park, van-accessible stalls are recommended for patrons with  
specially equipped driving controls.  
4\. The requirements for residential facilities differ slightly among  
applicable codes and guidelines, but generally, one space must be  
provided for each residential dwelling unit required to be accessible.  
If more than one space is provided per unit, then 2 percent of the  
additional parking per unit is required to be accessible, in addition to  
visitor spaces as per the table. This parking must be dispersed  
among the various types of parking including surface, covered car-  
ports, and detached garages.

Landings should be level at top and bottom of ramp run and at least as wide as the run leading to it. A landing as shown is required where  
a ramp changes direction. Provide level maneuvering clearances for doors adjacent to landings. Note that required handrails and ramp  
edge protection are not shown in this drawing. All ramps must have edge protection and most building codes require a guardrail that does  
not allow passage of a 4-in sphere when the drop-off adjacent to any walking surface is greater than 30 in. This would include ramps,  
stairs, and landings.  
Handrails are required on both sides of ramps when rise is greater  
than 6 in. Provide continuous handrails at both sides of ramps and  
stairs and at the inside handrail of switchback or dogleg ramps and  
stairs. If handrails are not continuous at bottom, top, or landings,  
provide handrail extensions as shown in Figure 1.37. Ends of hand-  
rails must be rounded or returned smoothly to floor, wall, or post.  
Provide handrails of size and configuration shown and gripping  
surfaces uninterrupted by newel posts or other construction ele-  
ments. Handrails must not rotate within their fittings. Handrails and  
adjacent surfaces must be free from sharp or abrasive elements.

Model codes may allow or require elevators to serve as a means  
of egress in some circumstances when standby power is provided.  
Elevator doors must open and close automatically and have a  
reopening device that will stop and reopen the car and hoistway  
door if the door is obstructed. Although the device cannot require  
contact to activate, contact can occur before the door reverses  
direction. The device must remain effective for at least 20 seconds.  
Tactile designations at each jamb of hoistway doors should be 2 in.  
high, a maximum of 60 in. above the floor. A five-pointed star  
should be included at the main entry level.  
Hall call buttons should be raised or flush, 15 to 48 in. \(some stan-  
dards require 42 in. exact\) unobstructed above the floor measured  
to the centerline of the highest operable part, with the up button  
located above the down button.  
Audible hall signals should sound once for cars traveling in the up  
direction and twice for cars traveling down. Check the applicable  
regulations for required decibel level and frequency of audible  
signals. In-car signals are permitted in lieu of hall signals, as long  
as they meet all the requirements for visibility and timing.  
ASME A17.1, “Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators,” covers  
general elevator safety and operational requirements. It has been  
adopted in virtually all jurisdictions. All sizes shown in this section  
are based on ICC/ANSI A117.1, which contains extensive acces-  
sibility provisions for passenger elevators, destination-oriented  
elevator systems, limited-use/limited-application elevators, and  
private residence elevators. Consult the applicable accessibility  
regulations for elevator exceptions and requirements.  
Accessible Elevators\: A 5/8-in. tolerance is permitted at 36-in. elevator doors, allowing the use of standard 35.43-in. clear-width doors.  
Any other car configuration that provides a 36-in. door and either a 60-in. diameter or T-shaped wheelchair turning space within the car,  
with the door in the closed position, is permitted. Inside car dimensions are intended to allow an individual in a wheelchair to enter the  
car, access the controls, and exit.

Manual doors and doorways and manual gates on accessible  
routes must comply with accessibility requirements. With double-  
leaf doors and gates, at least one of the active leaves must comply.  
For a hinged door, the clear width is measured between the face of  
the door and the doorstop with the door open at a 90° angle. For a  
sliding or folding door, the clear width is measured between the  
edge of the door and the jamb with the door fully open. Hardware  
must be accessible with the door in fully open position. Openings  
and doorways without doors more than 24 in. in depth must have a  
clear width of 36 in. minimum. Doors in dwelling units covered by  
FHAG are permitted to have a “nominal” 32-in. clear width. HUD  
allows a 2 ft-10 in. with 31–5/8-in. clear width swing door to sat-  
isfy this requirement. ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(2003\) allows a 31–3/4-in.  
clear width in Type B dwelling units.  
Specify door hardware that can be operated with one hand, without  
tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. Thresholds are  
typically limited to 1/4 in. maximum height, or 1/2 in. maximum  
height if the top 1/4 in. is beveled at a 1\:2 maximum slope; how-  
ever, some standards allow a 3/4-in. height beveled at a 1\:2 maxi-  
mum slope for existing or altered thresholds and patio sliding  
doors in some residential dwelling units. Interior doors \(other than  
fire doors\) should be able to be operated with 5 lb. of force.  
Exterior doors and fire doors may be regulated by the authority  
having jurisdiction. Door closers must be adjusted so that there is  
at least a five-second interval from the time the door moves from  
90° to 12° open.

requirements for the bathrooms vary significantly among these  
Accessible design of toilet and bathing rooms is the most complex  
of any standard and code item. Fixture requirements vary among  
the common accessibility standards and guidelines. The Americans  
with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) Standards for Accessible Design provide  
accessibility requirements for general public buildings and accom-  
modations as well as residential dwelling units and units in tran-  
sient lodging, medical and long-term care facilities, and detention  
and correction facilities. The Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines  
\(FHAG\) include two options for bathroom design, designated as  
Option A and Option B. The primary difference is that Option B pro-  
vides a more accessible approach to the bathtub. In covered dwell-  
ings with two or more bathrooms, all bathrooms must comply with  
Option A, or at least one must comply with Option B requirements.  
In covered units with only one bathroom, either Option A or B may  
be used. Some residential facilities may be covered by both the ADA  
and the FHAA—for example, dormitories and nursing homes. HUD  
also permits the 2010 ADA to be used as an alternative standard  
\(with some exceptions\) for residential dwelling units formerly  
required to comply with UFAS by the ABA or Rehabilitation Act.  
ICC/ANSI A117.1 includes the technical requirements for four  
types of bathrooms with mobility features and the technical  
types\:  
• Accessible\: Bathrooms not in residential dwelling units or in acces-  
sible dwelling units generally have the strictest requirements.  
The number of accessible units required by the building code typi-  
cally is based on a percentage of the total number of units pro-  
vided in the facility.  
• Type A\: Type A dwelling units are required by the building code  
in multifamily residential facilities, including apartment build-  
ings, condominiums, monasteries, and convents. The number of  
units required to comply with these requirements is generally  
based on a percentage of the total number of units provided.  
Refer to the applicable building code.  
• Type B\: The requirements for Type B dwelling units are intended  
to be consistent with the technical requirements of the FHAG,  
although as of the date of this publication, the most recent ver-  
sion of ICC/ANSI A117.1 accepted by HUD as a safe harbor is  
the 2003 version.  
• Type C\: The requirements for Type C dwelling units are for cov-  
ered private single-family homes and generally only require  
first-floor access to a half-bath and Type B clearances at the  
toilet as well as reinforcement for the future installation of grab  
bars.

# FUNCTIONAL PLANNING UNIVERSAL AND ACCESSIBLE DESIGN  
Approach clearance requirements for the different accessibility  
standards are illustrated in this section. All dimensional criteria  
are based on ICC/ANSI A117.1 and adult anthropometrics. The  
differences among other standards are noted only where more  
stringent.  
maximum above the floor. Other mirrors must be mounted with the  
bottom edge of the reflecting surface 35 in. maximum above the  
floor.  
ICC/ANSI A117.1 allows wall-hung and stall-type urinals; it does  
not require an elongated urinal rim for a wall urinal; however,  
other regulations may. Manually operated flush controls must be  
located 44 in. maximum above the floor.  
The grab bar arrangement can influence the floor plan of an acces-  
sible bathroom. The grab bar requirements of ICC/ANSI A117.1  
\(Accessible and Type A\), UFAS, and ADA can become critical factors  
in toilet and bathroom arrangements. Figure 1.49 depicts typical  
grab bar positions at the toilet. The ADA, ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(Types  
A, B, and C\), and FHAG allow reinforcement for future installation  
of grab bars in residential dwelling units in lieu of pre-installed  
grab bars. ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(Types B and C\) and FHAG grab bar  
standards permit a 24-in. side grab bar if space does not allow a  
42-in. grab bar. ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(Types B and C\) and FHAG also  
allow the installation of swing-up grab bars in lieu of side- and  
rear-wall grab bars, so the wall adjacent to the toilet may be  
shorter or omitted entirely. Swing-up grab bars must be on both  
sides of the toilet, centered 15.75 in. from the toilet centerline.  
Generally, knee and toe clearance is required below accessible  
lavatories. The lavatory overflow is permitted to project into the  
knee clearance. All residential dwelling unit types require forward  
approach, with the exception of FHAG and ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(Type  
B and C units\), which allow a parallel approach centered on the  
basin, or removable cabinetry for a future forward approach. ICC/  
ANSI A117.1 \(Type A\) and ADA residential dwelling units also allow  
adaptable cabinetry beneath the lavatory provided it can be  
removed without removing or replacing the lavatory and the floor-  
ing and walls already have a finished appearance.  
ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(Accessible Units\) requires vanity size and prox-  
imity to the lavatory to be comparable to the nonaccessible units in  
a project.  
ADA, ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(except Type B and C units\), and UFAS  
include requirements for faucets, mirror height, and pipe protec-  
tion. All pipes located beneath these lavatories must be insulated  
or otherwise protected to prevent users from contact with the  
pipes. Lavatory controls should be within accessible reach range,  
be operable with one hand, and not require tight grasping, pinch-  
ing, or twisting of the wrist. Automatic controls are acceptable.  
Manually activated, self-closing faucets should operate for not less  
than 10 seconds.  
Mirrors located above lavatories, sinks, and vanities must be  
mounted with the bottom edge of the reflecting surface 40 in.  
Generally, no other fixture is permitted in the toilet clear floor space  
and the toilet must be located adjacent to a side wall to accommo-  
date grab bars. In residential dwelling units, UFAS, ICC/ANSI  
A117.1 \(Types A, B, and C\), FHAG, and ADA allow a lavatory within  
this space. The toilet is not required to be adjacent to a side wall,  
but if it is not, it must have 18 in. minimum clearance on both sides  
to accommodate the future installation of swing-up or floor-mount-  
ed grab bars. Toilet distance to side wall varies by standard. Refer  
to Figure 1.49 for dimensional requirements of each standard.  
In addition to clearance requirements, UFAS, ICC/ANSI A117.1,  
and the ADA include provisions for toilet seat height. Seats must  
not spring to return to a lifted position. They also specify the loca-  
tion and operation of flush controls and toilet paper dispensers.  
Manually operated flush controls must be located on the open side  
of the toilet; they may not be centered above the toilet. ICC/ANSI  
A117.1 \(Type A\) requirements also include seat height require-  
ments and the location and operation of flush controls. The hatched  
area in Figure 1.49 indicates the allowable location of the toilet  
paper dispenser. Dispenser outlets must be within the range  
shown. Dispensers should allow continuous paper flow, not control  
delivery.  
Where toilet compartments are provided, at least one compart-  
ment must be wheelchair-accessible. Where six or more toilet  
compartments are provided in a toilet room, in addition to the  
wheelchair-accessible compartment, a 36-in.-wide ambulatory  
accessible compartment is also required. Left- or right-handed  
configurations are acceptable. The door to the toilet compartment  
must be self-closing and have an accessible pull on both sides  
near the latch. The locking mechanism must be operable with one  
hand, and not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the  
wrist.  
Minimum compartment size varies based on presence of toe clear-  
ance under the partition wall, toilet mount \(side or wall\), and if the  
stall is for adults, children, or if it is an ambulatory stall. Use the  
accompanying figure and table to determine the appropriate mini-  
mum stall size.  
Sinks and lavatories for children ages 6 to 12 with a 31-in. maximum rim or counter surface may have a knee clearance of 24 in. minimum. Parallel approach is permitted at lavatories and sinks used primarily  
by children ages 5 and younger.

In new construction, all public and common-use toilet rooms are  
generally required to be accessible. In accessible toilet rooms, at  
least one of each type of fixture and accessory provided must be  
accessible. A wheelchair turning space is required within accessi-  
ble toilet rooms. Doors are not permitted to swing into the required  
clear floor space at any fixture, except in single-user rooms where  
a clear floor space is provided beyond the swing of the door. UFAS  
does not provide this exception in single-user rooms. The same is  
true of single-user bathing rooms, which will be discussed later in  
this section.  
Recent model codes require accessible single-user toilet rooms  
in certain assembly and mercantile occupancies. Single-user  
rooms are typically unisex facilities, which is beneficial for par-  
ents with small children and for people with disabilities who  
require personal assistance in using toilet facilities, as the assis-  
tant may be a person of the opposite sex. A requirement for  
unisex facilities usually applies when a total of six or more toilets  
\(or toilets and urinals\) are provided in the facility or in certain  
occupancy areas. Unisex facilities must be located within 500 ft.  
and within one floor of separate-sex facilities. In facilities with  
security checkpoints, such as airport terminals, unisex facilities  
must be located on the same side of the checkpoint as the sepa-  
rate-sex facilities.  
Where multiple single-user toilet rooms are clustered in a  
single location and each serves the same population, 5 percent,  
but not less than one of the rooms must be accessible. Signs  
must identify the accessible room\(s\), when not all rooms are  
accessible.  
Single-user toilet rooms provided within a private office are per-  
mitted to be adaptable for future accessibility. Making the room  
accessible is permitted to involve replacement of the toilet and  
lavatory, changing the swing of the door, and installing grab bars in  
previously reinforced walls. Certain conditions permit accessible  
unisex toilet rooms in alterations in lieu of altering existing sepa-  
rate-sex facilities, provided they are located in the same area and  
on the same floor as the existing inaccessible facilities. Consult  
with applicable standards and codes.  
Doors to single-user toilet rooms must have an accessible locking  
mechanism inside the room. Single-user toilet rooms require a  
single toilet and lavatory with an optional urinal. Fixtures provided  
in single-user rooms are permitted to be included in the number of  
required plumbing fixtures.  
If storage is provided in separate-sex facilities, it must also be  
provided in a unisex facility. Likewise, when bathing fixtures are  
provided in separate-sex facilities, an accessible shower or bath-  
tub must be provided in the unisex bathing room. Refer to the sin-  
gle-user bathing room section for more details.

The requirements of single-user toilet rooms also apply to single-  
user bathrooms. The accompanying figure depicts several layout  
options based on the minimum clear floor space for the fixtures,  
grab bar position, and door location. Each bathroom plan must  
provide the fixture clearances required by the applicable standard.  
In addition, maneuvering space must be provided, although the  
amount of space varies by unit type.  
ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(Accessible and Type A units\), UFAS, and the ADA  
require either a circular or a T-shaped wheelchair turning area  
within the room. Turning space can generally include knee and toe  
space under fixtures and accessories, as far as the building blocks  
section permits. The door swing may overlap the turning space. The  
clear floor space at a fixture is frequently more stringent than the  
turning space. With the exception of UFAS, the door swing may  
overlap the clear floor space at fixtures, provided there is enough  
clear space to position a wheelchair clear of the door swing. Door  
maneuvering clearances must also be considered.  
Bathrooms in ICC/ANSI A117.1 \(Type B units\) and FHAG must be  
“usable” rather than “accessible”; therefore, the minimum  
maneuvering clearance required is smaller. In these units, there  
must be enough clear space to position a wheelchair clear of the  
door swing and a turning space is not required. All of the standards  
permit required floor space for fixtures to overlap with the  
required maneuvering space.  
Note the accompanying figure does not depict each fixture’s clear  
floor space. Refer to the section on each fixture for specific dimen-  
sions. Dimensions provided refer to finish dimensions and do not  
provide a tolerance. Consider adding at least 2 in. to the overall  
size to allow for adjustments in the field. Doors in the figure are  
assumed to be 36 in. wide. Refer to the doors section for more  
detailed requirements.

The spacing and location of plumbing fixtures and toilet rooms  
should respond to occupant needs and code requirements. The  
design professional should be aware of how water is piped to  
plumbing fixtures and how waste is plumbed from fixtures, along  
with general venting requirements. Even during preliminary design,  
the design team should begin to address the requirements for accu-  
mulation and flow of water through horizontal and vertical piping.  
Additional design issues needing to be considered include coordina-  
tion of plumbing fixture location with toilet compartments and urinal  
screens, toilet and bath accessories, and tub and shower doors.  
the components they comprise. Requirements for plumbing system  
design should be based on the adopted code of the jurisdiction of  
the project.  
The word “approved” is often used in conjunction with components  
and devices that come in contact with potable water and products  
used for human consumption or use. Nonetheless, a responsible  
code official or agency must examine and test these items to  
determine whether they are suitable for a particular intended use.  
Only materials and devices approved by the local jurisdiction can  
be used in plumbing systems. Plumbing design drawings and utility  
services also must be examined and found to be in compliance with  
local codes, rules, and regulations.  
Plumbing codes establish minimum acceptable standards for the  
design and installation of plumbing systems and the selection of

To visualize the thermal impacts on differently exposed surfaces  
four distinct geographical locations approximately at the 24°, 32°,  
40°, and 44° latitudes are shown in Figure 2.1. The forces are  
indicated on average, clear winter and summer days. The air  
temperature variation is indicated by the outside concentric cir-  
cles. Each additional line represents a 2°F difference from the  
lowest daily temperature. The direction of the impact is indicated  
according to the sun’s path as temperatures occur. \(Note the low  
temperatures at the east side, and the high temperatures on west-  
facing surfaces.\) The total \(direct and diffuse\) radiation impact on  
the each side of the building is indicated with arrows. Each arrow  
represents 250 Btu/sq. ft. day radiation. Figure expresses the  
radiation in numerical values. The values show that in the upper  
latitudes, the south side of a building receives nearly twice as  
much radiation in winter as in summer. This effect is even more  
pronounced at the lower latitudes, where the ratio is about one to  
four. Also, in the upper latitudes, the east and west sides receive  
about 2–1/2 times more radiation in summer than in winter. This  
ratio is not as large in the lower latitudes; but it is noteworthy that  
in summer these sides receive two to three times as much radia-  
tion as the south elevation. In the summer, the west exposure is  
more disadvantageous than the east exposure, as the afternoon  
high temperatures combine with the radiation effects. In all lati-  
tudes the north side receives only a small amount of radiation, and  
this comes mainly in the summer. In the low latitudes, in the sum-  
mer, the north side receives nearly twice the impact of the south  
side. The amount of radiation received on a horizontal roof surface  
exceeds all other sides.  
The optimum orientation will lie near the south; however, it will  
differ in the various regions, and will depend on the daily tempera-  
ture distribution.  
In all regions an orientation eastward from south gives a better  
yearly performance and a more equal daily heat distribution.  
Westerly directions perform more poorly with unbalanced heat  
impacts.

The sun is located at one focus of the Earth’s orbit, and we are only  
91.4 million miles away from the sun in late December and early  
January, while the Earth-sun distance on July 1 is about 94.4 mil-  
lion miles.  
Solar energy approaches the Earth as electromagnetic radiation at  
wavelengths between 0.25 and 5.0 μm. The intensity of the incom-  
ing solar irradiance on a surface normal to the sun’s rays beyond  
the Earth’s atmosphere, at the average Earth-sun distance, is  
designated as the solar constant, Isc. Although the value of Isc has  
not yet been precisely determined by verified measurements made  
in outer space, the most widely used value is 429.2 Btu/sq. ft. hr.  
and the current ASHRAE values are based on this estimate. More  
recent measurements made at extremely high altitudes indicate  
that Isc is probably close to 433.6 Btu/sq. ft. hr. The unit of radia-  
tion that is widely used by meteorologists is the langley \(Ly\),  
equivalent to one k cal/sq. cm. To convert from langleys/day to  
Btu/sq. ft. day, multiply Ly/day by 3.67.

should be done from the compass north to find true north.  
Figure 2.5 provides an example for locating true north at a project  
site in Wichita, Kansas, through orientation correction.  
The climatic factors such as wind, solar radiation, and air tem-  
perature play the most eminent role in orientation. The position of  
a structure in northern latitudes, where the air temperature is  
generally cool, should be oriented to receive the maximum amount  
of sunshine without wind exposure. In southerly latitudes, how-  
ever, the opposite will be desirable; the building should be turned  
on its axis to avoid the sun’s unwanted radiation and to face the  
cooling breeze instead.  
Adaptation for wind orientation is not of great importance in low  
buildings, where the use of windbreaks and the arrangement of  
openings in the high and low pressure areas can help to amelio-  
rate the airflow situation. However, for high buildings, where the  
surrounding terrain has little effect on the upper stories, careful  
consideration has to be given to wind orientation.  
Find the compass orientation on the site.  
Locate Wichita on the isogonic chart. The nearest com-  
pass variation is the 10°E line.  
Adjust the orientation correction to true north.  
The figures illustrate a building that lies 25° east with its axis from  
the compass orientation.

# SOLAR PATH AND SOLAR ANGLE  
The position of the sun in relation to specific geographic locations,  
seasons, and times of day can be determined by several methods.  
Model measurements, by means of solar machines or shade dials,  
have the advantage of direct visual observations. Tabulation and  
calculated methods have the advantage of exactness. However,  
graphic projection methods are usually preferred by design profes-  
sionals, as they are easily understood and can be correlated to  
both radiant energy and shading calculations.  
At the Earth’s surface the amount of solar radiation received and  
the resulting atmospheric temperature vary widely, primarily  
because of the daily rotation of the Earth and the fact that the  
rotational axis is tilted at an angle of 23.45° with respect to the  
orbital plane. This tilt causes the changing seasons with their vary-  
ing lengths of daylight and darkness. The angle between the Earth-  
sun line and the orbital plane, called the solar declination, d, varies  
throughout the year, as shown in Figure 2.9 for the 21st day of each  
month.  
Very minor changes in the declination occur from year to year, and  
when more precise values are needed, the almanac for the year in  
question should be consulted.  
The Earth’s annual orbit about the sun is slightly elliptical, and  
so the Earth-sun distance is slightly greater in summer than in  
winter. The time required for each annual orbit is actually 365.242  
days rather than the 365 days shown by the calendar, and this is  
corrected by adding a 29th day to February for each year \(except  
century years\) that is evenly divisible by 4.  
To an observer standing on a particular spot on the Earth’s surface,  
with a specified longitude and latitude it is the sun that appears to  
move around the Earth in a regular daily pattern. Actually it is the  
Earth’s rotation that causes the sun’s apparent motion. The posi-  
tion of the sun can be defined in terms of its altitude β above the  
horizon \(angle HOQ\) and its azimuth ø, measured as angle HOS in  
the horizontal plane.  
At solar noon, the sun is, by definition, exactly on the meridian that  
contains the south-north line, and consequently the solar azimuth  
ø is 0.0°. The noon altitude β is\: 90° – L + δ.  
Because the Earth’s daily rotation and its annual orbit around the  
sun are regular and predictable, the solar altitude and azimuth may  
be readily calculated for any desired time of day as soon as the  
latitude, longitude, and date \(declination\) are specified.  
A practical graphic projection is the solar path diagram method.  
Such diagrams depict the path of the sun within the sky vault as  
projected onto a horizontal plane, as shown in Figures 2.10 through  
2.15\. The horizon is represented as a circle with the observation  
point in the center. The sun’s position at any date and hour can be  
determined from the diagram in terms of its altitude \(β\) and azi-  
muth \(ø\). The graphs are constructed in equidistant projection. The  
altitude angles are represented at 10° intervals by equally spaced  
concentric circles; they range from 0° at the outer circle \(horizon\)  
to 90° at the center point. These intervals are graduated along the  
south meridian. Azimuth is represented at 10° intervals by equally  
spaced radii; they range from 0° at the south meridian to 180° at  
the north meridian. These intervals are graduated along the periph-  
ery. The solar bearing will be to the east during morning hours, and  
to the west during afternoon hours.

The Earth’s axis is inclined 23°27′ to its orbit around the sun and  
rotates 15° hourly. Thus, from all points on the Earth, the sun  
appears to move across the sky vault on various parallel circular  
paths with maximum declinations of ±23°27′. The declination of  
the sun’s path changes in a cycle between the extremes of the  
summer solstice and winter solstice. Thus the sun follows the same  
path on two corresponding dates each year. Due to irregularities  
between the calendar year and the astronomical data, here a uni-  
fied calibration is adapted. The differences, as they do not exceed  
41′, are negligible for architectural purposes.  
The elliptical curves in the diagrams represent the horizontal pro-  
jections of the sun’s path. They are given on the 21st day of each  
month. Roman numerals designate the months. A cross-grid of  
curves graduate the hours indicated in Arabic numerals. Figures  
2.10 through 2.15 show eight solar path diagrams at 4° intervals  
from 28°N to 48°N latitude.  
Read the altitude on the concentric circles \(32°\) and the  
azimuth along the outer circle \(35°30′W\).  
The solar position to any location and time can be accurately cal-  
culated by relating the spherical triangle formed by the observer’s  
celestial meridian, the meridian of the sun, and the great circle  
passing through zenith and the sun. The following formulas can be  
used to find the solar altitude and azimuth angles\:  
sin β = cos L cos δ cos H + sin L sin δ  
cos ϕ = \(sin β sin L – sin δ\)/\(cos β cos L\)

β = solar altitude above the horizon  
L = latitude of the location; conventionally negative for  
southern hemisphere latitudes  
δ = declination of the sun at the desired date, which is the  
angle between the Earth-sun line and the equatorial  
plane \(north declinations are conventionally positive;  
south declinations negative\)  
H = hour angle of the sun = 0.25 × \(number of minutes  
from local solar noon\); H is zero at solar noon and  
changes 15 degrees per hour  
ϕ = solar azimuth, which is the angular distance measured  
from the south between the south-north line and  
the projection of the Earth-sun line in the horizontal  
plane  
The direction of the Earth-sun line OQ is defined by the solar alti-  
tude A \(angle HOQ\) and the solar azimuth B \(angle HOS\). These can  
be calculated when the location \(latitude\), date \(declination\), and  
time of day \(hour angle\) are known. The surface azimuth S is the  
angle SOP between the south-north line SON and the normal to the  
surface OP. The surface-solar azimuth G is the angle HOP.  
The angle of incidence q depends on the orientation and tilt of the  
irradiated surface. For a horizontal surface, qH is the angle QOV  
between the Earth-sun line OQ and the vertical line OV. In Figure  
2.17, the vertical surface shown as facing SSE, the angle of inci-  
dence qv is the angle QOP between the Earth-sun line OQ and the  
normal to the surface, OP. For surfaces such as solar collectors,  
which are generally tilted at some angle T upward from the hori-  
zontal, the incident angle qt may be found from the equation\:  
cos θt = cos A cos S sin T + sin A cos T

# ENVIRONMENT CLIMATE ZONE  
It is necessary to know the amount of solar energy falling on  
exposed surfaces in order to evaluate the importance of solar shad-  
ing. Because shading devices primarily protect surfaces from direct  
solar irradiation, only these energy calculations are described here.  
The magnitude of direct solar irradiation is, first of all, a function  
of the sun’s altitude and the apparent solar constant and atmo-  
spheric extinction coefficient. The latter two parameters take into  
account the annual variation of the Earth-sun distance and the  
atmospheric water vapor content. The intensity of direct solar  
irradiation under clear atmospheric conditions at normal incidence  
can be calculated by\:  
IDN = A exp \(–B/sin β\)  
where\:  
# β  
5 33 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 106 156 189 212 229 251 264 272 277 280 281 55 142 195 228 250 266 286 298 306 310 313 314 77

The direct irradiation received by any given surface is also a func-  
tion of the angle of incidence of the solar beam relative to that  
surface. The angle of incidence is the angle between the direct  
solar rays and a line normal to the irradiated surface.  
For horizontal surfaces, the cosine of the angle of incidence is  
equal to the sine of the solar altitude. The direct irradiation on  
horizontal surfaces is thus calculated by\:  
IDH = IDN × sin β  
For vertical surfaces, the incident angle depends on the solar alti-  
tude and the surface-solar azimuth. The surface-solar azimuth \(g\)  
is the angular distance between the solar azimuth and the azimuth  
of the surface. The surface azimuth is the angle between south and  
the normal to the surface, measured counterclockwise from south.  
The direct irradiation on vertical surfaces can thus be calculated by\:  
IDV = IDN × cos β cos γ  
IDN = direct normal solar intensity at the Earth’s surface on  
clear days  
exp = base of natural logarithms  
A = apparent solar constant or apparent normal incidence  
intensity at air mass zero  
B = atmospheric extinction coefficient  
Figure 2.18 indicates direct normal solar irradiation on clear  
days as a function of solar altitude on the solstices and the  
equinoxes.  
# CLIMATE ZONE  
Cold and underheated climate conditions occur over the northern  
half of the United States and in mountainous regions. These condi-  
tions can be generally quantified as where the frost depth is 12 in.  
or greater. Designing foundations for these conditions is treated in  
a more typical manner, such as\: providing a foundation below the  
frost depth, including a basement, and providing insulation on the  
exterior to reduce the cold ground temperatures from reaching the  
structure.

Detrimental frost action in soils is obviously limited to those areas  
of the United States where subfreezing temperatures occur on a  
regular basis and for extended periods of time. “Frost action,” as  
used in this context, is the lateral or vertical movement of structures  
supported on or in the soil. Frozen soil is, in itself, not necessarily  
detrimental to the supported structures. It becomes detrimental  
when, through the growth of ice lenses, the soil, and whatever is  
resting on the soil above the ice lenses, heaves upward. This causes  
foundations and the structures supported by the foundations to  
distort and suffer distress. Other common problems are the heaving  
of sidewalks, pavements, steps, retaining walls, fence poles, and  
architectural features.  
The depth of frost penetration is directly related to the intensity  
and duration of the freezing conditions, a measure that is termed  
the freezing degree day index . In milder climates in the United  
States, the local building codes might stipulate a frost protection  
depth for foundations of 12 in. In the northern portions of the  
United States, the frost protection depth might be 42 to 60 in.  
required by local building codes. These guidelines are usually con-  
servative, but there are situations where deeper frost protection  
depths are warranted. For instance, if the emergency entrance to  
a hospital is on the north side of the hospital, where the sun never  
warms the pavement adjacent to the building, and the pavement is  
kept 100 percent snow-free for safety reasons, then the frost  
penetration can easily exceed the code requirements.

# ENVIRONMENT CLIMATE ZONE  
Though classified as arid and overheated, severe desert climates  
in the United States typically have four distinct periods for deter-  
mining comfort strategies.  
The hot dry season , occurring in late spring, early summer, and  
early fall, has dry, clear atmospheres that provide high insulation  
levels, high daytime air temperatures, very high sol-air tempera-  
tures, and large thermal radiation losses at night, producing a 30°F  
to 40°F daily range. Nighttime temperatures may fall below the  
comfort limits and are useful for cooling. Low humidity allows  
effective evaporative cooling.  
The hot humid season occurs in July and August. In addition to high  
insulation, it is characterized by high dew point temperatures  
\(above 55°F\), reducing the usefulness of evaporative cooling for  
comfort conditioning. Cloudiness and haze prevent nighttime ther-  
mal re-radiation, resulting in only a 20°F or less daily range.  
Lowest nighttime temperatures are frequently higher than the  
comfort limits. Thus, refrigeration or dehumidification may be  
needed to meet comfort standards.  
The winter season typically has clear skies, cold nights, very low  
dew point temperatures, a daily range of nearly 40°F, and the oppor-  
tunity for passively meeting all heating requirements from isolation.  
The transitional or thermal sailing season occurs before and after  
the winter season and requires no intervention by environmental  
control systems. This season can be extended by the passive fea-  
tures of the building. Other desert climates have similar seasons  
but in different proportions and at cooler scales.  
Capitalize on climatic conditions by incorporating construction  
practices that respond in beneficial ways to the environment,  
including\:  
Insulate coolant and refrigerant pipes from remote evaporative  
towers and condensers for their entire length.  
In hot locations, use roof construction similar to the cold climate  
roof detail.  
Do not use exposed wood \(especially in small cross sections\) and  
many plastics, as they deteriorate from excessive heat and high  
ultraviolet exposure.  
Although vapor retarders may not be critical to control condensa-  
tion, implement them as a building wrap or wind shield, both to  
control dust penetration and to avoid convective leaks from high  
temperature differentials.  
Avoid thermal bridges such as extensive cantilevered slabs.  
Radiant barriers and details appropriate to humid overheated cli-  
mates are at least as effective as vapor retarders, but avoid holes  
in assembly where convection would leak their thermal advantage.  
Ventilate building skin \(attic or roof, walls\) to relieve sol-air heat  
transfer.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Humid, overheated conditions are most severe along the Gulf  
Coast, but occur across the entire southeastern United States.  
Atmospheric moisture limits radiation exchange, resulting in daily  
temperature ranges less than 20°F. High insulation gives first pri-  
ority to shading. Much of the overheated period is only a few  
degrees above comfort limits, so air movement can cool the body.  
Ground temperatures are generally too high for the Earth to be  
useful as a heat sink, although slab-on-grade floor mass is useful.  
The strategies are to resist solar and conductive heat gains and to  
take best advantage of ventilation.

# THERMAL COMFORT  
The bioclimatic chart \(Olgyay, Design with Climate , updated by  
Givoni and Arens\) is presented here in standard psychrometric  
format. Plotting temperature and humidity data on the chart identi-  
fies cooling strategies for buildings dominated by envelope loads.  
The heavy lines in Figure 2.26 delineate limits within which ventila-  
tion, massive construction, evaporative space cooling, and clothing  
can maintain thermal comfort indoors.  
Whole-house \(exhaust\) fans provide up to 20 air changes per hour  
and, like continuous cross ventilation, maintain indoor tempera-  
tures close to the outdoors. As long as outdoor conditions are  
within the comfort zone, “air-exchange ventilation” maintains  
indoor comfort. “Body ventilation” is best provided by ceiling  
\(paddle\) fans. They are effective up to 70 percent relative humidity  
and 85°F effective temperature \(ET\), with a maximum air speed of  
3 fps and light clothing \(0.4–0.6 clo\).  
A very massive building envelope can maintain indoor comfort if  
outdoor air temperature does not exceed the thermal mass limit on  
the chart \(roughly equal to 89°F ET\). This requires that \(1\) the  
envelope is shaded or reflective enough that its average daily  
outside surface temperature is no higher than the daily mean air  
temperature; \(2\) the envelope is massive enough to average daily  
temperature fluctuations; and \(3\) there is no daytime ventilation of  
the indoors. Nighttime ventilation extends the upper limit by cool-  
ing the envelope from both sides.  
Intake ventilation air is evaporatively cooled by drawing it through  
wetted mats or filters. The technique is suited to arid and semiarid  
regions and requires a fan-powered ventilation system. The limits  
are 71.5°F wet-bulb temperature and in excess of 105°F dry bulb,  
which is a conservative upper bound.  
business suit is 1.0 clo. One can feel as comfortable at 80°F with  
20 percent RH as at 76°F at 80 percent RH; both are 78°F ET. The  
ASHRAE comfort zone is bounded by an upper humidity limit of  
about 62°F dew point; 65°F is a conservative limit. A mean daily  
dew-point temperature of 50°F produces diurnal air temperature  
swings in excess of 30°F.  
Wind speeds and direction are important for site analysis and for  
orienting the building for shelter from winter winds and to capture  
cooling breezes. Solar radiation data \(“irradiation” or “insolation”\)  
is necessary for solar heating and daylighting design. Insolation,  
measured in Btu/sq. ft./day \(or per hour\), is a function of latitude,  
sky conditions, and angle of incidence to the receiving surface \(see  
Kusuda and Ishii, 1977\). Ground temperatures at various depths  
can be estimated from well-water temperatures \(see Labs, 1981\).  
A relationship exists between outdoor the environmental condi-  
tions and the perceived indoor human comfort due to behavioral,  
physiological, and psychological human thermal adaption.

The effective temperature, ET, refers to any set of temperature and  
humidity conditions that gives the same sensation of comfort as  
the stated temperature at 50 percent relative humidity \(RH\). ET  
plotted in Figure 2.26 assumes light office clothing \(0.6 clo\) and  
very little air movement. A clo is the insulating value of clothing. A  
Design professionals should combine data derived from climatic  
control maps with data derived from the average number of  
Heating Degree Days \(HDD\) in a region when designing for differ-  
ent parts of the country. Figure 2.27 provides winter weather data  
and design conditions for locations within the United States.

# DAYLIGHTING  
Architects understand design of space and light as a central prin-  
ciple of form making. The term daylighting requires clear definition,  
as it represents multiple design intentions, often at cross-purposes.  
Daylighting design incorporates strategies for controlling the way  
light enters a building while also considering energy, lighting  
design, operable shades, and controls. Daylighting design uses  
scientific tools, but is ultimately an art, concerned with comfort,  
quality of light, and space, as well as more measurable attributes  
such as footcandle levels and energy savings.  
Sustainable design is universally understood to be about whole  
systems integration, and nothing illustrates the case better than  
daylighting, which optimizes the relationship between energy, task  
visibility, comfort, cost, controls, color, character, and connection to  
the outdoors. Daylight can achieve very different goals through  
systems integration. One building might strive to keep direct sun  
from entering, another might seek optimal visual comfort, and still  
others might use daylighting primarily to achieve energy efficiency.  
Algorithms that model energy performance of daylighting strate-  
gies are beginning to be integrated into existing energy modeling  
software. Good design incorporates the qualitative aspects of  
daylighting as part of an overall lighting and envelope strategy,  
optimizing user control of lighting and operable window shades or  
window blinds.

Daylighting design is part of a broader approach to building.  
Maximizing energy efficiency often means compromising daylight.  
A small amount of dark-tinted glass in an office building might be  
the energy solution, but it yields an interior that feels disconnected  
from the outdoors, gloomy, and dependent on low-level light. There  
is no one right answer, but the degree of connectedness to the  
outside world desired and the nature of outdoor light quality are  
critical factors. In a mostly cloudy climate, clear glass and light  
monitors can be elements of an essential design strategy. In a cli-  
mate with intense direct sun, finding ways to reflect light, modulate  
brightness in increments, and provide relief from glare can be the  
keys to good daylighting. A number of these factors are defined  
briefly here\:  
Daylight and views\: Daylight and views are often linked as con-  
cepts, but there is no real basis for this connection other than  
the fact that both involve exterior wall openings. A building that  
affords great views does not, by definition, provide great day-  
lighting, and a well-daylit building might afford no views at all!  
What constitutes a view is easily defined in technical terms as a  
window with a view beyond the foreground of the building. High-  
quality views are more difficult to define.  
Ambient brightness\: The brightness of the sky dome at various  
times of day is critical. Bright, cloudy days actually have higher  
ambient brightness than clear, sunny days. Outdoor light on a  
surface can be measured at as much as 10,000 footcandles \(fc\),  
but the human eye can read comfortably at fewer than 10 fc  
\(even at 1\). This ambient level changes throughout the day.  
Modeling can measure the sky dome under both clear and  
cloudy conditions.  
Daylight factor\: The quantitative measurement of openings and  
transparency in the building envelope is referred to as the day-  
light factor . It is not a measure of daylight quality and does not  
take glare into account.  
Illuminance and luminosity\: Measurement of light incident on a  
surface, or illuminance \(measured in lumens per square meter,  
or footcandles\), is not the same measurement as what the eye  
sees reflected from the surface. The reflected light luminance, or  
luminosity \(measured in candelas per square meter, or footlam-  
berts\), is what makes up the field of view; and relative brightness  
within that field is what determines level of both comfort and  
stimulation. Because good lighting design involves the skillful  
use of reflected light through the illumination of wall and ceiling  
surfaces, luminance is a critical measurement. Most lighting  
design guidelines, however, measure footcandles incident on a  
work surface.  
Adaptation to light intensity\: The human eye is resilient and can  
adapt to changes in light level by approximately a factor of 10.  
For example, entering a building on a day with 10,000 fc light  
level to below a canopy with ambient light of 1000 fc is still rela-  
tively comfortable. Entering the foyer of the building with a level  
of 100 fc is again comfortable, making it possible to move to an  
interior office with 10 fc. Without intermediate steps the eye has  
trouble adjusting and takes a moment to refocus. This phenom-  
enon is a serious factor in many situations, such as transitioning  
from brightly illuminated service stations to driving on a dark  
highway, where the eye might take several minutes to readjust.  
Adaptation decreases with age and eyestrain.  
Glare\: Glare is defined as discomfort or interference with visual  
perception caused by a high differential in light levels within the  
field of view. The eye adapts to the brighter area, making adapta-  
tion to the darker area difficult or impossible.  
Perimeter daylight, glass location, and building section\: Bringing  
light into a space and reflecting it onto the ceiling and high wall  
surfaces is critical to good daylighting. Glass below desk height  
is of little value to daylighting. A variety of light-reflecting  
devices are available for this purpose. A good rule of thumb is  
to use high, clear, continuous horizontal glass that can be shad-  
ed from low-angle sun as needed. If a commercial building has  
a high floor-to-floor section that yields a generous clear interior  
height, this transom zone, generally above the height of interior  
doors, can have glass of 2 ft. high or more. The appropriate  
height for an interior space depends on use and building width.  
In general, well-daylit buildings in Europe and the United States  
are 50 to 80 ft. wide. A 60-ft building width with high ceilings can  
allow virtually continuous daylight and a central space that  
benefits from all exposures. More common office buildings in  
the United States have deep floors of 100 ft. or more, yielding a  
25-ft potential daylight zone at the perimeter and a 50-ft zone at  
the core, which is fully dependent on electric lighting.  
Roof windows and skylights\: Light travels in a straight line with  
minimal diffusion. In general, areas below a skylight \(even on a  
cloudy day\) will form a bright spot that contrasts dramatically  
with the space around it. Roof windows and skylights acting in  
conjunction with reflective surfaces bounce light back to the  
ceiling and even eliminate direct-beam penetration. Skylights in  
art museums often employ baffles or fabric or glass diffusers  
inside or outside the building envelope. Without some form of  
diffusion, skylights alone must be larger to be effective daylight-  
ing devices. Larger skylights become sources of heat gain and  
heat loss, but can also provide a welcome connection to the  
outdoors.  
Light monitors and clerestories\: These provide light in a more  
controlled manner than skylights. A monitor is a rooftop struc-  
ture with a vertical glass and a roof. A clerestory is like a moni-  
tor, but with glass on only one side. An east-west orientation and  
strategically sized overhangs can make a monitor a very effec-  
tive daylight source, one that eliminates many of the issues  
associated with skylights. Direct-beam penetration is controlled,  
vertical surfaces are illuminated, potential leaks and heat loss  
are reduced, and snow cannot cover the protected vertical  
surfaces.  
Light shelves\: Light shelves reflect direct sunlight onto the ceiling  
into a space. A light shelf can be located inside or outside the  
building. Light shelves are not exterior shades by definition, but  
an exterior sun shade with a reflective top surface can be a light  
shelf. A secondary but important function of light shelves is the  
screening of glare caused by direct views of the sky. Once this  
glare is reduced, overall light levels in a space can be reduced  
while maintaining comfort.  
Exterior shading\: Shading elements such as overhangs and  
awnings can limit direct-beam penetration into a space. Such  
elements also cut down on daylight. The best solution in any  
particular situation involves consideration of the planning and  
use of the space, climate, and expectations related to use and  
comfort. Exterior shading on southern exposures is almost  
always beneficial, as it keeps direct sun out at midday in the  
summer and lets light and corresponding heat into buildings in  
the winter. Shading of vision glass is beneficial, as it is lower on  
the wall than transom glass and of lesser value in terms of  
reflectance deep into the space. At the same time, this shading  
of vision glass can help block direct view of the sky, reducing  
glare in the field of view.  
Interior window shades and window blinds\: Window blinds and  
roller window shades are the most common and economical  
means of sun control. Although they do little to combat heat  
gain, shades and blinds are an integral part of any daylighting  
strategy. Reflective window blinds function as adjustable day-  
lighting devices, reflecting light onto the ceiling. Roller window  
shades and pleated window shades are available in a variety of  
fabrics with measurable levels of light transmittance, interior  
and exterior colors, and automation systems.  
Daylighting comprises two interrelated concepts\: providing appro-  
priate light levels on surfaces and mitigating direct-beam light  
penetration when it is unwanted. Computer daylight modeling can  
address both.  
Computer modeling\: The ease with which three-dimensional model-  
ing now simulates solar movement is making this the preferred  
strategy employed by increasing numbers of designers. Computer  
simulations are a permanent record allowing more iterations than  
a physical model.  
The architect should consider the following items in designing an  
energy-efficient nonresidential building, regardless of size and  
building type.  
Place windows high in the wall of each floor. Windows placed high  
in the wall near the ceiling provide the most daylight for any given  
window area, permitting daylight to penetrate more deeply into the  
interior.

# ENVIRONMENT DAYLIGHTING  
Use light shelves. Light shelves are horizontal projections placed  
on the outside and below a window to reflect sunlight into the  
interior. Typically placed just above eye level, the light shelf reflects  
daylight onto the interior ceiling, making it a light-reflecting sur-  
face \(instead of a dark, shaded surface typical of a conventional  
interior ceiling\). At the same time, the light shelf shades the lower  
portion of the window, reducing the amount of light near the win-  
dow, which is typically overlit. The result is more balanced daylight-  
ing with less glare and contrast between light levels in the interior.  
Size windows according to use and orientation. Because window  
glass has little or no resistance to heat flow, it is one of the pri-  
mary sources of energy waste and discomfort. Window areas  
should be shaded against direct solar gain during overheated  
hours. Even when shaded, windows gain undesired heat when the  
outdoor temperature exceeds the human comfort limit. Window  
areas should, therefore, be kept to a reasonable minimum, justified  
by clearly defined needs for view, visual relief, ventilation, and/or  
daylighting.  
Use skylighting for daylighting, with proper solar controls.  
Skylighting that is properly sized and oriented is an efficient and  
cost-effective source of lighting. Consider that for most office  
buildings, sunlight is available for nearly the entire period of occu-  
pancy and that the lighting requirement for interior lighting is only  
about 1 percent of the amount of light available outside. Electric  
lighting costs, peak demand charges, and work interruptions dur-  
ing power brownouts can be greatly reduced by using daylight.  
Cost-effective, energy-efficient skylights can be small, spaced  
widely, with “splayed” interior light wells that help reflect and dif-  
fuse the light. White-painted ceilings and walls further improve the  
efficiency of daylighting \(by as much as 300 percent, when com-  
pared with dark interior finishes\). Skylights should include some  
means to control undesired solar gain by one or more of the follow-  
ing means\: \(1\) Face the skylight to the polar orientation; \(2\) pro-  
vide exterior light-reflecting sun shading; and \(3\) provide movable  
sunshades on the inside, with a means to vent the heat above the  
sunshade.  
heated is with plant bed or root heating, as with water tubes or air  
tubes in gravel or earth. Plants also benefit from gentle air move-  
ment, which reduces excessive moisture that might rot the plants,  
and circulates carbon dioxide needed for growth.  
An atrium with the predominant function to provide natural lighting  
takes its shape from the predominant sky condition. In cool, cloudy  
climates, ideally, the atrium cross section would be stepped out-  
ward as it gets higher, to increase overhead lighting. In hot, sunny  
locations with clear sunny skies, the cross section is like a large  
lighting fixture designed to reflect, diffuse, and make usable the  
light from above. Daylighting design is complicated by the move-  
ment of the sun as it changes position with respect to the building  
throughout the day and the year.  
Healthy greenery can be incorporated in atrium design. The  
designer needs to know the unique horticultural requirements for  
the plant species for lighting, heating, and cooling, which could be  
quite different from those for human occupancy. Generally, plants  
need higher light levels and cooler temperatures than might be  
comfortable for humans. The most efficient manner to keep plants  
Interaction of sunlight with the atmosphere results in color changes  
throughout the day. The appearance of colors and textures of mate-  
rials and coatings is strongly affected by this interaction. Cities and  
regions throughout the world are known for their light quality. Los  
Angeles has a bright, even, flat light created by dispersion of light  
through smog and mist. Coastal light, in general, benefits from the  
reflection off the water. Combinations of solar altitude, presence  
and location of water vapor in the atmosphere, surface water, color  
and topography of the surrounding landscape, and dust particles  
create a unique profile of ambient light. Material choice wedded to  
the light quality of a place is critical to the success of good design.  
Good architectural daylighting takes the unique nature of place into  
account.  
Color temperature is measured in degrees Kelvin based on the  
radiation emitted from a theoretical object called a “black body  
radiator.” When the radiator is heated, it changes from black to red  
to yellow to white to blue. The lower the Kelvin rating, the warmer,  
or more yellow, the light. The higher the rating, the cooler, or more  
blue, the light.  
Research indicates that humans prefer cooler light at higher inten-  
sity and warmer light at lower intensity. Dim fluorescent lights appear  
gloomy; likewise, bright, warm color lights are uncomfortable.

Another significant variable in lighting and daylighting related to  
sustainable design is the capability of the source to accurately  
reproduce colors compared to the continuous spectrum of the sun.  
The sun has a color rendition index \(CRI\) of 100 \(percent\). Light  
from radiation of an incandescent filament also has a CRI of 100.  
Fluorescent lights, however, have lower CRI, as they attempt to  
re-create the full spectrum through phosphors that cover multiple  
segments of the visible spectrum to achieve the appearance of  
while light.

Some whites are whiter than others, and by a greater margin than  
is generally understood. A bright white paint can be far more  
reflective than off-white, which is an order of magnitude more  
reflective than colors. Pure white can be close to 90 percent reflec-  
tive, off-white at 80 percent. Black is only 4 percent reflective, and  
deep colors are between 10 and 30 percent reflective. The implica-  
tions of this for daylighting \(and for urban heat island effect\) are  
significant. White roofs reach a maximum temperature of 110°F,  
whereas dark asphalt or rubber roofs reach 190°F.  
The visible transmittance of glass \(Vt\) is critical to the success of  
daylighting. In general, clear glass, even with low-E coatings, pro-  
vides less shading and allows more heat gain than tinted or more  
heavily coated glass. See Table 9.9 for window types and visible  
transmittance.  
Perimeter lighting can be turned off when daylighting is effective.  
In continuously occupied space with individual switches, this can  
be accomplished by individuals who learn to control their work-  
space—in other words, no automation. The other extreme is a fully  
automated building where photocells and motors adjust lights and  
shading devices. Each project needs to weigh pros and cons of user  
control and automation.  
Photosensors that raise and lower window or sun shading devices  
and modulate light fixtures can be used in concert with time clocks  
and occupancy sensors to achieve a fully integrated system.  
Here is an example strategy\:  
1\. Perimeter office lights are off at the beginning of the workday,  
and window shades are raised automatically before sunrise.  
2\. Occupants can choose to turn on overhead lights in the office  
and dim to a comfortable level.  
3\. An occupancy sensor turns off light when an occupant leaves the  
room for a set period of time and returns it to the same level  
when the occupant returns.  
4\. Exterior sun control devices are programmed to be lowered  
automatically in preset increments by time clock in summer  
months and manually at other times of year.  
# ACOUSTICS  
Sound is energy produced by a vibrating object or surface and trans-  
mitted as a wave through an elastic medium. Such a medium may be  
air \(airborne sound\) or any solid common building material, such as  
steel, concrete, wood, piping, gypsum board, and so on \(structure-  
borne sound\). A sound wave has amplitude and frequency .  
The amplitude of sound waves is measured in decibels \(dB\).  
The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale based on the logarithm of the  
ratio of a sound pressure to a reference sound pressure \(the  
threshold of audibility\). The values of a logarithmic scale, such as  
the decibel levels of two noise sources, cannot be added directly.  
Instead, use the simplified method described in Figure 2.53. For  
example, 90 dB + 20 dB = 90 dB; 60 dB + 60 dB = 63 dB.  
All materials and surfaces absorb some sound. The percentage of  
incident sound energy that is absorbed by a material, divided by 100,  
equals the coefficient of absorption , which ranges from 0 to 0.99.  
The coefficient varies as a function of frequency, measured in hertz.  
Any material can be tested in a proper laboratory to determine its  
coefficient of absorption values, as per ASTM C 423, “Standard Test  
Method for Sound Absorption and Sound Absorption Coefficients by  
the Reverberation Room Method.”  
The sound absorption coefficient for a given material may vary  
depending on the thickness of the material, how it is supported or  
mounted, the depth of the airspace behind the material, and the  
facing in front of the material. In general, thicker, porous materials  
absorb more sound. The airspace behind a material will increase  
the absorption efficiency, especially at low frequencies. Thin fac-  
ings degrade high-frequency absorption.

There are three mechanisms by which sound energy is absorbed or  
dissipated as it strikes a surface. In all cases, sound energy is  
converted to heat, although not enough heat to be felt.  
Porous absorption entails the use of soft, porous, fuzzy materials  
such as glass fiber, mineral wool, and carpet. The pressure fluctua-  
tions of a sound wave in air cause the fibers of such materials to  
move, and the friction of the fibers dissipates the sound energy.  
Panel absorption involves installation of thin lightweight panels  
such as gypsum board, glass, and plywood. Sound waves cause  
these panels to vibrate. Sound absorption for a panel is greatest at  
its natural or resonant frequency.  
Cavity absorption entails the movement of air pressure fluctua-  
tions across the narrow neck of an enclosed air cavity, such as the  
space behind a perforated panel or a slotted concrete masonry  
unit, also called a Helmholtz resonator . Friction of the resonating  
air molecules against the wall of the neck converts sound energy  
to heat. If there is also insulation within the cavity, additional  
energy is extracted via the porous absorption mechanism.  
The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz \(Hz; also  
known as cycles per second\) and grouped into octaves ; an octave  
band is labeled by its geometric center frequency. An octave band  
covers the range from one frequency \(Hz\) to twice that frequency  
\(f to 2f\). The range of human hearing covers the frequencies from  
20 to 16,000 Hz. Human hearing is most acute in the 1000- to 4000-  
Hz octave bands.  
The human ear discriminates against low frequencies in a manner  
matched by the A-weighting filter of a sound-level meter, measured  
in dBA, or A-weighted decibels. This is the most universally  
accepted single-number rating for human response to sound.  
Following are acoustic measurement terms\:  
• Apparent Sound Transmission Class \(ASTC\)\: Field measurement  
that covers all sound transfer paths between spaces. Previously  
referred to as the Noise Isolation Class \(NIC\).  
• Articulation index \(AI\)\: Measures how materials affect speech  
intelligibility in offices.  
• Average room absorption coefficient \(average coefficient of  
absorption\)\: Total room absorption divided by total room surface  
area.  
One measure of the quality of sound in a room is the average coef-  
ficient of absorption for all surfaces combined. As determined by  
using the average coefficient of absorption, the quality of sound in  
a room can be evaluated as 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3. A room with an average  
coefficient of 0.1 is rather acoustically live , loud, and uncomfort-  
ably noisy; one with an average coefficient of 0.2 is comfortable,  
with well-controlled noise; and one with 0.3 is rather acoustically  
dead , suitable for spaces in which the emphasis will be on  
amplified sound, electronic playback, or a live microphone for  
teleconferencing.  
The sound absorption average \(SAA\) is a new single-number mea-  
sure of sound absorption that is replacing the noise reduction  
coefficient \(NRC\) rating. The SAA is the average of sound absorp-  
tion coefficients of a material from 200 to 2500 Hz inclusive. The  
method for determining the SAA is defined by ASTM C 423, as  
described below.  
Pink noise \(a mixture of sound waves that diminish in intensity  
proportionately with frequency\) is emitted from two loudspeakers  
in the receiving room. While the sound is triggered on and off, 50  
sample decay rates \(from 80 to 500 Hz\) are measured with  
\(referred to as full room \) and without \(referred to as empty room \)

the test specimen installed in the chamber. The decay rate data is  
used to calculate the empty- and full-room absorption. The empty-  
and full-room absorption is used to calculate the SAA rating.  
Although NRC ratings have been replaced by the SAA, manufactur-  
ers often continue to report only NRC values, and NRC values are  
often given for historic comparison.  
Usually, the numerical value of the NRC is almost the same as that  
of the SAA. A rating of 0.35 is considered indicative of good sound  
absorption, whether given as an NRC or SAA rating.  
Figure 2.34 gives representative absorption coefficients at various  
frequencies for some typical materials. To determine values not  
provided here, refer to the manufacturer’s data or extrapolate  
from similar constructions. All materials have some absorption  
values that can be determined from proper test reports. NRC val-

encing. Longer reverberation times add richness to concert and  
liturgical music.  
Apparent Sound Transmission Class \(ASTC\) ratings, which cover  
effects from all sound transfer paths between rooms. ASTC rat-  
ings, previously referred to as the Noise Isolation Class \(NIC\), are  
derived by using the STC procedure \(ASTM E 413, “Classification  
for Rating Sound Insulation”\) to rate the uncorrected sound-level  
difference spectrum without correction or normalization factors.  
Sound-absorptive materials \(such as acoustic tile, glass fiber, wall  
panels, carpet, curtains, etc.\) can be added to a room in order to  
control or reduce noise levels or shorten reverberation time. Noise  
control is especially helpful when the noise sources are distributed  
around a room, as in a gymnasium, classroom, or cafeteria.  
The following figures provide detail for measuring sound absorption.

The sabin is defined as a unit of sound absorption. One square  
meter of 100 percent absorbing material has a value of one metric  
sabin. The unit is named in honor of Wallace Clement Sabine, con-  
sidered the father of acoustic design.  
The total sabins in a room can be determined by adding together  
the sabins of all the surfaces, which vary as a function of fre-  
quency. Because most materials absorb more high-frequency  
sound waves than low-frequency ones, it is typical to find more  
sabins in a room at high frequencies than at low frequencies.  
In general, sound energy that is not absorbed will be reflected;  
thus, surfaces with low coefficients of absorption can be used to  
encourage sound reflection when appropriate.

acoustically sensitive spaces  
Special considerations and  
complex applications  
Design of construction and materials for high transmission loss  
builds on three principles\: mass, separation, and absorption.  
Mass\: Lightweight materials do not block sound. Sound transmis-  
sion through walls, floors, and ceilings varies with the frequency of  
sound, the weight \(or mass\) and stiffness of the construction, and  
the cavity absorption.  
Separation\: Improved TL performance without an undue increase  
in mass can be achieved by separation of materials. A true double  
wall with separate unconnected elements performs better than the  
mass law predicts for a single wall of the same weight.  
Absorption\: Use of soft, resilient, absorptive materials in the cavity  
between wythes, particularly for lightweight staggered or double-  
stud construction, increases transmission loss significantly.  
Viscoelastic \(somewhat resilient but not fully elastic\) materials,  
such as certain insulation boards, dampen or restrict the vibration  
of rigid panels such as gypsum board and plywood, increasing  
transmission loss somewhat. Follow manufacturer-recommended  
installation details.  
If two layers of dense material are separated by an airspace  
\(rather than being continuous\), they create two independent walls.  
The improvement in transmission loss depends on the size of the  
airspace and the frequency of the sound. Avoid rigid ties between  
layers in all double-wall construction.  
When a wall or surface of a room is made up of two or more differ-  
ent structures \(e.g., a window in an outside wall or a door in an  
office\), the TL performance \(or STC\) of the composite construction  
should be evaluated by combining the TL \(or STC\) values of the  
components. Note that small gaps and cracks, such as the perimeter  
of an ungasketed door, can dramatically degrade the performance of  
a high-TL construction.  
Distance and time are two defining properties of sound. Outdoors,  
sound drops off 6 dB each time the distance from a source is  
doubled \(inverse square law\). Indoors, the reflecting sound energy  
in a room reaches a constant level as a function of the sound-  
absorbing units \(sabins\) in the room.  
Outdoors, sound ceases when the source stops. Indoors, sound  
energy lingers; this decay is called reverberation . The reverbera-  
tion time \(RT\) is defined as the length of time in seconds that it  
takes for sound to decay by 60 dB. Reverberation time is directly  
proportional to the volume of a space and inversely proportional to  
the units of absorption \(sabins\) in it.  
Shorter reverberation times greatly enhance speech intelligibility  
and are imperative in listening environments for people with hearing  
The property of a material or construction system that blocks the  
transfer of sound energy from one side to another is sound trans-  
mission loss \(TL\), which is measured in decibels. Specifically, TL is  
the attenuation of airborne sound transmission through a con-  
struction during laboratory testing, according to ASTM E 90,  
“Standard Test Method for Laboratory Measurement of Airborne  
Sound Transmission Loss of Building Partitions and Elements.”  
Transmission loss values range from 0 to 70 or higher. A high TL  
value indicates a better capability to block sound; that is, more  
sound energy is lost \(transformed into heat energy\) as the sound  
wave travels through the material.  
Sound transmission class \(STC\) is a single-number rating system  
designed to combine TL values from many frequencies. STC values  
for site-built construction range from 10 \(practically no isolation;  
e.g., an open doorway\) to 65 or 70 \(such high performance is only  
achieved with special construction techniques\). Average construc-  
tion might provide noise reduction in the range of STC 30 to 60.  
It is very difficult to measure the STC performance of a single wall  
or door in the field because of the number of flanking paths and  
nonstandard conditions. Field performance is measured with

Noise reduction \(NR\) depends on the properties of a room and is  
the actual difference in sound pressure level between two spaces.  
It is the amount of sound blocked by all intervening sound paths  
between rooms, including the common wall but also the floor, ceil-  
ing, outside path, doors, and other flanking paths.  
Noise reduction also depends on the relative size of a room. If the  
noise source is in a small room next to a large receiving room \(e.g.,  
an office next to a gymnasium\), the noise reduction will be greater  
than the TL performance of the wall alone because the sound  
radiating from the common wall between office and gym will be  
dissipated in such a large space. On the other hand, if the noise  
source is in a large room next to a small one \(as from a gym to an  
office next door\), the noise reduction will be far less than the TL of  
the wall alone because the common wall, which radiates sound, is  
such a large part of the surface of the smaller room. An adjustment  
for this ratio, plus the contribution of the absorptive finishes in the  
receiving room, enters into the calculation of actual noise reduc-  
tion between adjacent spaces.

One of the most common goals in the design of sound isolation  
construction is achievement of acoustic privacy from a neighbor.  
This privacy is a function of whether the signal from the neighbor  
is audible and intelligible above the ordinary background noise  
level in the environment. Noise reduction is measured as a field  
performance, where it is evaluated and given an STC value. The  
privacy index is equal to noise reduction plus background noise  
that masks speech sounds.

Normal privacy, in which you are aware of a neighbor’s activity but  
not overly distracted by it, can usually be achieved with a privacy  
index of 68 or higher. Confidential privacy, in which you are unaware  
of the neighbor, usually requires a privacy index of 75 or higher.  
A quiet environment with little or no natural background sound  
between neighbors requires a higher degree of sound separation  
construction to achieve the same privacy as does a noisier environ-  
ment with louder background sound.  
The level of continuous background noise, such as that provided by  
the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning \(HVAC\) system or by  
electronic masking, has a significant impact on the quality of con-  
struction selected and must be coordinated with the other design  
parameters.  
Ratings for interior occupied spaces depend on the nature of the  
exterior background noise—its level, spectrum shape, and  
constancy—as well as thermal considerations and the client’s  
budget.  
The STC ratings shown in Figure 2.36 for music practice rooms are  
guidelines only. These spaces typically require double-layer con-  
struction with resilient connections between layers or, preferably,  
structurally independent “room within a room” construction.  
The following figure provides STC data for sound isolation.

The International Building Code \(IBC\) sets requirements for sound  
transmission control in residential buildings. It applies to common  
interior walls, partitions, and floor and ceiling assemblies between  
adjacent dwelling units or between dwelling units and adjacent  
public areas such as corridors, stairs, or service areas.  
Ratings for multifamily housing depend on nighttime exterior back-  
ground levels and other factors directly related to the location of a  
building. Grades I, II, and III are discussed in A Guide to Airborne,  
Impact, and Structureborne Noise Control in Multifamily Dwellings ,  
HUD TS-24 \(1974\).  
The STC ratings of building assemblies are established when test-  
ed in accordance with ASTM E 90, “Standard Test Method for  
Laboratory Measurement of Airborne Sound Transmission Loss of  
Building Partitions and Elements.” Impact insulation class \(IIC\)  
ratings for floor-ceiling assemblies are established when tested in  
accordance with ASTM E 492, “Standard Test Method for  
Laboratory Measurement of Impact Sound Transmission through  
Floor-Ceiling Assemblies Using the Tapping Machine.”

Floors are subject to impact or structure-borne sound transmission  
noises such as footfalls, dropped objects, and scraping furniture.  
Parallel to the development of laboratory STC ratings for partition  
constructions is the development of an impact insulation class  
\(IIC\). This is a single-number rating system used to evaluate the  
effectiveness of floor construction in preventing impact sound  
transmission to spaces beneath the floor. The current IIC rating  
system is similar to the STC rating system.  
Testing for IIC ratings is a complex procedure using a standard  
tapping machine. The machine cannot simulate the weight of a  
person walking across a floor; therefore, the creak or boom that  
footsteps cause in a wood-framed floor cannot be reflected in the  
single-figure impact rating produced from the tapping machine. The  
correlation between tapping machine tests in the laboratory and  
field performance of floors under typical conditions may vary  
greatly, depending on the construction of the floor and the nature  
of the impact.

# ENVIRONMENT ACOUSTICS  
The reduction of airborne sound transmission, such as normal  
conversation and other office noise, is identified by STC ratings.  
The STC does not identify reductions of impact or vibration noise,  
which are classified by the IIC ratings. Impact and vibration noises  
may require isolation and sound dampening through means other  
than the partition.  
Partition STC ratings are dependent on the partition mass, resil-  
iency or isolation, dampening, and sound absorption. Multilayer  
partitions have more mass than single-layer partitions. Wood studs  
are less resilient than steel studs and transmit more sound.  
Isolating wood studs by staggering their placement or using resil-  
ient channels improves the resistance to sound transmission.  
Sound attenuation insulation provides sound dampening and  
absorption.  
Acoustic partitions require sealant at the perimeter edges of the  
partition assembly, as well as at openings in the gypsum board  
panel such as junction boxes and other wall penetrations.  
Published sound-rating assembly performance is developed under  
controlled laboratory conditions. Actual performance may vary  
from the published STC rating.

Depending on the intended function, many spaces require a certain  
level of sound isolation from surrounding areas. Many common  
building components are available with specific acoustic ratings,  
but generally require specialized design and construction to  
achieve good performance. For example, where a high level of  
sound isolation is required between spaces that also need a visual  
connection, standard window assemblies may not be sufficient.  
Acoustic windows typically have two panes of laminated glass 1/4  
to 1/2 in. \(6 to 13 mm\) thick, separated by a 1- to 4-in. \(25 to 102  
mm\) airspace, and have been designed as an assembly to meet  
specific performance requirements up to approximately STC 55.  
absorption, but the noise from telephones, conversation, equipment,  
and other sources is usually audible. An acoustic ceiling and carpet  
on the floor will absorb some of the sound. An acoustic engineer can  
offer suggestions on how to contain and control noise. Sound-  
masking systems, utilizing white noise, are increasingly considered  
a necessity.  
Speech intelligibility and acoustics in an open-plan office can be  
rated in terms of an articulation index \(AI\), which is a measure of  
the ratio between a signal \(a neighbor’s voice or intrusive noise\)  
and steady background noise \(ambient noise from mechanical  
equipment, traffic, or electronic sound masking\). When communi-  
cation is desired, for example, in classrooms or teleconference  
rooms, it is preferable to have a high AI so that people can hear  
well. In an office environment, however, it is preferable to have a  
low AI, which is more conducive to concentration.  
AI values range from near 0 to 1.0\:  
• Near 0\: Very low signal and relatively high noise, with no intel-  
ligibility or good speech privacy  
• Near 1.0\: Very high signal and low noise with excellent commu-  
nication or no speech privacy  
Low AI ratings for open-plan office spaces can be achieved in three  
primary ways\: by blocking sound, by covering \(masking \) sound, and  
by absorbing sound.  
The barrier should be able to block sound at least as well as the  
path for sound traveling over the barrier, which means a minimum  
laboratory STC value of 24. Barriers or screens should extend to  
the floor or leave only an inch or so open at the bottom. There  
should be no open gaps between adjacent panels. Barriers may  
need to have sound-absorbing facings to reduce reflections to the  
next workstation.

Open offices can provide great flexibility in office arrangements  
and workflow. However, because workstations or cubicles do not  
have full-height partitions, noise can be a major problem. The  
extent to which speech is distracting depends on its level of intel-  
ligibility. An overheard conversation may be annoying or distract-  
ing, while an inaudible murmur may not. When designing open  
offices, the need for communication between workstations should  
be evaluated in light of work functions and practical separation.  
Acoustics in open-plan systems furniture installations present  
unique challenges. Sound travels in all directions and may be difficult  
to contain. The use of acoustic panels somewhat improves sound  
Partial-height barriers or partitions are necessary to block direct  
sound transmission between workstations. The barriers must be  
high enough and wide enough to interrupt the line of sight  
between a source and a receiver; hence, the first 4 ft. \(1.2 m\) or  
so of barrier height do not help speech privacy significantly.  
Barrier heights of 5 ft. \(1.5 m\) are a minimum requirement for  
acoustic separation, and heights of 6 ft. \(1.8 m\) are typical for  
normal privacy.  
The character and level of background sound is perhaps the most  
important acoustic design consideration for an open-plan office.  
A modest level of background or ambient sound will cover, or  
mask, annoying, intrusive sounds. Masking sound should be nei-  
ther too loud nor too quiet, between 45 and 50 dBA. Conference  
rooms and private offices, which require lower levels of back-  
ground noise, should have plenum treatments so they are  
shielded from direct exposure to the masking sound.  
Sound-masking systems comprise a noise generator, an equalizer  
to shape the sound spectrum properly, amplifiers, and loudspeak-  
ers hidden above an accessible acoustic tile ceiling. Such systems  
generate a broadband, pleasant-sounding, evenly distributed  
masking noise. The sound in the plenum filters down through the  
ceiling and provides an even blanket of sound that will mask the  
intrusive sound from a neighbor.  
Avoid untreated sound leaks in the ceiling, such as openings for  
return air; these become noticeable hot spots and draw unwanted  
attention to the sound from the ceiling. Masking sound from two  
channels can improve spatial uniformity. Ceiling height and plenum  
2.40 This figure shows a nonrated partition that can achieve a two-hour  
rating with Type X gypsum board. This design offers additional security  
due to a double layer of gypsum board. The resilient channel provides  
higher-performance sound control. Acoustic sealant is required for an  
STC rating of 55 to 60.  
2.41 This figure shows a nonrated partition commonly used in commer-  
cial and high-quality residential construction. The ceiling is installed  
prior to installation of the partition. Normal conversation is not audible,  
but loud sounds may be transmitted through the partition. STC rating of  
40 to 44.

top by 3 dBA. Changing from a mineral fiber acoustic ceiling tile  
to a glass fiber ceiling tile may reduce reflected noise by 5 dBA.  
Adding sound masking may change the ambient level by 10 to  
20 dBA.  
An acoustics consultant can evaluate proposed layouts and materi-  
als as part of the design process. The acoustic outcome of a design  
should be analyzed before construction.  
As a rough initial guideline, offices in which freedom from distrac-  
tion is the only criterion will require highly efficient sound-absorbing  
ceilings and an electronic background masking sound at levels  
between 45 and 50 dBA. For normal speech privacy, these condi-  
tions should be augmented by keeping workstations 8 to 10 ft. \(2.4  
to 3 m\) apart and adding partial-height barriers at least 5 ft. \(1.5 m\)  
high, with increased attention to office layout and reflecting sound  
paths. Confidential privacy requires higher partitions and greater  
attention to related details; it is extremely difficult to achieve this  
in an open plan.  
conditions \(fireproofing, beams, ducts, etc.\) will determine loud-  
speaker spacing and location. Electronic sound masking should be  
professionally designed and installed.  
Theaters and performance spaces are rooms in which good hear-  
ing conditions are critical to the use of the space. The design of  
a performance space generally requires input from an acoustic  
consultant.  
Sound generated by speakers or musicians should be projected  
efficiently to the audience and captured within the space. The send-  
ing end of the room \(i.e., the stage\) should be acoustically hard.  
Walls near the performer should be angled or splayed to enhance  
projection and prevent flutter echoes at the stage. Walls and ceil-  
ings in the audience area should be hard so they can reflect sound,  
unless absorptive treatment is needed to eliminate problematic  
reflections or focusing or to reduce reverberation time for particu-  
lar program needs.  
Good hearing environments should maximize the signal-to-noise  
ratio. In addition to the desired signal being well projected,  
unwanted noise should be eliminated. To accomplish this requires  
very low background sound levels \(NC 20 for concert halls, NC 25  
for smaller theaters\) from mechanical equipment. Sound-lock ves-  
tibules eliminate intrusive noise from a lobby and allow latecomers  
to enter without acoustic interference to the show. Carpeted aisles  
help reduce footfall noise. Noise from exterior environmental  
sources should also be considered. Avoid lightweight roofs, which  
will transmit rain noise.

The ceiling in an open-plan office is the most important surface to  
treat with highly efficient sound-absorbing material. Glass fiber  
ceiling panels often have NRC/SAA values of 0.85 or higher and are  
the preferred material for open-plan spaces. Regular mineral fiber  
acoustic panels have typical NRC/SAA values of about 0.55 to 0.65.  
Hard sound-reflective materials such as exposed structure or  
gypsum board will dramatically reduce privacy and increase  
annoying sound levels in an office. Most ceiling tile manufacturers  
provide extensive NRC/SAA data for their products and have spe-  
cial products with high absorptive performance for use in open-  
plan spaces. Materials must also be selected for their ability to  
reflect light.  
Most sound-absorbing materials are measured in a reverberation  
chamber in accordance with ASTM C 423, “Standard Test Method  
for Sound Absorption and Sound Absorption Coefficients by the  
Reverberation Room Method,” to determine their random inci-  
dence sound absorption coefficients. For office acoustics, the  
most useful measurement is the capability of a material to absorb  
sound at an incident angle of 40° to 60° from a flat ceiling and at  
frequencies weighted to reflect the relative contribution to speech  
intelligibility. A beneficial tool for evaluating the effectiveness of  
ceiling materials for sound absorption is the speech absorption  
coefficient \(SAC\).  
The following factors affect acoustic performance in open offices\:  
• Arrange offices so that entrances are offset, and eliminate  
direct line of sight or an open view through doorways from one  
workstation to another.  
• Workstations should be 8 to 10 ft. \(2.4 to 3 m\) apart so voice  
levels are adequately reduced over distance. Higher ceilings can  
help reduce noise transfer.  
• Light fixtures in the ceiling plane should not have hard lenses or  
be placed directly above a partition because the fixture can then  
act as a mirror for sound across the barrier.  
• Absorptive material may be necessary on some barriers or  
reflecting surfaces \(e.g., walls, file cabinets\).  
• Carpet helps reduce footfall and impact noise and is a great  
benefit in open offices.  
• Voice levels should be kept to a minimum; even the best acoustic  
treatments cannot prevent disturbances caused by loud voices  
and hands-free amplified telephone use.  
All the factors outlined above are interrelated. For example,  
doubling the distance between adjacent workstations will reduce  
a nearby conversation by 5 dBA, while raising the height of a 5-ft  
\(1.5-m\) barrier to 6 ft. \(1.8 m\) may reduce the sound path over the  
Because of the lateral configuration of the human ear, sound sig-  
nals that are slightly different in each ear allow the listener to  
hear an acoustic quality called spaciousness , which is highly  
desired for classical music. This sense of spaciousness can be  
enhanced if the distribution of sound through a large hall is dif-  
fused, enabling the ear to hear reflections from many facets of the  
side and rear walls. This diffusion can be enhanced by protrusions  
and angled surfaces on the side walls. Diffusion is also important  
for other musical applications. Sometimes spaciousness is also  
referred to as envelopment .  
Room volume and area of absorption can be calculated to predict  
reverberation times \(RTs\). The design factor affecting RT the most  
is ceiling height. The relationship between the volume of a hall and  
the number of seats is often a good approximation of sound quality  
in the room.  
In wide halls with high ceilings, seats in the center of the orchestra  
often suffer from lack of early reflections. Reflecting canopies or  
arrays over the front rows can bring reflected sound to these seat-  
ing areas, which otherwise may suffer from poor articulation.

Often seats at the rear of the balcony do not experience this  
problem, and these seats have excellent acoustics. This gives  
preference acoustically to rectangular and diamond-shaped halls.  
The range of reverberation times for each room type is a function  
of the room volume\: The larger the room volume, the closer is the  
distance to the longer end of the range. The smaller the room vol-  
ume, the closer is the distance to the shorter end of the range.  
Some considerations to keep in mind\:  
• Church reverberation requirements vary greatly based on size,  
room volume, and music style. Some contemporary services  
resemble folk rock concerts, while others have a cathedral-style  
liturgy with an organ.  
• Music recording is often done in studios similar to those used  
for speech recording, for future mixing. Some classical record-  
ing is done in rooms with higher reverberation times.

# RESILIENCE IN BUILDINGS OVERVIEW  
# OVERVIEW  
Natural and manmade hazardous events can impose a devastating  
cost upon society. As Figure 3.1 shows, the costs of some of these  
disasters in the United States alone can be staggering.  
Stakeholders of civil infrastructure have a vested interest in reduc-  
ing these costs by improving and maintaining operational and  
physical performance of facilities.  
Throughout history, infrastructure resilience has been defined in  
numerous ways, the most widely used and most objective was by  
the National Infrastructure Advisory Council \(NIAC\) in 2009, which  
states\:  
Infrastructure resilience is the ability to reduce the magni-  
tude and/or duration of disruptive events. The effectiveness  
of a resilient infrastructure or enterprise depends upon its  
ability to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, and/or rapidly recover  
from a potentially disruptive event.  
No city is immune to challenges, whether natural or manmade, and  
given the world’s growing population, more people than ever are in  
the potential path of catastrophe. Fortunately, cities can become  
resilient and withstand shock and stress if planned well. As  
conditions change over time, cities that are resilient can evolve  
in the face of disaster and stop failure from rippling through  
systems; they can reestablish function quickly and avoid long-term  
disruptions.  
This chapter explores different aspects of resilience management,  
to control and help reduce the rapidly increasing costs of manmade  
and natural hazards and ensure that civil infrastructure exhibits a  
high degree of resilience. A definition of resilience that incorpo-  
rates four components—robustness, resourcefulness, recovery,  
and redundancy—is presented and its manifestation in building  
systems is covered.  
Stakeholders of buildings stand to benefit from resilience manage-  
ment. Businesses locate where they can rely on critical infrastruc-  
ture. Communities that become resilient will increasingly attract  
businesses because executives know they can rely on the services  
and workforce availability, even in the face of disruptive events.  
Natural and manmade hazardous events are unpredictable, but  
they are still inevitable and impose a devastating cost to civil  
infrastructure. By improving and maintaining the operational and  
physical performance of our nation’s building stock, strategies for  
resilience can be developed.  
When planning and designing buildings, it is appropriate to try to  
mitigate the potential of the spiraling cost of operational failures  
by opting for more resilient performance through well-thought-out  
investments in better planning and designs. It no longer makes  
sense to wait until after a crisis to implement resilience efforts.  
Resiliency strategies for buildings should be discussed and imple-  
mented now, so that there is a greater chance of increased perfor-  
mance, not only today but for the future, benefiting all building  
stakeholders.

# COMPONENTS OF BUILDING RESILIENCE  
The National Infrastructure Advisory Council \(NIAC\) 2009 determined  
that resilience can be characterized by three key features\:  
Robustness\: the ability to maintain critical operations and func-  
tions in the face of crisis. This includes the building itself, the  
design of the infrastructure \(office buildings, power generation,  
distribution structures, bridges, dams, levees\), or in system  
redundancy and substitution \(transportation, power grid, com-  
munications networks\).  
Resourcefulness\: the ability to skillfully prepare for, respond to  
and manage a crisis or disruption as it unfolds. This includes  
identifying courses of action and business continuity planning;  
training; supply chain management; prioritizing actions to control  
and mitigate damage; and effectively communicating decisions.  
Rapid recovery\: the ability to return to and/or reconstitute normal  
operations as quickly and efficiently as possible after a disruption.  
Components \[of rapid recovery\] include carefully drafted contin-  
gency plans, competent emergency operations, and the means to  
get the right people and resources to the right places.  
Redundancy\: backup resources in case of failure.  
These four resilience features are simply called the 4Rs. Resilience  
is multidisciplinary and needs the cooperation of different disci-  
plines for successful outcomes. Without multidisciplinary coopera-  
tion and contributions, there cannot be successful or efficient  
resilient infrastructure.  
A beneficial illustration of resilience was introduced first by Mary  
Ellen Hynes \(2001\) and then by Bruneau, et al \(2003\). Figure 3.2  
shows graphically how to objectively estimate the resilience of an  
asset or community by using resilience charts.  
One of the objectives is to clarify distinctions and relationships  
between three of the emerging paradigms\: risk, resilience, and  
sustainability. First, risk is expressed as the relationship between  
a particular hazard \(or threat\) that might degrade the performance  
of the infrastructure under consideration and the consequences  
that might result from a degradation of performance \(Gutteling and  
Wiegman 1996, FEMA 2005, and NRC 2010\). Most professional  
industries, such as engineering, finance, insurance, and medicine,  
adopt a variant of this particular definition of risk \(Gutteling and  
Wiegman, 1996\). In the building/infrastructure community, FEMA  
\(2005\) uses an objective risk definition which states\:  
Risk rating = function \(Consequence, Threat,  
Vulnerability—C, T, V\)  
The type of risk function also depends on the desired degree of  
complexity of risk analysis.  
It was established earlier that a reasonable resilience definition  
relates resilience to robustness, resourcefulness, recovery, and  
redundancy \(the 4Rs\). It can be shown that the 4Rs can be recast  
as a subset of C, T, V. Ettouney and Alampalli, 2012a and 2012b,  
proposed a relationship similar to that shown in Figure 3.3.

There is an essential distinction between asset resilience and com-  
munity resilience. As the label implies, asset resilience is the  
resilience of a single asset. For immediate purposes, an asset is  
considered to be an individual building. Note that other types of  
assets are also feasible such as bridges, mass transit stations,  
transmission towers, or tunnels. DHS \(2009\) and the American  
Society of Civil Engineers \(ASCE\) Report Card \(2013\), each contain  
a comprehensive list of types of assets.  
Asset resilience is described using the resilience definition above  
with the 4Rs. Within an asset, different parameters \(sometimes  
referred to as considerations\) control asset resilience. These  
parameters can be categorized as components of one or more of  
the 4Rs. Table 3.6 shows a simplified example of building compo-  
nents and categorizations in an asset resilience setting. Note that  
Columns fit in more than one resilience component \(robustness  
and redundancy\). In addition to the categorizations of Table 3.5, a  
functional diagram, called a network or a graph, needs to be estab-  
lished. This network shows dependencies of different parameters.  
The dependencies are expressed by arrows from the controlling  
parameter to the dependent parameter. If there is no obvious  
dependence between two linked parameters, then a simple line  
connecting the two parameters is used. Figure 3.6 shows a simple  
network for asset resilience of a tall building. Capturing important  
parameters \(both operational and physical\) as well as their inter-  
dependencies as shown in Table 3.5 and Figure 3.6 are essential  
first steps for achieving successful asset resilience management.

We now turn our discussion to community resilience. As the name  
implies, a community is comprised of several assets \(nodes\) that  
are interconnected via links that may be assets themselves. The  
nodes and links constitute a community’s network. Community  
resilience is dependent on the resilience of the network’s individu-  
al asset components \(both nodes and links\). As an essential step  
of community resilience management, a greater understanding of  
the resilience of nodes and links is needed. In addition, community  
resilience will depend on the topology of the network and how dif-  
ferent nodes are linked together.  
The size of the community is completely subjective. A community  
could be a simple campus comprising a small number of buildings  
\(such as a small hospital or college\). A community could be a  
transportation network, a small town, a region, a state, or even a  
whole country. Each of the 4Rs of community resilience is a func-  
tion of all of the 4Rs of its nodes and links as well as the topology  
of the network. Figure 3.7 shows a simple resilience network for a  
small community.

# RESILIENCE IN BUILDINGS HAZARD-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
# HAZARD-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS  
Achieving resilience in the design of new facilities and the renova-  
tion of existing ones focuses on increasing the robustness of the  
structures and establishing the warranted redundancies needed to  
achieve the desired performance in response to hazards.  
Consideration of resourcefulness and recovery should also be part  
of the planning process although these resilience components are  
more directly related to operational programs. This section  
addresses design considerations to increase resilience primarily  
through strengthening and configuration to minimize the impact  
from natural and manmade hazard events.  
Durability , the ability to resist wear and decay, is to be lasting and  
enduring over time.  
Durability for buildings depends on the quality of the design and  
construction of the building. The physical condition of the building  
is, over time, dependent on the quality of the materials and sys-  
tems used and the nature of how all elements are combined and  
installed to resist degrading in its natural environment as well as  
during extraordinary events.  
Design strategies for durability look to these qualities and to  
anticipation of both normal and extraordinary events that might  
impact the viability of the building and its functions.  
Design strategies for long-term viability are built on the choices  
affecting the ability of the building or facility to remain functional  
over time.  
• Lessen the amount of required maintenance  
• Design to extraordinary events beyond code  
• Plan for upgrades and replacements  
Each building system is first considered individually and designed  
to stand alone, but also is designed to work together in a whole  
building system. Knowing the level to which each system is  
designed and knowing the vulnerabilities inherent in each is the  
basis for its use.

The assessment of each system informs the design on how best it  
can be integrated into the whole where the vulnerabilities of each  
system are taken into account.  
The goal for planning a resilient building is to design and construct  
integrated systems, to locate and protect critical elements of each  
system so as to enhance survivability, and facilitate maintenance  
and repair.  
estimates of the probability of damaging events and then balancing  
the probability of those events against the investment it might  
require to address such occurrences.  
Standards based on past performance and probability may not be  
adequate to address a rapidly changing climate or a sudden break  
from the “normal” past.  
A resilient design strategy for any building needs to assess its  
particular environment and if any of the potential climatic threats  
in that environment are likely to increase.  
Even the less than extraordinary events that degrade buildings may  
increase and result in an increased need to repair and maintain  
elements of the building and site. These should be considered dur-  
ing the design phase so as to mitigate possible degradation.  
Another aspect of resilience is the ability to maintain the technol-  
ogy of building functions. Critical design decisions include\:  
• Systems’ maintainability over time and ability to adjust to new  
and evolving systems  
• Ease of replacing critical elements of a system  
• Capability to add upgrades, or new systems  
Climate change and variability increase the probability of adverse  
conditions and events both in frequency and severity. Building  
design standards that address durability are based on the best  
# MAINTAINABILITY  
The relation between resilience and maintainability can be mea-  
sured on at least two scales. One is the ease and cost effective-  
ness of regular maintenance, and the other is the ability to restore  
and maintain a system after a damaging event.  
Design considerations for maintainability include\:  
• Standardization and availability of systems or components  
• Ease of access for normal maintenance  
• Access for major maintenance and replacement of components  
• Resilience of logistics affecting service, maintenance, and repair  
• Backup for inputs needed to operate systems, including energy,  
monitoring, control, and spare parts  
• Extent of inputs required for restoration and general maintenance  
Standalone buildings or systems may be less vulnerable to wide  
area disruptions and require little or no recovery from such events;  
but those same buildings may be less resilient in an event directly  
affecting that building. A balance must be struck between on-site  
resilience, which demands less of the surrounding community in  
recovery, and off-site resilience, which can support the recovery of  
each building.  
# SAFETY  
Protection from natural hazard events is broadly identified as  
“safety” and is analyzed by hazard type. The type of load created  
by the hazard requires different responses from the building to  
withstand a threat event.  
resistance of both wind and seismic loading is the presence of  
lateral load-resisting structural systems that are capable of  
withstanding the corresponding forces and moments and can  
transfer the accumulated effects to the foundation. While these  
lateral load-resisting systems must be strong enough to prevent  
material failure or connection dismemberment, they must also  
be stiff enough to limit lateral sway motions and to prevent  
secondary P-Delta effects from precipitating global instabilities.  
Building structures must therefore satisfy both strength and  
serviceability requirements.  
Buildings are required to withstand both gravity loads that act  
vertically and lateral loads that may either be in the form of  
wind pressures applied to the building envelope or base motions  
that generate inertial forces. Both types of these natural occur-  
rences are correlated by statistical studies to determine the  
magnitude as a function of likelihood \(or return period\). As  
would be expected, the moderate levels of such lateral load  
effects occur frequently with very short return periods but the  
extreme levels of these lateral load effects are relatively infre-  
quent. Because of this statistical variation in the magnitude of  
load effects, building codes provide both prescriptive and per-  
formance-based approaches to resist both moderate and  
extreme levels of these lateral load effects. Fundamental to the  
Wind loads are defined in terms of 3-second gust speeds and these  
velocities are related to design pressures. As wind gusts sweep  
across a landscape, caused by differential atmospheric pressures,  
they are influenced by the topography of the region and the den-  
sity of objects \(trees, buildings, etc.\) at the ground surface. Wind  
velocities are found to be fairly constant above a “gradient height”  
that is determined by the terrain’s exposure category, and drag  
effects reduce these velocities closer to the ground; the smoother  
the ground surface the lower the gradient height. Buildings are  
assigned risk categories based on the use and occupancy, and wind  
speed maps are assigned to each category along with a corre-  
sponding return period that ranges from once in 300 years for low  
hazard structures to once in 1700 years for assembly or essential  
structures. The wind speed maps account for the hurricane-prone  
regions along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and the specified veloci-  
ties are amplified accordingly.  
Wind speeds are calculated at the elevation of the building and  
are factored by the effects of topographic directionality and the  
openness of the building envelope. Pressures are applied to either  
the windward face as an inward load or to the roof, sides, and lee-  
ward faces as a suction load. Openings in the facade will produce  
either internal pressures or internal suctions. Two sets of forces are  
calculated based on the calculated wind pressures\: forces that are  
applied to the global lateral-load-resisting system and forces that are  
applied to local cladding and components. Globally, the net forces  
collected over the building surface are transferred through the floor  
diaphragms and these lateral loads are combined with the gravity  
loads when designing the lateral-load-resisting system. Locally,  
the cladding and component loads are used to design the facade  
elements.

# RESILIENCE IN BUILDINGS SAFETY  
Lateral-load-resisting systems may be composed of combinations  
of moment frames, braced frames, and shear walls. Moment  
frames rely on the interactive bending of beams and columns to  
develop the lateral stiffness, whereas shear walls behave as stiff  
beams cantilevered from the foundation. Shear walls tend to be  
significantly stiffer than moment frame buildings and in most  
cases buildings with significant shear wall systems are treated as  
“sway inhibited” structures. Moment frame construction tends to  
be less stiff and there is greater concern for secondary P-Delta  
effects.  
For rigid diaphragm buildings, such as concrete floor systems, the  
percentage of lateral force will be distributed to the various later-  
al-resisting components in proportion to the relative stiffness of  
the various lateral-resisting elements. For flexible diaphragm  
buildings, such as timber construction, the percentage of lateral  
force will be distributed in proportion to the tributary areas that  
are exposed to wind.

Seismic forces are induced by the building components as the  
building’s inertia resists the lateral base motions. These inertial  
forces are related to the base acceleration through Newton’s  
Second Law of Motion \(force equals the product of mass and accel-  
eration\). Similar to wind loads, seismic base acceleration maps  
define a short period \(0.2 second\) and long period \(1 second\)  
ground motion parameter. The maps are constructed to provide a  
uniform probability of hazard, corresponding to a 1 percent prob-  
ability of collapse in 50 years. These ground motion parameters are  
multiplied by site coefficient factors, based on site classification,  
that either amplify or reduce the intensity of design ground accel-  
eration. Since the induced seismic force depends to a great extent  
on the structure’s frequency of vibration, the factored ground  
motion parameters are used to develop a design response spectra  
that defines acceleration as a function of building period. In gen-  
eral, the design response spectra is constant for relatively stiff  
buildings, decays inversely proportional to the building period for  
more massive or more flexible buildings, and decays inversely  
proportional to the square of the building period for very flexible or  
very massive buildings.  
Building occupancy types, ranging from low-hazard to assembly or  
essential structures, are used to define importance factors and  
risk categories. The importance factors are used to scale the inten-  
sity of the spectral values and the risk categories are used to  
define both the analytical methods and the structural systems that  
may be permitted for a range of building heights. Since earth-  
quakes are extraordinary events that vary in intensity, buildings  
are expected to be undamaged in response to relatively low-  
intensity events but are permitted to sustain modest amounts of  
damage in response to much greater magnitudes of ground  
motion. In order to enable buildings to sustain these modest  
amounts of damage, they are required to adhere to relatively strict  
rules governing structural systems and detailing requirements. By  
adhering to these rules, the buildings will deform in a ductile man-  
ner that will permit large inelastic deformations that dissipate  
considerable amounts of energy prior to structural failure.  
In order to minimize stress concentrations and eccentric load  
paths, both vertical and torsional irregularities should be mini-  
mized to the greatest extent possible. Similarly, the greatest uni-  
formity in both mass and stiffness are desirable attributes for  
buildings that may have to resist seismic forces. The Figures 3.9  
and 3.10 images depict both a damaging torsional mode resulting  
from a horizontal irregularity and a soft story failure resulting from  
a vertical change in story stiffness.

The different structural system types—bearing walls, building  
frame, moment frame, dual system secondary moment frames  
\(SMF\), dual intermediate moment frames \(IMF\), wall frame, and  
cantilever column—are permitted for specific risk categories and  
building heights with corresponding response modification coeffi-  
cients and deflection amplification factors. In this manner, the  
appropriate level of ductile inelastic deformation is permitted in  
response to the most extreme ground motion. Moment-resisting  
frames, braced frames, and shear wall systems are depicted in  
Figure 3.8. Detailing of the connections, splices, and other struc-  
tural conditions are required to follow preapproved and tested  
practices. Examples of seismic connections for concrete and steel  
moment frames are shown in Figure 3.11 \(Aghayere & Vigil, 2015\).  
The rigorous analytical methodology and preapproved detailing is  
the most effective means of designing structures to withstand  
extraordinary events and to make sure the details deliver the  
desired performance.

# RESILIENCE IN BUILDINGS SAFETY  
It is essential to provide a continuous path of resistance from roof  
to foundation to dissipate both lateral and uplift forces. Connections  
along this load path will guarantee uninterrupted resistance.  
Seismic and wind forces are transferred from the roof diaphragm  
to shear walls and through the walls into the ground at the founda-  
tion. Shear walls resist horizontal forces in the roof and floor dia-  
phragms and so must be connected to them. It is important to  
apply wall sheathing to the full wall height, nailing it to the top  
plate, blocking, or rim joist, as well as to the mud sill or bottom  
plate. Shear wall height/width ratios are an important consider-  
ation; consult a structural engineer for their design. The details  
illustrated show several connection paths; for each specific design,  
a structural engineer familiar with seismic and wind-resistant  
construction should be consulted. Many of the requirements for  
high-wind situations apply to seismic loading as well, except in  
shear wall design.  
In regions of moderate to high seismicity \(earthquakes\), building  
codes and international standards require installation of seismic  
recording instrumentation for certain types of both new and exist-  
ing buildings. Seismic recording instrumentation consists of two  
types of sensor equipment\:  
• Strong motion accelerograph  
• An accelerometer  
This instrumentation is deployed at strategic locations within a  
building structure to provide recorded data of the building’s  
response to earthquake ground shaking at the building site. Figure  
3.13 charts typical recorded ground motions at a building’s roof,  
ground floor, free-field, and bedrock.

In certain locations, buildings of a certain size or height may  
require earthquake recording instrumentation. Municipalities may  
further require additional instrumentation, including complete  
strong motion accelerograph specifications for complete systems,  
installation, data retrieval, and servicing.  
Implementation of a code-mandated or voluntary seismic instru-  
mentation program is normally the responsibility of the building  
owner, although federal and state programs, including the U.S.  
Geological Survey \(USGS\) and the California Geological Survey  
\(CGS\), may provide assistance with implementation and mainte-  
nance of these programs.  
Energy utilities, hospitals, and universities have developed their  
own specifications and procedures to implement and maintain these  
programs. Maintenance of instrumentation and processing of earth-  
quake response data is normally the responsibility of the enforce-  
ment agency or a designated agent, such as the USGS and CGS.  
In 1998, the historic Court of Appeals Building in San Francisco,  
California, was rehabilitated and retrofitted with a base-isolation  
system. The U.S. Geological Survey \(USGS\), with the cooperation of  
the U.S. General Services Administration \(GSA\), installed a total of  
36 channels of accelerometers with state-of-the-art digital record-  
ing capability. The dense array of recorders will provide vital data  
on the performance of the isolators and the response of the super-  
structure to future earthquakes. A free-field station has been  
deployed close to the building to provide key input data for evalua-  
tion of structures in the proximity of the Court of Appeals Building  
and to contribute to the assessment of the variation of ground  
motion within downtown San Francisco.  
The primary purpose of recording ground motion data from build-  
ings and other instrumented structures is to facilitate analytical  
investigations. This analysis correlates actual building perfor-  
mance with expected performance. This information can be used to  
improve building codes and better predict the response of struc-  
tures to earthquake ground motions, resulting in fewer losses of  
life and property. Such information can be used to provide critical  
time-dependent information to agencies responsible for earth-  
quake preparedness and emergency response in large urban  
areas. Data can also be utilized to greatly reduce the time and  
extent of post earthquake building damage inspections. Automated  
procedures can then be utilized for rapid analysis of recorded sen-  
sor data prior to building inspections regarding the degree of  
damage immediately following a damaging earthquake.  
A seismic instrumentation program should be configured to pro-  
vide enough information to reconstruct the response of a building  
in enough detail to compare the mathematically modeled response  
with laboratory simulations and tests. The goal is to improve math-  
ematical prediction models and provide data to assess reasons for  
damage to the structure. Nearby free-field and ground-level earth-  
quake response recordings will further support comparisons with  
building response recordings to understand effects of soil-struc-  
ture interaction. A complete set of recordings should provide use-  
ful data to verify analytical models, correlate observed damage,  
improve building codes, and facilitate retrofit strategies. The pri-  
mary goal of seismic instrumentation programs is to assess how  
actual buildings and structural and nonstructural components  
respond to earthquakes.  
Local codes vary and should be consulted for requirements of  
building information schemes. The most basic scheme usually  
consists of three accelerograph sensors placed at the top, middle,  
and ground or foundation levels of a building. Because of the lim-  
ited number of sensors in this configuration, only enough data is  
retrieved to serve as a basis to monitor, rather than fully analyze,  
the building’s response.  
A more extensive type of instrumentation scheme includes at least  
three horizontal accelerometers corresponding to two translation-  
al and one rotational degree-of-freedom. These horizontal acceler-  
ometers are required for each of the first four fundamental modes  
of vibration of the structure, resulting in a total of 12 accelerome-  
ters. If significant vertical motion and rocking is expected, at least  
three additional vertical accelerometers are required at the base-  
ment level.  
Additional extensive instrumentation schemes can be used for  
special-purpose buildings, such as structures with flexible dia-  
phragms, or base-isolated buildings. To make full use of the  
recorded data and accurately correlate the responses of an instru-  
mented building, recording sensors must be synchronized with  
high-precision digital recording devices. This allows postprocess-  
ing data to reconstruct the overall behavior of the structure.  
Seismic instrumentation equipment includes accelerographs,  
accelerometers, and cabling and digital recorders\:  
Accelerographs \: Triaxial accelerographs, analog or digital, are the  
most widely deployed instruments by national and international  
organizations. A triaxial accelerograph contains two orthogonal  
horizontal accelerometers and one vertical accelerometer with-  
in the unit, which also houses the recording components.  
Accelerometers \: New installations normally consist of force-bal-  
ance accelerometers with digital recording transducers, avail-  
able in uniaxial, biaxial, or triaxial models. Sensors are usually  
installed in the building structure and in the free-field or down-  
hole adjacent to the structure. The accelerometers are bolted to  
the building frame or floor, and data is transmitted to a central  
recording location by shielded cable. Triaxial accelerometers are  
the preferred models, as they include three force-balance accel-  
erometer modules mounted orthogonally in one package.  
Sensors typically allow for recording ranges of plus/minus 0.25  
to plus/minus 4 g, with recording bandwidth ranges from DC to  
200 Hz.  
Cabling and digital recorders \: Accelerometers are interconnected  
by cabling to centrally located digital recorders for synchronized  
timing. There should be a junction box at each location where the  
main cable breaks out, to pick up more accelerometers. The  
junction box should be sized according to the number and size of  
the cables, which will be connected in and/or passing through it.  
The digital recorder should be located such that it is the shortest  
possible run to an outside wall, to facilitate installation of a GPS  
option. Digital recording systems can download data to a laptop,  
or transfer by modem or other communications media.

# RESILIENCE IN BUILDINGS SAFETY  
Buildings are not typically designed to resist tornados; however,  
buildings in tornado-prone areas often provide “safe rooms” or  
shelters as areas of refuge. The concept of shelter-in-place  
requires sufficient space internal to the building, away from the  
exterior facade, for the building population to assemble. Interior  
partitions should be constructed of debris-mitigating materials,  
preferably reinforced block walls.

Flooding hazards are associated with water damage and hydro-  
static loading on exposed surfaces. The base flood elevation \(BFE\)  
defines the elevation of the flooding, including wave height, with a  
1 percent change of exceedance in any year and the corresponding  
design flood elevation is provided in flood hazard maps produced  
by the regional authority having jurisdiction. Flood insurance rate  
maps \(FIRMs\) are produced by the Federal Insurance and  
Mitigation Administration to define special flood hazard areas and  
risk premium zones. Waterproofing must be comprehensive up to  
the design flood elevation in order to protect property within the  
building. The structure must be able to withstand the hydrostatic  
loads, hydrodynamic loads, wave loads, and debris impact loads.  
Hydrostatic forces are based on the weight of standing water that  
increases with depth, and hydrodynamic forces account for the  
effects of moving water. Wave loads are associated with the  
periodic cresting and falling of the water surface; these waves may  
“break” against the structure. As upstream debris from damaged  
structures is swept up in the flood waters, downstream buildings  
become vulnerable to debris impact.  
Design level flood loads are based on hurricane-generated storm  
tides but these loads only apply when the water level exceeds the  
local ground elevation. As a result, the statistical characteristics of  
flood loads depend on the ground elevation. Flood loads may be  
applied laterally to the vertical surfaces that resist the water pres-  
sure and as uplift to horizontal surfaces beneath the design flood  
elevation. Walls and slabs subjected to flood loads must be ade-  
quately reinforced and braced to resist the resulting pressures.  
Making a building flood resistant involves the use of resilient mate-  
rials, which must be resistant to excessive humidity and require no  
more than cleaning and cosmetic repair following three days \(or  
more\) contact with flood waters. Some of the flood-resistant  
materials include glazed brick, concrete, concrete block, glass  
block, stone with waterproof grout, naturally decay-resistant lum-  
ber, marine grade plywood, and cement board. A more detailed list  
of flood damage–resistant materials may be found in FEMA  
Technical Bulletin 2. All structural interfaces below the flood level,  
such as building foundations and equipment, must be adequately  
anchored to resist buoyancy uplift forces and lateral movement.  
Mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems must be moved  
above the flood level so as to protect heating, ventilation, plumbing  
appliances, ducts, electrical panels, meters, and switches.  
Waterproof enclosures and coatings may be required where sensi-  
tive equipment cannot be moved.  
In addition to flood waters inundating a property and the forces  
they may impose, flooding often causes sanitary sewer lines and  
wastewater systems to back-up and cause additional damage.  
Backflow and automatic shutoff valves must be installed on any  
pipes that leave the building or are connected to equipment below  
the base flood elevation. Fuel supply lines must be equipped with  
float-operated automatic shutoff valves.

Fire is among the most common catastrophic hazards in the United  
States. According to National Fire Protection Association \(NFPA\), in  
2013 U.S. fire departments responded to over a million fires that  
caused over 3000 civilian fire fatalities, nearly 16,000 civilian fire  
injuries, and an estimated \$11.5 billion in direct property loss.  
Passive and automatic fire protection systems are effective in  
detecting, containing, controlling, and extinguishing a fire in its early  
stages. Designers must take an integrated systems approach to  
address the four primary sources of fire\: natural, manmade, wildfire,  
and incidental. While code compliance will protect against loss of life  
and limit fire impact on the community, it doesn’t necessarily protect  
the building assets and, as a result, additional considerations  
should be integrated with the minimum required fire safety mea-  
sures. The inclusion of a fire protection engineer on the design team  
will produce a performance-based design approach that addresses  
both the code-mandated requirements and project-specific criteria. The  
Society of Fire Protection Engineers \(SFPE\) and NFPA published  
the Engineering Guidelines to Performance-Based Fire Protection  
Analysis and Design of Buildings.  
Fire protection involves the construction type and size of a project,  
exposures and separation requirements, fire ratings of materials  
and systems, occupancy types, interior finishes, and exit stairway  
enclosures. Additional considerations are the remoteness of exit  
stairways; exit discharge locations; areas of refuge; accessibility  
of exits; and fire detection, notification, and system survivability.  
The design of fire suppression systems addresses the adequacy of  
water supply, automatic fire extinguishing systems, standpipes,  
and fire department hose outlets. Emergency power, lighting, and  
exit signage must be survivable.  
Fire protection engineering is a multidisciplinary field that coordi-  
nates mechanical \(sprinklers, standpipes, smoke control\),  
electrical \(fire alarm\), architectural \(egress systems\), and struc-  
tural \(fire-resistant design\) professionals in a comprehensive  
strategy. In addition to satisfying prescriptive codes and stan-  
dards, the fire protection engineer will use equivalency or alter-  
nate methods to portions of the building that achieve the fire  
safety goals while preserving project-specific aesthetics and  
functionality.  
Sustained and prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures  
weakens structural materials and precipitates collapse as shown  
in Figure 3.17 \(Buchanan, 2001\). Fireproofing materials are there-  
fore used to insulate the structural materials to minimize the heat  
gain and to delay the weakening of the structure. Steel is most  
susceptible to elevated temperatures and fireproofing materials  
may be cementitious \(such as concrete encasement\), board systems  
\(such as calcium silicate and gypsum\), spray-on systems, and  
intumescent paints. Each system has advantages and disadvantages,

which dictate their use. However, the effectiveness of each system  
is established through extensive testing in fire labs under con-  
trolled conditions. Hollow steel sections can be filled with concrete  
to improve fire performance and in rare occasions, hollow sections  
have been filled with water. Although concrete materials are less  
vulnerable to sustained heat, concrete spall can leave reinforcing  
steel exposed to sustained high temperatures and weaken the  
structure. Adequate thicknesses of concrete cover will limit the  
potential for reinforcing steel to be damaged before a fire can be  
brought “under control.” Examples of different fireproofing details  
are shown in Figure 3.18 \(Buchanan, 2001\).

# SECURITY  
A physical attack against a facility, its assets, or its occupants, may  
potentially disrupt building operations and functionality. The dura-  
tion and magnitude of disruption will depend on the type of attack  
\(vandalism up through weapons of mass destruction\), the areas/  
functions/personnel impacted, and the mitigation measures in  
place at the time of the attack. A facility may also experience col-  
lateral effects of an attack on a nearby facility, including a poten-  
tially similar level of disruption. Inclusion of appropriate security  
and hardening features into the site and facility design will aid in  
providing robustness against such attacks, resulting in a more  
resilient facility.  
Design provisions should also be considered for maintaining an  
appropriate post-event security posture for the facility after a  
disruptive event has occurred \(including deliberate physical attack,  
accident, or natural hazard\).  
Explosions can be generated from a variety of sources and condi-  
tions, and can be intentional \(e.g., terrorist attack\) or accidental  
\(e.g., chemical plant malfunction\). An explosive event results in a  
blast wave or shock front that expands outward in all directions at  
high velocity that will produce time-variant pressure loads on any  
surface that is directly or indirectly exposed to the blast wave as it  
expands. These loads can vary significantly across a building’s  
exterior surfaces based on the size, geometry, and location of the  
building. Explosions can also be either external or internal to the  
building. The two must be treated differently, as effects from  
reflections and gas pressure buildups are typically more pro-  
nounced in an interior blast event.  
There are three ways to approach blast protection for buildings\:  
• Reduce the blast loading on the facility  
• Increase standoff to the facility, and/or  
• Decrease the design basis explosive charge size  
• Structurally harden the facility  
• Accept a higher level of damage/risk for the facility  
One or more of these constraints are typically fixed for design  
projects, which limits available options for blast resistance.  
Blast design considerations for exterior explosive threats include\:  
• Perimeter protection \(standoff distance, vehicle barrier design,  
screening\)  
• Structural response \(walls, slabs, roofs, frames/columns,  
foundation\)  
• Windows \(glass, frames, and attachments\)  
• Fragments \(primary and secondary\)  
Blast design considerations for interior explosive threats include\:  
• Confined volume  
• Location \(basement, exterior room\)  
• Windows \(glass, frames, and attachments\)  
• Structural response \(walls, slabs, framing/columns\)  
• Proximity to critical systems or personnel  
• Fragments, fire, smoke damage

# RESILIENCE IN BUILDINGS SECURITY  
Provide at least one bay of standoff between critical infrastructure  
systems \(fire, water, power, communications, alarms, etc.\) and  
vulnerable locations such as the building exterior, lobbies, mail  
rooms, loading docks, and the like.  
Infrastructure systems should be provided in hardened utility ris-  
ers. Isolate critical infrastructure systems from riser walls that  
may be exposed to either direct or indirect \(infill\) blast loads.  
Perimeter protection is the first line of defense in providing secu-  
rity for a facility. It is used to define boundaries, provide protection,  
and deter or delay unauthorized access. In addition to defining the  
physical limits of a facility and controlling access to it, a perimeter  
barrier also creates a physical and psychological deterrent to  
unauthorized entry. It delays intrusion into an area, making the  
possibility of detection and apprehension more likely. It also aids  
security forces in controlling access and assists in directing the  
flow of people and vehicles through designated entrances.  
Ballistic-resistant design considerations include\:  
• Underwriters Laboratory \(UL\) or National Institute of Justice  
\(NIJ\) rated window glazing \(typically several inches thick with  
multiple glass, polycarbonate, and laminate layers\)  
• UL or NIJ rated doors  
• Tested steel inserts placed in window and doorframes  
• Wall panels/materials tested to the desired level of protection  
with detailing for panel-to-panel seams. Note that most stan-  
dard or layered building materials do not currently have stan-  
dard ratings for ballistic resistance.  
Vendors of ballistic mitigation products should provide test results  
demonstrating that the design/product will perform as intended.

No construction can be truly bulletproof, but ballistics-resistant  
construction is possible. Protected areas should be designed to  
withstand a level of attack based on the threat at that location, in  
particular the type of arms expected. Each component in a ballis-  
tics-resistant assembly must be ballistics-resistant; there can be  
no weak links and no gaps. Therefore, it is essential to consult a  
specialist in ballistics-resistant construction.  
Effective protection combines ballistics-resistant assemblies with  
appropriate detection, alarm, communication, escape, and retalia-  
tion capabilities. The complete ballistics-resistant environment  
makes it possible for personnel to escape, retaliate against attack,  
summon help, and defend themselves against the threat of gunfire,  
flame, and chemical or mechanical attack.

These guidelines apply to security doors and frame assemblies\:  
• The entire unit should be certified as a ballistics-resistant  
assembly by an independent testing laboratory.  
• Ballistics-resistant doors are heavier than regular doors, so the  
frame and hinges must be reinforced.  
• The frame must be constructed of ballistics-resistant material  
equivalent to that of the door itself. A proper fit between the  
door and the frame is required to prevent gaps that could permit  
ballistic penetration. Ideally, the door and frame should be sup-  
plied by the manufacturer as a single unit.  
• Use of appropriate hardware is important. The lockset should be  
mortised with 5/8-in. minimum throw on the latch bolt and be  
thoroughly armored to prevent the door from unlatching after  
assault.  
• The door should be equipped with a heavy-duty closer, to ensure  
it closes completely.  
Similar guidelines apply to ballistics-resistant window assemblies\:  
• The entire unit should be certified as a ballistics-resistant  
assembly by an independent testing laboratory.  
• All elements in an assembly must be ballistics-resistant, includ-  
ing voice communication equipment and trays.  
• The window frame must be ballistics-resistant, as well as sub-  
stantial enough to retain the glazing material under the impact  
of a projectile.  
• The window should be designed so that the frame and the glass  
form an integral unit.

showing compliance with the desired level of protection. Systems  
validated through testing should be installed using the configura-  
tion under which they were tested.

The Target Stores data hack in 2013 brought increased attention to  
the network connectivity of facilities/buildings operations and  
maintenance vendors, the organization’s business IT systems, and  
the facility/building control systems.  
Buildings are increasingly relying on building control systems with  
embedded communications technology, with such technology  
enabled via the Internet. These systems provide critical services  
that allow a building to meet the functional and operational needs  
of building occupants, but they can also be easy targets for hackers  
and people with malicious intent. Attackers can exploit these sys-  
tems to gain unauthorized access to facilities; be used as an entry  
point to traditional informational technology \(IT\) systems and data;  
cause physical destruction of building equipment; and expose an  
organization to significant financial obligations to contain and  
eradicate malware or recover from a cyber-event.  
The facility/building control systems such as the Building  
Automation Systems \(BAS\), Energy Management Systems \(EMS\),  
Physical Security Access Control Systems \(PACS\), and Fire Alarm  
Systems \(FAS\) are just beginning to be considered as potential  
hacking points into an organization. These control systems are  
often referred to as Operational Technologies \(OT\) and use a com-  
bination of traditional IT protocols such as TCP and UDP, and unique  
protocols such as Modbus, BACnet, LonTalk, and DNP 3 to com-  
municate with the sensors, devices, and actuators.  
IT is about data; OT is about controlling machines and OT is increas-  
ingly becoming more Internet Protocol \(IP\)-based. The Internet of  
Everything, Smart Grid, Smart Cities, Smart Buildings, and Smart  
Cars are redefining the boundary between IT and OT. As the IT and  
OT systems have converged, so have the risk and vulnerabilities of  
hacking and using the OT systems as a point of entry and then  
pivoting up the network and taking control of other system assets.  
The National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) has  
been a primary source of IT cyber standards and guides. The NIST  
SP 800–37 and NIST SP 800–53 publications, the SANS Top Twenty  
controls, and ISO standards have been used by both government  
and industry as IT best practices for many years.

# SUSTAINABILITY  
Sustainability focuses on decreasing the environmental impact of a  
building’s construction and operation. That focus results in design  
strategies that decrease overall energy and material use and  
incorporate renewable resources wherever possible. Sustainability  
can play an important part in overall resilience by improving the  
ability of buildings to withstand threats, and recover from damag-  
ing events.  
Reducing energy and other resource consumption and waste gen-  
eration during the building process and in building operation  
reduces the impact on the environment and contributes positively  
to sustainability of the design.  
Design considerations\:  
• Lower energy demands to decrease size and vulnerability of  
supporting infrastructure  
• Prioritize energy use to aid response and recovery from damage  
• Renewable materials that lessen the impact of providing materi-  
als for repair and restoration  
• Renewable and recyclable materials to lessen the impact of  
disposal and replacement  
• Maximize use of available natural resources.  
Sustainability strategies can be cross-purposed with resilience  
strategies in many aspects of building and site design. Site selec-  
tion and design are important aspects of both sustainable and  
resilient design.  
Design considerations\:  
• Avoid areas and sites of greater environmental vulnerability  
from water, fire, and wind threats.  
• Maintain natural barriers and systems that prevent damage  
from environmental threats.  
• Implement water management and natural water flow and  
drainage to both lessen environmental impact and to protect  
buildings from such events.  
• Install renewable on-site energy production to maintain  
operations.  
• Employ water and rainwater reuse and recycling to enhance  
potable and non-potable availability pre- and post-event.  
• Use natural systems to improve the building’s ability to recover  
operations.

# RESILIENCE IN BUILDINGS GOOD PRACTICES  
# GOOD PRACTICES  
Design strategies that not only increase robustness but also facili-  
tate incorporation of resourcefulness and planning for recovery  
and warranted redundancy should be implemented. In some cases  
these strategies are simply achieved through effective configura-  
tion and use of site and building features. In other cases, more  
extensive additions of systems are required.  
Resilience is a strategy to enhance the ability of a building, facility,  
or community to both prevent damage and to recover from damage.  
Each building has some particular function for which it is designed.  
Each function, each particular tenant, has a set of requirements and  
support systems necessary for that function. Attention should be  
paid to those particular needs in arriving at the specific resilience  
strategy and design. Achieving resilience for tenants will involve a  
combination of physical characteristics of the building that deter-  
mine its ability to withstand disruptive events and programs and  
procedures that minimize impact and enable an appropriately rapid  
return to operations. An effective building design should anticipate  
and incorporate both types of resilience achievement elements.  
Some of the important functional and operational factors affecting  
the resilience strategy are\:  
• Importance of the building’s function to the community  
• Role the building function fills in the institution or business in  
which it is involved  
• Effect of damage and recovery on the building’s surrounding  
neighbors and environment  
• Economic importance of timely recovery of the building’s operation  
Siting and layout should also account for potential natural hazards  
that may impact the site such as flooding and wildfire, high wind  
debris from adjacent sites, as well as potential off-site accident  
hazards such as hazardous substance release or explosions that  
may impact the site, including any compounded impact from com-  
bined hazards.  
Building siting and layout must also consider expedient access to  
the site and the facility by first responders such as the fire depart-  
ment, police, and medical response vehicles and personnel, includ-  
ing access to applicable critical infrastructure to support their  
individual missions.  
Defensive locations for critical utilities and backup systems should  
be selected. Defensive locations should be considered for  
protection from manmade threats, natural hazards, and potential  
accidents with a goal of maintaining post-event operability, or  
rapid restoration of services based on the specific needs of the  
facility. Redundant utility feeds to the site \(power, water, communi-  
cations, gas, etc.\) should be used to the greatest extent possible.  
Site considerations should also include egress pathways and areas  
of refuge for building evacuees, including multiple physically sepa-  
rated locations with appropriate standoff distances. Elimination of  
line-of-sight targeting for ballistic protection should be considered  
in the design. Design in urban areas presents challenges in these  
approaches.  
When designing for resilience, site selection must also consider  
the level of resilience of the surrounding community for the pro-  
posed site, particularly with regard to basic infrastructure and  
services such as transportation and deliveries, public and private  
utilities, and post-event availability of building tenant employees  
who reside in the surrounding community. For most facilities, pro-  
longed outages and shortages in the surrounding communities will  
impact building resilience from a recovery perspective.  
Perimeter protection passive design features are used to control  
pedestrian and vehicle access to the site. Multiple methods can be  
used to accomplish this for a variety of configurations and rating  
levels\:  
• Fixed bollards; Provide vehicle control and enforced vehicle  
standoff, but are ineffective for pedestrian control.  
• Fencing\: Provides vehicle and pedestrian control, as well as  
enforced vehicle standoff when integrated with a vehicle cable  
system or similar measure.  
• Fixed barriers\: Provide vehicle control and enforced vehicle  
standoff; level of pedestrian control varies widely based on type  
and configuration.  
• Curbs\: Provide a low level of vehicle control and nonenforced  
vehicle standoff, but are ineffective for pedestrian control.  
• Street furniture, lampposts, and retaining walls built to with-  
stand vehicle impacts  
• Boulder fields, ha-ha walls, berms, tree cover, and other land-  
scape features  
• Water retention ponds, fountains, bioswales and other water  
features, either decorative or part of a water management  
system.  
Redundancy, structural and facade hardening, Crime Prevention  
Through Environmental Design \(CPTED\), and locations of critical  
systems within and around the building or site should also be  
considered as passive design measures. Structural and facade  
hardening for blast resistance are often sufficient to mitigate many  
natural hazard threats.  
Passive design measures should also include appropriate anchor-  
age and attachment of exterior critical infrastructure systems for  
natural hazards that may impact the facility.  
Building siting and layout should use a defense-in-depth approach  
against physical attack which considers concentric and progressive  
levels of defense, implemented through a combination of physical  
attributes \(setback, hardening, access, avenues of approach, etc.\),  
technology \(CCTV, alarms, etc.\), and planned operational processes  
for the facility. The goal is effective threat deterrence, detection,  
delay, response, and, finally, physical denial in the case of the  
occurrence of an undesirable event.  
Passive measures developed to provide protection for building  
personnel, property, equipment, and operations against potential  
manmade threats and natural hazards that may test a building’s  
resilience include the effective use of architecture, lighting, land-  
scaping, and other building and site features specifically designed to\:  
• Deter threats  
• Deny threats  
• Mitigate the impact of threats  
Active measures developed to provide protection for building per-  
sonnel, property, equipment, and operations against potential  
threats and natural hazards that may test a building’s resilience  
include the effective use of tested systems, equipment, and tech-  
nologies specifically designed to\:  
• Deter threats  
• Detect/report threats  
• Deny threats  
• Respond to threats

Active design components selected to provide these functions  
include\:  
• Electronic security and surveillance systems/networks \(CCTV  
cameras, monitoring stations, etc.\)  
• Electronic access control systems \(card readers, biometric read-  
ers, electromagnetic locks, intrusion detection systems, etc.\)  
• Electronic notification systems \(annunciators, duress buttons,  
radios, etc.\)  
• Pedestrian and vehicle access infrastructure \(turnstiles, doors,  
gates, mantraps, portals, active vehicle barriers, etc.\)  
• Standby emergency power with auto transfer switch and on-site  
fuel storage  
• Wireless backup for landline communications  
• Sump pumps for submerged areas containing critical functions  
In assessing the importance of continued operations during  
design, tenant use should be paramount, as various locations  
throughout the building may have different needs regarding con-  
tinued operations. As part of the planning and design process,  
evaluating the benefits of building resilience based on risk and  
continuity of operations should be performed. As noted earlier,  
this can be done using the DHS IRVS tool. Design considerations  
include\:  
• Evaluating needs for tenant-specific operations  
• Identifying resiliency options to maintain mission-critical func-  
tions for each tenant  
• Quantifying impact to each tenant from loss of partial or full  
operational functionality, including financial impact, reputation/  
political impact, and others  
• Consideration of cascading impacts to external customers from  
loss of tenant operations  
To maintain continued operability of the building post-event, or  
resumption of building operations, the building owner should be  
prepared to obtain MOUs/MOAs with service providers regarding  
priority of service and potential work-arounds to maintain/restore  
service.  
# CRIME PREVENTION  
Security design and access control is more than bars on windows, a  
security guard booth, a camera, or a wall. Crime prevention involves  
the systematic integration of design, technology, and operation for  
the protection of three critical assets—people, information, and  
property. Protection of these assets is a concern and should be  
considered throughout the design and construction process.  
The most efficient, least expensive way to provide security is dur-  
ing the design process. Designers who are called on to address  
security and crime concerns must be able to determine security  
requirements, must know security technology, and must under-  
stand the architectural implications of security needs.  
The process of designing security into architecture is known as  
“crime prevention through environmental design” \(CPTED\). It  
involves designing the built environment to reduce the opportunity  
for, and fear of, stranger-to-stranger predatory crime. This  
approach to security design is different from traditional crime  
prevention practice, which focuses on denying access to a crime  
target with barrier techniques, such as locks, alarms, fences, and  
gates. CPTED takes advantage of opportunities for natural access  
control, surveillance, and territorial reinforcement. It is possible  
for natural and normal uses of the environment to meet the same  
security goals as physical and technical protection methods.  
CPTED strategies are implemented by\:  
Electronic methods\: Electronic access and intrusion detection,  
electronic surveillance, electronic detection, and alarm and  
electronic monitoring and control  
Architectural methods\: Architectural design and layout, site  
planning and landscaping, signage, and circulation control  
Organizational methods\: Manpower, police, security guards, and  
neighborhood watch programs

Concepts involved in crime prevention through environmental  
design are described below.  
Oscar Newman coined the expression “defensible space” as a  
term for a range of mechanisms, real and symbolic barriers,  
strongly defined areas of influence, and improved opportunities for  
surveillance that combine to bring the environment under the  
control of its residents.

# RESILIENCE IN BUILDINGS CRIME PREVENTION  
Natural access control involves decreasing opportunities for crime  
by denying access to crime targets and creating a perception of  
risk in offenders. It is accomplished by designing streets, side-  
walks, entrances, and neighborhood gateways to mark public  
routes, and by using structural elements to discourage access to  
private areas.  
A design concept intended to make intruders easily observable,  
natural surveillance is promoted by features that maximize visibil-  
ity of people, parking areas, and entrances. Examples are doors  
and windows that look onto streets and parking areas, pedestrian-  
friendly sidewalks and streets, front porches, and adequate night-  
time lighting.  
Physical design can create or extend a sphere of influence. In this  
setting, users develop a sense of territorial control, while potential  
offenders perceive this control and are discouraged from their  
criminal intentions. Territorial reinforcement is promoted by fea-  
tures that define property lines and distinguish private spaces from  
public spaces, such as landscape plantings, pavement design,  
gateway treatments, and fences.  
It is important to maintain neighborhoods and residences, and  
keep security components in good working order. Equipment and  
materials used in a dwelling should be designed or selected with  
safety and security in mind.  
Legitimate activity for a space or dwelling is encouraged through  
the use of natural surveillance and lighting, and architectural  
design that clearly defines the purpose of the structure or space.  
Crime prevention and design strategies can discourage illegal  
activity and protect a property from chronic problem activity.  
• Define parking lot entrances with curbs, landscaping, and/or  
architectural design; block dead-end areas with a fence or  
gate.  
• Common building entrances should have locks that automati-  
cally lock when the door closes.  
• Limit access to the building to no more than two points.  
Designing CPTED and security features into buildings and  
neighborhoods can reduce opportunities for, and vulnerability to,  
criminal behavior and help create a sense of community. The goal  
in is to create safe places through limited access to properties,  
good surveillance, and a sense of ownership and responsibility.  
• Limit access to the subdivision without completely disconnecting  
it from neighboring areas. However, try to design streets to  
discourage cut-through traffic.  
• Paving treatments, plantings, and architectural design features such  
as columned gateways can guide visitors away from private areas.  
• Locate walkways where they can direct pedestrian traffic and  
remain unobscured.

• Use walkways and landscaping to direct visitors to the proper  
entrance and away from private areas.  
• All doorways that open to the outside as well as sidewalks and  
all areas of the yard should be well lit.  
• Make the front door at least partially visible from the street and  
clearly visible from the driveway or parking lot.  
• Windows on all sides of the building should provide full views of  
the property. The driveway should be visible from the front or  
back door and from at least one window.  
• Properly maintained landscaping should provide good views to  
and from the building.  
• Landscaping should not create blind spots or hiding places.  
• Locate open green spaces and recreational areas so they can be  
observed from nearby houses.  
• Use pedestrian-scale street lighting in areas with high pedes-  
trian traffic.  
• Make exterior doors visible to the street or neighbors, and  
ensure they are well lit.  
• All four building facades should have windows. Site buildings so  
that the windows and doors of one unit are visible from those of  
other units.  
• Assign parking spaces to each unit and locate them next to the  
unit. Designate special parking spaces for visitors.  
• Parking areas and walkways should be well lit.  
• Recreation areas should be visible from a multitude of windows  
and doors.  
• Dumpsters should not create blind spots or hiding places.  
• Shrubbery should be no more than 3 ft. high for clear visibility  
and tree canopies should not be lower than 8 ft. 6 in.  
• Design lots, streets, and houses to encourage interaction  
between neighbors.  
• Accent entrances with changes in street elevation, different  
paving materials, and other design features.  
• Clearly identify residences with street address numbers that are  
a minimum of 5 in. high and are well lit at night.  
• Property lines should be defined with post-and-pillar fencing,  
gates, and plantings to direct pedestrian traffic.  
• All parking should be assigned.  
• Entryways or vestibules create a transitional area between the  
street and the building.  
• Define property lines and private areas with plantings, pave-  
ment treatments, or fences.  
• The street address should be clearly visible from the street, with  
numbers a minimum of 5 in. high and made of nonreflective  
material.  
• Define property lines with landscaping or post-and-pillar fenc-  
ing, but keep shrubbery and fences low to allow visibility from  
the street.  
• Accent building entrances with architectural elements and light-  
ing and/or landscape features.  
• Doorknobs should be 40 in. from window panes.  
• Clearly identify all buildings and residential units with well-lit  
address numbers a minimum of 5 in. high.  
• Common doorways should have windows and be key-controlled  
by residents.  
• Locate mailboxes next to the appropriate residences.  
• Balcony railings should never be made of a solid, opaque mate-  
rial or be more than 42 in. high.

# LIFECYCLE CONSIDERATIONS  
Incorporating resilience into new building designs, existing build-  
ing retrofits, and ongoing building operations can carry significant  
costs. To justify investments in resilience it is imperative to evalu-  
ate the cost/benefit relationship of the investments over the full  
lifecycle of the facility. To evaluate increasing resilience, it is neces-  
sary to identify performance \(or for safety and security objectives,  
protection\) levels and their impact on reducing risk and increasing  
resilience. With performance/protection levels identified, the costs  
associated with achieving the performance/protection identified  
can be calculated and used to evaluate the benefits of higher  
resilience. The relationships between functional performance, risk,  
resilience, and cost are identified in Figure 3.36.  
Establishing the tradeoffs between performance and cost requires  
evaluating the relationships between the cost of providing building  
systems, their performance over the life of the facility, including  
response to undesirable events and the interrelationships between  
systems and performances. Traditional first-cost-estimating  
approaches cannot effectively handle these evaluations. Evaluating  
Total Cost of Ownership \(TCO\) is a more effective way to analyze  
all of the cost factors identified in Figure 3.36. TCO is calculated by  
establishing capital cost for the building or improvement and then  
adding to it the discounted costs of future expenses \(operations,  
maintenance, recovery\) to arrive at a TCO. TCO can then be com-  
pared for different configurations to perform a cost analysis of the  
benefits of increasing performance to increase resilience. This  
methodology is implemented in a DHS project entitled Owners  
Performance Requirements for Building Envelopes. More informa-  
tion about the approach and access to a tool that implements it is  
available in DHS \(2011\) and at www.oprtool.org.  
It has been shown that long-term planning can help immensely in  
cost savings \(see FEMA \[1996\] and MMC \[2005\]\). An objective  
way to accommodate such long-term cost savings is by following a  
reasonable resilience management procedure during planning,  
design, and throughout the life span of the building. Some details  
of resilience management components are offered in the chapter  
appendices.

# ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTATION PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTS  
# PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTS  
The procurement \(Bidding\) documents consist of three components\: the  
project manual, the contract drawings, and the addenda. See Figure 4.1  
The project manual contains the procurement requirements and  
text-based contract documents \(owner-contractor agreement,  
general conditions of the contract, supplementary conditions, and  
specifications\). The specifications identify, in narrative form, the  
qualitative, performance, and installation requirements for prod-  
ucts, materials, and workmanship, as well as the administrative  
procedures that govern each tract.  
The contract drawings are the graphic illustration of the project.  
They show the size, form, and representation of materials and  
systems, and the relationships between them. The contract draw-  
ings are bound separately from the project manual.  
The documents may need to be modified during the procurement  
period. These modifications are issued as addenda. An addendum  
can modify the drawings, the project manual, or both. Addenda can  
be issued in response to questions by bidders or proposers, or to  
reflect architect- or owner-initiated changes.  
Stipulated sum\: This approach is often referred to as a lump-sum  
or fixed-sum bid. The bid price is offered as a single-number value  
that represents all the costs required to build the project.  
Guaranteed maximum price\: Also known as GMP or GMax, the  
guaranteed maximum price is the cost of construction that the  
contractor assures the client for which the project will be built.  
Cost plus\: Also known as time and material or T&M pricing, this  
approach is based on the actual cost of the work. The contractor  
and subcontractors provide the client a detailed accounting of the  
cost of materials, equipment, and systems included in the project.  
Unit prices\: Unit prices are frequently used when a project’s full  
scope of work is unknown. The cost for each specific unit of work,  
including materials, labor, fees, overhead, profit, and similar fac-  
tors, are defined in the owner-contractor agreement.  
Target price\: Target pricing is used most often for design-build  
projects, where the owner identifies the construction cost as part  
of the procurement documents. A design-build team that can pro-  
vide the most scope for that cost is awarded the project.  
The proposed substitution information must provide documenta-  
tion that demonstrates compliance with the performance criteria  
and design intent of the contract documents. It should include\:  
A statement indicating why the specified product, fabrication, or  
installation cannot be provided.  
Coordination information, including a list of all changes to other  
portions of the work that will be necessary to accommodate the  
proposed substitution.  
A list of all modifications needed to other parts of the work, includ-  
ing construction performed by the owner and separate contractors.  
AIA Contract Documents are divided into six alphanumeric series  
by document use or purpose. Current AIA Documents, by Series,  
are categorized as follows\:  
A-Series\: Owner/Contractor Agreements  
B-Series\: Owner/Contractor Agreements  
C-Series\: Other Agreements  
D-Series\: Miscellaneous Documents  
E-Series\: Exhibits  
F-Series\: Reserved  
G-Series\: Contract Administration and Project Management Forms  
During the bidding period, bidding contractors may have questions  
about the project, the documents, or the bidding requirements. The  
procurement documents should define procedures for contractors  
to submit questions to the owner \(or the owner’s CM advisor\) or  
the architect. These requests for information \(RFI\) procedures  
should also be discussed in the pre-bid meeting. One person, who  
may be the owner, the CMa, or the architect, should be designated  
to receive all RFIs.  
RFI responses must be distributed to all bidders, not just to the bidder  
requesting the information. RFI responses are not part of the contract  
documents unless they are issued as an addendum to all bidders.  
The goal of the bidding and negotiation process is to determine the  
price a contractor will charge a client to construct the building  
described by the construction documents. There are five primary  
forms of bid prices\:  
The procurement documents will usually allow bidding contractors to  
propose alternatives to specified products, suppliers, or systems.  
Such proposals are defined as substitution requests. The instructions  
to bidders should define the information required to be submitted to  
allow the architect to properly evaluate a substitution request.  
During the construction phase, the primary objective of the archi-  
tect is to deliver contract administration \(CA\) services and work  
with the contractor toward providing the owner with a successful  
project that substantially conforms to the design concept. The  
general contractor and/or construction manager is responsible for  
maintaining certain minimum submittals to document decisions by  
the owner, architect and contractor.  
The contract documents prepared by the architect illustrate the  
completed project, but they are not a complete set of instructions on  
how to build the building. Instead, the documents express the design  
intent for the contractor to use in preparing its work plan. A primary  
part of the contractor’s work plan is contractor submittals. These  
include detailed drawings \(referred to as “shop drawings”\) pre-  
pared and approved by the contractor, detailed information or data  
from the product manufacturers, and physical product samples.  
Submittals are a part of the contractor’s work plan documents that  
illustrate in detail how the contractor plans to construct the work,  
and they must be submitted to the architect for review and  
approval. The architect determines which parts of the work require  
submittals, and the contractor is prohibited from performing those  
portions of the work without approved submittals.  
Constructor documentation is generally divided into three catego-  
ries\: Coordination Submittals, Action Submittals, and Informational  
Submittals.

# DRAWINGS  
Innovation and creativity are two words usually associated with  
aesthetic design. However, they can also be applied both to the  
methods of preparing construction drawings as well as to how  
architects convey that information to the document users. Modern  
architectural construction drawings can be so much more than a  
discrete assemblage of electronically generated parts and pieces.  
They can graphically weave a story not unlike a great novel. The  
very act of producing the drawings can be done in such a manner  
as to help foster a better understanding by the preparers of what  
they are doing, with the beneficial result of higher-quality work.  
As construction drawings are developed, what goals and expecta-  
tions should be established? Here are some suggestions\:  
• Produce drawings that are user friendly.  
• Organize drawings so clearly that indexes, certain references,  
and perhaps even sheet numbers can become unnecessary.  
• Create drawings that are graphically descriptive to such an  
extent that references and schedules can become superfluous.  
• Use techniques that lessen the printed graphic density to the  
extent that drawing scales can be significantly reduced.  
• Organize and place information in context with related elements  
that enhance understanding and visually reveal mistakes.

The U.S. National CAD Standard \(NCS\) is a compilation of related  
documents published by several organizations for the purposes of  
creating a national standard for construction-related CAD docu-  
ments. The demand for a national CAD standard comes from two  
sources. First, major facility owners such as the federal govern-  
ment were looking to establish a mechanism for organizing  
graphic facility information so that it could be easily stored and  
retrieved. Whereas most architects think about drawings only as  
construction documents, many facility owners perceive them as  
the basis of facility management documents. This information is  
used throughout the lifecycle of a facility for operation, renova-  
tions, additions, and, finally, facility decommissioning and demoli-  
tion. What has now come to be known as the facility cycle was a  
major impetus in the participation by the U.S. Department of  
Defense \(DoD\) in the creation of the NCS.  
The second major reason for the creation of the NCS was the  
demand by design professionals to develop standards to allow  
sharing of information and to minimize the need for each user  
group to create their own CAD standards, which required teams to  
adapt different CAD standards for each project, thus wasting time  
and money while achieving no benefit. The NCS was perceived as a  
method to provide uniformity from project to project and save time  
in production, thus allowing architects to spend more time on  
design. It was also viewed as a means to allow CAD software  
vendors to create tools around these standards that would make  
the production of the construction documents easier and faster.  
The National Institute of Building Sciences, the American  
Institute of Architects, the Construction Specifications Institute,  
and the Tri-Service CAD/GIS Technology Center are the contribut-  
ing organizations to the NCS. The NCS is updated periodically; the  
information presented here reflects NCS version 3.1, updated in  
January 2005.

Provide only critical dimensions on plans so as to keep them as  
uncluttered as possible. Consider the building trades using the  
dimensions and the sequencing of their work.  
Because tolerances vary in construction, the as-built dimensions  
do not always coincide with the design dimensions. Dimensioning  
from established grids or structural elements, such as columns  
and structural walls, assists the trades that must locate their  
work prior to that of others.  
Graphic symbols are representations of objects, materials, or  
words. Module 6, Symbols of the Uniform Drawing System \(UDS\),  
produced by the Construction Specifications Institute \(CSI\), is the  
portion of the U.S. National CAD Standard \(NCS\) that classifies,  
organizes, and presents graphic symbols used in construction  
documents. This discussion is a summary of the information con-  
tained in the Symbols module.  
The UDS Symbols module provides a hierarchy for the organization  
of symbols. Symbols are first organized by MasterFormat 2004  
Level 2 numbers, then by symbol classification type, and then  
alphabetically by description.

Object symbols are symbols that represent specific physical  
objects. Object symbols are generally used to indicate objects such  
as doors, windows, toilet fixtures, and furniture.  
The U.S. National CAD Standard provides six classifications of  
symbols. Following is a listing of the symbol types, description, and  
examples of each.  
Identity symbols are those symbols that indicate individual  
objects but are not representations of the objects. Identity sym-  
bols are generally used to indicate objects such as valves, fire  
alarms, light fixtures, and electrical outlets.  
Line symbols are symbols that indicate continuous objects and are  
drawn using either single or double lines. Line symbols are gener-  
ally used to indicate objects such as walls, ductwork, and utility  
lines.  
Text symbols are symbols that graphically indicate a word or words  
and may be in notations on drawings.  
Reference symbols are symbols that refer the reader to information  
in another area of the set of drawings, or give basic information  
regarding the drawings or data on the sheet. Reference symbols  
include such symbols as elevation indicators, detail indicators,  
north arrow, graphic scale, section indicators, and revision clouds.  
Material symbols are symbols that graphically indicate construc-  
tion materials or material of existing conditions. Material symbols  
may be shown in elevation, section, or plan views. Material sym-  
bols are generally used to indicate objects such as brick, stone,  
earth, wood, concrete, and steel.

results.” The primary uses of MasterFormat include organization of  
the project manual, detailed cost estimating, and drawing nota-  
tions including reference keynotes.  
There are numerous ways of organizing facility and construction  
information, from various points of view starting with project con-  
ception throughout the facility’s lifecycle. The OmniClass  
Construction Classification System, UniFormat, MasterFormat, and  
SectionFormat are the four primary structures for classifying and  
organizing facility information.  
CSI/CSC SectionFormat ™ provides a uniform approach to organiz-  
ing specification text within specification sections contained in a  
project manual. SectionFormat is a companion organizational tool  
to MasterFormat. MasterFormat provides a standardized system  
for sequence, numbers, titles, and scope of the elements, including  
sections, of a project manual. SectionFormat provides a standard-  
ized system to organize the data within each specification section.  
The OmniClass ™ Construction Classification System \(OCCS\) is  
designed to provide a standardized basis for classifying information  
created and used by the North American architectural, engineering,  
and construction \(AEC\) industry, throughout the full facility lifecycle,  
from conception to demolition, and encompassing all of the differ-  
ent types of construction that make up the built environment.  
Created by the OCCS Development Committee, an all-volunteer  
cross-industry coalition of organizations, firms, and individuals,  
OmniClass is intended to be the means for organizing, sorting, and  
retrieving information and deriving relational applications.  
Industry organizations are beginning to realize that a greater  
degree of harmonization in classifying information is now neces-  
sary and possible. The classification tables in the industry-created  
OmniClass address these criteria in an effort to make this harmo-  
nization a reality.  
OmniClass’ scope is designed to encompass objects at every scale  
of the built environment, from completed structures, large proj-  
ects, and multistructure complexes to individual products and  
component materials. Deviating from many of the systems that  
have preceded it, OmniClass also addresses actions, people, tools,  
and information that are used or take part in the design, construc-  
tion, and maintenance of these structures. It is anticipated that  
OmniClass will be used throughout a facility’s lifecycle, starting  
with facility conception, continuing through design and construc-  
tion, and finally to demolition and recycling of its components. The  
means to address classification throughout the lifecycle are pro-  
vided through both a table to track and document the stages, and  
also through properties to describe dating information for compo-  
nents and for modifications to the facility as a whole.  
OmniClass Table 22, Work Results is based on the concepts incor-  
porated into MasterFormat 2004. Conversely, the indexes and  
explanations of MasterFormat 2004 draw information from  
OmniClass Table 21, Elements and Table 23, Products , making it an  
application of OmniClass. Reference to other OmniClass tables is  
also made in the Applications Guide. For information on OmniClass,

CSI/CSC UniFormat ™ is designed to provide a standardized basis  
for classifying the physical elements of a facility by their primary  
function without regard to the particular work results that will be  
used to achieve the function. Substructure, shell, interiors, and  
services are examples of basic functional elements. The functional  
elements are often systems or assemblies. The shell element can  
be broken down into superstructure \(structural frame\), exterior  
enclosure \(exterior wall assemblies\), and roofing \(roofing assem-  
blies\). The services element can be broken down into conveying  
\(elevator systems\); plumbing \(domestic water distribution\); heat-  
ing, ventilating, and air-conditioning \(heat generation\); fire protec-  
tion \(fire sprinkler systems\); and electrical \(lighting systems\).  
UniFormat is an application of Table 21, Elements of OmniClass.

The OmniClass™ Construction Classification System \(known as  
OmniClass™ or OCCS\) is a new classification system for the con-  
struction industry. OmniClass is a classification scheme useful for  
numerous applications, from organizing library materials, structur-  
ing product literature, and structuring project information to pro-  
viding a classification structure for databases. It incorporates  
existing systems as the basis of many of its tables—  
MasterFormat™ for work results, UniFormat for elements, and  
EPIC \(Electronic Product Information Cooperation\) for structuring  
products.  
OmniClass is a strategy for classifying the entire built environment.  
The activities conducted throughout the lifecycle of any structure  
generate an enormous amount of data that needs to be stored,  
retrieved, communicated, and used by all parties involved.  
Advances in technology have increased the opportunities for gath-  
ering, providing access to, and exchanging this information.  
OmniClass is a publication of the OCCS Development Committee  
who has continually been updating and refining the OmniClass  
tables. This manuscript references the 2005 edition of the tables,  
published in late 2005.  
ISO 12006–2, “Organization of Information about Construction  
Works—Part 2\: Framework for Classification of Information,” and  
ISO/PAS 12006–3, “Organization of Information about Construction  
Works—Part 3\: Framework for Object-Oriented Information,”  
define methods of organizing the information associated with the  
construction and affiliated industries, and also promote a standard  
object-modeling definition for concepts addressed. Of these two  
standards, ISO 12006–2 has more immediate impact on OmniClass,  
and the OCCS Development Committee has closely adhered to this  
standard in establishing and defining the tables that make up  
OmniClass.  
OmniClass consists of 15 distinct tables, each of which represents  
a different facet of construction information. Each table can be  
used independently for the classification of a particular type of  
information, or be combined to classify more complex subjects.  
The 15 interrelated OmniClass tables are\:  
• Table 11—Construction Entities by Function  
• Table 12—Construction Entities by Form  
• Table 13—Spaces by Function  
• Table 14—Spaces by Form  
• Table 21—Elements \(Including Designed Elements\)  
• Table 22—Work Results  
• Table 23—Products  
• Table 31—Phases  
• Table 32—Services  
• Table 33—Disciplines  
• Table 34—Organizational Roles  
• Table 35—Tools  
• Table 36—Information  
• Table 41—Materials  
• Table 49—Properties  
UniFormat™ is an arrangement of construction information based  
on physical parts of a facility called elements or systems and  
assemblies. These elements are characterized by their function  
without identifying the products that compose them. Elements  
render a view of a constructed facility different from the view  
rendered by a breakdown of building materials, products, and  
activities. UniFormat is primarily used to organize preliminary  
project descriptions, preliminary cost estimates, and standard  
drawing detail filing. It is intended to complement MasterFormat.  
The Construction Specifications Institute \(CSI\) and Construction  
Specifications Canada \(CSC\) jointly produce UniFormat. UniFormat  
is updated periodically; the information herein reflects the 2001  
edition.  
UniFormat classifies information into the following nine Level 1  
categories\:  
• Project Description  
• A—Substructure  
• B—Shell  
• C—Interiors  
• D—Services  
• E—Equipment and Furnishings  
• F—Special Construction and Demolition  
• G—Building Sitework  
• Z—General  
The nine categories can be used to arrange brief project descrip-  
tions and preliminary cost information. Category Z—General is  
designated by the last letter of the alphabet so the system can  
expand beyond building construction. When so expanded, this cat-  
egory will remain at the end.  
Titles in Levels 1 through 3 can be applied to most project descrip-  
tions and preliminary cost estimates. Levels 4 and 5 are available  
for use on detailed, complex projects. Level 4 and 5 titles and  
detailed listings provide a checklist to ensure comprehensive and  
complete application of UniFormat.  
The transition from a document organized according to UniFormat  
to one organized according to MasterFormat may be easier by  
using MasterFormat extensions. When MasterFormat six-digit  
number extensions have been added, the document organized  
according to UniFormat may be searched or sorted according to  
the MasterFormat extension to regroup information. Sorting in this  
manner may help discover, for example, a list of elements common  
to cast-in-place concrete construction within the project.  
Most project manuals are arranged using MasterFormat.  
Specifications using both MasterFormat and UniFormat should not  
be combined into a single project manual.  
Performance specifying can be used at many levels, from a single  
product to major subsystems or entire projects. The choice of using  
either MasterFormat or UniFormat allows the architect to access a  
range of options. Performance specifying encourages competitive  
bidding based on nonproprietary requirements and, in its broadest  
application, is used for design-build projects. CSI's Construction  
Specifications Practice Guide provides detailed discussions about  
this application.  
The design-build project delivery has created a need for an organi-  
zational structure for communicating functional performance  
requirements, including organizing design-build requests for pro-  
posals. To communicate project performance requirements to  
design-build entities in requests for proposals, owners or archi-  
tects must describe those requirements. In turn, design-  
build contractors must use performance requirements to commu-  
nicate their proposals. UniFormat provides this organizational  
structure.

# ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTATION CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS  
MasterFormat™ is a master list of numbers and titles classified by  
work results or construction practices, primarily used to coordi-  
nate project manuals, organize detailed cost information, and  
relate drawing notations to specifications.  
Construction projects use many different kinds of delivery meth-  
ods, products, and installation procedures, but one thing is com-  
mon to all—the need for effective teamwork by the many parties  
involved to ensure the correct and timely completion of work. The  
successful completion of projects requires effective communica-  
tion among the people involved, and that in turn requires easy  
access to essential project information. Efficient information  
retrieval is only possible when everyone uses a standard filing  
system. MasterFormat provides such a standard filing and retriev-  
al scheme, which can be used throughout the construction industry.  
The Construction Specifications Institute \(CSI\) and Construction  
Specifications Canada \(CSC\) jointly produce MasterFormat.  
MasterFormat is updated periodically; the information in this text  
refers to the 2014 update.  
In the procurement requirements and contracting requirements,  
some owners may use different terminology for some of the docu-  
ments from those listed in MasterFormat. Users may alter the  
MasterFormat terms in favor of appropriate synonyms required by  
the owner. See the Master List of Numbers, Titles, and Explanations  
for examples.  
In the procurement requirements and contracting requirements,  
MasterFormat 2004 numbers have been assigned to provide a  
consistent sequencing within the document. However, it is not  
necessary to renumber or retitle printed forms and standard docu-  
ments published by various professional societies or contract  
issuing bodies to correspond with these numbers.  
An important strategy for naming drawing elements is related to  
the need to link requirements between complementary documents.  
One must examine the entire set of contract documents to deter-  
mine all of the requirements for a single product. Notations on  
drawings should use terminology consistent with that used in other  
contract documents, such as the specifications, to identify the  
specified work results and activities.  
Reference keynoting applications have adopted MasterFormat as a  
base numbering system, to enhance cross-referencing and coordi-  
nation between drawings and specifications. This formal method of  
linking between drawing objects and the specification is encourag-  
ing increased development of automated linking software. See the  
U.S. National CAD Standard, UDS Notations module for more  
information.  
All of the following MasterFormat groups and subgroups can be  
included in project manuals\:  
• Procurement and Contracting Requirements Group \(Division 00\)  
contains\:  
• Introductory Information\: Indexing and general-information  
documents are found at the beginning of project manuals.  
• Procurement Requirements and Contracting Requirements\:  
Referred to in MasterFormat 95 as the “Zero Series Num-  
bers and Titles” and now included in Division 00, they are to  
be used in the definition of the relationships, processes, and  
responsibilities for projects.  
• Specifications Group\: This group contains the following five  
subgroups. Each subgroup is broken down into Divisions as list-  
ed. This group has now grown from 16 divisions to 49 divisions  
\(16 of which are designated reserved for future expansion\).  
• General Requirements Subgroup\: Division 01.  
• Facility Construction Subgroup\: Divisions 02 through 19.  
• Facility Services Subgroup\: Divisions 20 through 29.  
• Site and Infrastructure Subgroup\: Divisions 30 through 39.  
• Process Equipment Subgroup\: Divisions 40 through 49.  
Groups are not numbered, but are divided into subgroups.  
Subgroups are not numbered, but are divided into numbered divi-  
sions. Divisions are the top Level \(Level 1\) in the hierarchy of the  
classification system. The divisions include sets of numbered titles  
\(Levels 2 through 4\). In a project manual application, the titles are  
called sections that specify “work results” \(Levels 2 through 4\).  
Work results are permanent or temporary aspects of construction  
projects achieved in the production stage or by subsequent altera-  
tion, maintenance, or demolition processes through the application  
of a particular skill or trade to construction resources.  
MasterFormat is not intended to provide a technical or product data  
filing system as there is not necessarily a single location at which  
any particular technical subject or product may be located in the  
system. A product that is used for multiple purposes or work  
results may be located in multiple locations in MasterFormat. If  
MasterFormat is used for product data filing, then the user should  
be aware that for some products an arbitrary choice of where to file  
the data among multiple locations must be made. Names of prod-  
ucts may be included in the titles in MasterFormat when they are  
synonymous with the work result. Products that might be included  
with a work result but not included in the title may be listed in the  
explanations column for the title, under the heading “Products.”  
Product data is identified using MasterFormat numbers and titles  
to clarify the relationship between products and specifications.  
MasterFormat numbers can be used as suffixes within another  
cataloging system, such as the Dewey Decimal Classification, the  
Universal Decimal Classification, or the U.S. Library of Congress  
classification.  
Suppliers’ and subcontractors’ data \(such as qualification informa-  
tion or submittals\) may be identified by the work result they supply  
or install. The work of suppliers and subcontractors often tran-  
scends section and division boundaries, so some method is  
required for multiple references to MasterFormat titles.  
The inventory of construction products is made simpler by using the  
specification section number, perhaps as a suffix to a project number.  
If more than one product is specified in a section, then some form of  
suffix to the section number is needed to distinguish the products.  
SectionFormat™ provides a uniform approach to organizing speci-  
fication text within a section of a project manual. The organization  
structure is based on three primary parts; each part is further  
divided into article subjects to standardize the location of informa-  
tion into a logical order.  
The Construction Specifications Institute \(CSI\) and Construction  
Specifications Canada \(CSC\) jointly produce SectionFormat.  
SectionFormat is currently undergoing review and revision to  
reflect the current state of the industry. The revised document was  
published in late 2007.  
SectionFormat consists of three primary parts\: GENERAL,  
PRODUCT, and EXECUTION.  
• PART 1—GENERAL\: Describes administrative, procedural, and  
temporary requirements unique to the section. PART 1 expands  
on information covered in Division 1 with information specific to  
the section.  
• PART 2—PRODUCTS\: Describes materials, products, equip-  
ment, systems, or assemblies that are required for incorpora-  
tion into the project. Manufactured materials and products are  
included along with the quality level required.  
• PART 3—EXECUTION\: Describes preparatory actions and the  
method in which products are to be incorporated into the proj-  
ect. Site-built assemblies and site-manufactured products and  
systems are included.  
Each PART is divided into articles, which are then further divided  
into paragraphs and subparagraphs. If a section does not require  
the use of one or two of the three PARTS, then the PART number  
and title is stated and the words “Not Used” are placed under the  
PART title.

MasterFormat’s organizational structure used in a project manual  
does not imply how the work is assigned to various design disci-  
plines, trades, or subcontractors. MasterFormat is not intended to  
determine which particular elements of the project manual are  
prepared by a particular discipline. Similarly, it is not intended to  
determine what particular work required by the project manual is  
the responsibility of a particular trade. A particular discipline or  
trade is likely to be responsible for subjects from multiple divi-  
sions, as well as from multiple subgroups.  
MasterFormat’s organizational structure does not determine what  
is and is not a contract document. Generally, the documents  
included in the contracting requirements will include a definition  
and listing of the contract documents for a particular project.  
Cost classification requires identification of line items, which are  
often related to products and activities. An identification scheme  
based on MasterFormat can be flexible, varying with each con-  
struction project, or more rigid and uniform, establishing a single  
number and location for similar costs in many projects. OmniClass  
Table 21—Elements is also recommended when dealing with con-  
struction costing applications in the earlier stages of a project  
before particular work results have been selected. Similar to the  
way that OmniClass Table 22—Work Results is based on  
MasterFormat 2004, the Elements Table is based on the existing  
legacy system UniFormat.  
Organizing unit-price databases using the same numbering and  
titling format for specifying and naming data files benefits the user  
with increased uniformity and standardization. Familiarity with  
MasterFormat allows users to relate specification requirements,  
product information, and cost data. Numbers and titles under  
“Procurement Requirements” and “Contracting Requirements” in  
Division 00 identify cost items related to bonds, insurance, permits,  
fees, and other general items. Numbers and titles in Division 01  
identify unit costs for temporary construction facilities and con-  
trols, mobilization, project site administration, and other general  
requirement cost items. Numbers and titles in the other subgroups  
of the Specifications Group identify costs related to work results  
and their installation.  
Organizing and tabulating cost reports may require indicating or  
summarizing products and activities. Using MasterFormat numbers  
and titles will aid users in making inferences about material costs  
while analyzing the report.  
In an effort to implement construction projects that have the least  
impact on the environment, specifiers routinely include into the  
specifications requirements such as the following\:  
• Low- or no-VOC paints, coatings, sealants, and adhesives  
• Products with high recycled content  
• Products that have been manufactured, harvested, or recovered  
regionally  
• Roofing and paving materials with high reflectance values  
• Particleboard and insulations with no added urea formaldehyde  
• Flooring products that have received FloorScore certifications  
• Lumber, trim, doors, casework, etc., that are certified as being  
harvested from sustainably managed forests  
• Recycling of construction waste by the contractor  
• Provision by the contractor of an indoor air quality plan during  
construction  
• High R-values for exterior building components

# BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING \(BIM\)  
A data model in any given domain describes the attributes of the  
entities in that domain, as well as how these entities are related to  
each other. All computer programs deal with some kind of data, so  
they must have some type of underlying data model. Traditional 2D  
CAD and generic 3D modeling programs such as Autodesk  
AutoCAD, Trimble SketchUP, Autodesk 3DS Max, Robert McNeel and  
Associates Rhinoceros 3D, and AutoDesSys form•Z internally rep-  
resent data using geometric entities such as points, lines, rectan-  
gles, planes, and so forth. Thus, although these applications can  
accurately describe geometry in any domain, they cannot capture  
domain-specific information about entities. The drawings and mod-  
els of buildings created with these applications don’t carry much  
information about the building itself, and are essentially “dumb.”  
They are used primarily for producing documentation and for  
visualization.  
To overcome the limited intelligence of general-purpose geometric  
representations, every design-related industry has been developing  
and using object-based data models that are specific to their  
domains. In the case of the building industry, both researchers at  
universities and commercial software vendors have worked to  
develop a data model that is constructed around building entities and  
their relationships to one another. Geometry is only one of the prop-  
erties, among others, of these building entities; thus, its primacy is  
greatly reduced, even though the interface to creating the model is  
still primarily graphic. Such a data model is rich in information about  
the building, which can be extracted and used for various purposes,  
be it documentation, visualization, or analysis.  
Building information modeling \(BIM\) is the term that has been  
coined to describe the use of such a model. Several software  
applications are available that are built upon this concept, such as  
Graphisoft’s ArchiCAD, Bentley MicroStation, Autodesk Revit, and  
many others.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Traditional 2D CAD technology has dominated the construction  
industry for decades, and technological progress has been severe-  
ly constrained by the limited intelligence of such applications in  
representing buildings and the capability to extract the relevant  
information from the representation that is needed for design,  
analysis, construction management, operation, and so on.  
Drawings are no longer done manually, but the ubiquitous use of  
CAD applications in creating drawings has not revolutionized the  
construction industry in any way. CAD continues to have all the  
problems associated with manual drafting\:  
It is tedious and time-consuming to create separate plans, sec-  
tions, elevations, details, and so forth, of the same building.  
Any change made must be manually updated in all drawings and reports.  
There is no guarantee of accuracy, consistency, or completeness.  
Coordinating work based on these drawings between the different  
professionals is extremely difficult.  
Conflicts and errors are detected in abundance at the construction  
site, necessitating expensive fixes.  
At the end of the process, the owner/operator has nothing but a  
nonintelligent 2D representation of the building on which to base a  
lifetime of management, operation, and maintenance.  
Analysis and evaluations of energy efficiency, circulation, egress, and  
other aspects of the building, haven’t really become an integral part  
of the design process as the building data is not available in any  
intelligent format and has to be tediously reentered into analysis  
tools. As a result, the quality of the building suffers. In short, CAD  
simply replicates the processes of manual drafting by reducing build-  
ing representations to dumb graphic entities and does little to reduce  
the inefficiency, waste, errors, and escalating costs that are all too  
common in the design, construction, and operation of a building.  
Unlike CAD, which is general-purpose, BIM is specific to building  
design\: It represents a building using intelligent objects that know  
about their properties and about their relationship to other objects.  
Therefore, with BIM, a full 3D representation of the building can be

# ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTATION BIM  
created that simulates how it would be in real life; from this  
information-rich model, any kind of data needed for design, analy-  
sis, visualization, documentation, construction management, oper-  
ation, and so on, can be derived.  
The potential benefits of implementing BIM are manifold\:  
Because it is customized for building design, it is faster and easier  
to create and edit a building model in a BIM application, compared  
to developing the drawings of the building in a CAD application.  
Once the model is created, all other requirements, including 2D  
documentation, schedules, reports, 3D renderings, and animations,  
can be automatically derived from it, improving speed and efficiency.  
All graphical and tabular views of the building are automatically  
synchronized when a change is made to the model, eliminating the  
inconsistencies found in construction documents created with  
conventional CAD software.  
The minimization of drafting allows greater focus on design.  
Interdisciplinary collaboration can be significantly improved, as it  
will be based on a shared building model.  
Better support for analysis and evaluation tools will allow the build-  
ing to be thoroughly and vigorously tested before it is built, instituting  
much higher standards of quality control than those in place today.  
Conflicts are easier to identify in the building model and can be  
detected during the design phase, which can reduce the expensive  
fixes at construction time.  
The model created during the design phase can be reused for  
subsequent phases such as construction and facilities manage-  
ment, saving costs.  
The use of a “live” model for building maintenance can reduce  
operating costs significantly throughout the lifetime of the building.  
In general, BIM is a methodology that has the potential to inte-  
grate and dramatically streamline operations and processes in the  
architecture, building, and construction and facilities operations  
and management industries.  
Aside from the advantages of designing in three dimensions, this holistic approach allowed for more efficient coordination between sys-  
tems and components, as well as more effective management of part schedules and cost models. With BIM software, one model is the  
sole source of all project information\: It drives all details, fabrication drawings, finish schedules, and parts lists. As a shop-fabricated  
project, this degree of control became very important for KTA in Loblolly House.  
Screenshot of the Loblolly House in Revit. This virtual model of the house has all its layers “turned on,” from four different interior and  
exterior perspectives.

To illustrate the application of BIM software, a real-world example is  
included here. It demonstrates how the Autodesk Revit family of  
products was used in the construction of a single-family residence, the  
Loblolly house, in Taylors Island, Maryland, on the Chesapeake Bay.  
This 1800 sq. ft. weekend house was designed by Kieran Timberlake  
Associates \(KTA\) from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With a tight  
construction schedule and without access to skilled local labor, the  
architects embraced the precision of off-site shop-fabricated, site-  
assembled construction. This necessitated a three-dimensional  
understanding of the building and its components, which led to  
their use of BIM software.  
KTA’s systematic approach to Loblolly House allowed the architects to  
seamlessly combine standard on-site with unconventional off-site  
construction strategies. Use of Autodesk’s BIM software, Revit,  
enabled them to improve communication among themselves, engi-  
neers, fabricators, and contractors, to collapse all phases of the  
project into a virtual snapshot. Design decisions were made in tandem  
with detailing, building system, fabrication, and shipping decisions.  
The holistic nature of a single virtual model circumnavigated many  
of the unknowns that slow down traditional building processes. By  
understanding Revit’s capabilities, as well as its limitations, KTA  
could customize the software in response to the specifics of the  
project. In many cases, they had to reteach the software how to  
“behave” with respect to issues of shop fabrication and modular  
construction. Proof of their mastery of the software is evident in  
the project’s 30-day overall construction schedule.  
This example describes the attributes and benefits of Autodesk’s  
Revit BIM software by examining each of the major construction  
components in the project\: scaffolding, framing, and skin.

Exploded axonometric of Loblolly house with its four major components\: scaffolding, cartridges, boxes, and exterior skin.  
Fabricators extruded the aluminum profiles, which comprised the  
structural frame, cut them to size, then shipped them to the site for  
assembly. The characteristics of these profiles required a great  
degree of accuracy, so KTA created a library of aluminum profiles  
within the Revit model. This enabled them to assemble the frame  
virtually, much as it would be erected on-site. Each aluminum  
component contained embedded data, including the size of the  
profile, length, manufacturer and distributor information, and cost.  
Modeling the project in Revit also allowed KTA to accurately study  
sequencing, detailing, and tolerances during the early design  
phases of the project. In the case of the scaffolding and all of the  
project’s construction components, BIM software shortened the  
on-site assembly of all building elements above the piling founda-  
tion to an astonishing two weeks.  
KTA used the schedule produced from the embedded information in  
Revit for a number of important purposes\: coordination with the  
structural engineer, development of a cost model, and, most impor-  
tantly, as a parts list for purchasing this material. Having a single  
model to which all participants in the design, fabrication, and con-  
struction of Loblolly House could refer greatly simplified communi-  
cation and coordination of changes. This meant that material,  
detailing, and cost considerations found their way into the project  
very early in its development. Traditional, two-dimensional con-  
struction drawings gave way to a holistic virtual model.  
The Revit screenshot in Figure 4.15 shows the relationship of the light aluminum framing elements to the heavier framing members sup-  
ported by randomly placed pilings.

produced these off-site as multilevel units before attaching them  
to the structural frame on-site. Offset 16 in. from a fully retract-  
able, double-glazed storefront, the whole assembly created a  
high-performance cavity wall.  
Unlike typical walls built on-site, these wall modules had to respect  
the limitations of shipping. Therefore, awareness of their parame-  
ters was particularly useful during fabrication. KTA understood the  
performance requirements of constructing a functional rainscreen  
wall. Using Revit allowed them to closely monitor the relationship  
between off-the-shelf and custom components to render the  
screen operationally sound.  
The house’s wood rainscreen is held away from an operable glass wall by 16 in.

All component specification information is captured within a BIM  
application, which means that any kind of data needed for design,  
analysis, visualization, documentation, construction management,  
operation, and so on, can be derived from it, thus allowing the  
building to be simulated as it would be in real life. There are many  
BIM applications that impact all aspects of design, construction,  
and operation.  
Some examples are\:  
Computational design technologies\: Recent improvements in  
visual programming coupled with reduced cost of computational  
power have led to a movement in design where building parame-  
ters can be driven through rapid iteration. Computational design  
is currently used to generate lower-cost material-saving struc-  
tures, more energy-efficient buildings, and highly specialized  
constructions.  
Tools that check a BIM for design and modeling errors\: There are  
several tools available that aid in the detection of potential design  
problems, conflicts, and code violations. One of the key benefits of  
BIM is its capability to facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration,  
particularly when BIM is being used by all the different disciplinary  
professionals involved in a project. This category of tools includes  
the architectural, structural, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing com-  
ponents. There are several examples of such tools including open  
source and cloud-hosted solutions. “Collision detection” is accept-  
ed as common practice in the industry today.  
Tools for energy analysis\: These tools have a long history in the  
architecture, engineering, and construction \(AEC\) industry and  
have been used since the advent of computing. Prior to BIM, using  
these tools involved a great deal of manual entry of the building  
data, a tedious process that was prone to inaccuracy. With BIM, the  
building data is already available in a semantically meaningful form  
and the data can be directly input to an energy analysis tool. There  
are even some BIM applications that integrate building lifecycle  
and daylight analysis capabilities directly into the design tools. This  
allows for rapid design iteration while considering energy factors  
early in the design process when the designer has the most ability  
to affect change in the project.  
Structural design and analysis tools\: Similar to energy analysis  
tools, these tools also have a long history of use in the industry  
and have traditionally relied on manual reentry of the building  
data. Now, BIM structural modeling tools exist that automatically  
link to industry standard structural analysis software. Some BIM  
applications provide a bidirectional link to the structural analysis  
tools, which not only automatically input the analytical model of  
the structure to those tools but also use the results of the analysis  
to automatically update the physical model and all the related  
documentation.

Cost estimating tools\: For cost estimating, BIM again removes the  
need for tedious, manual entry of building data into estimating  
tools, and provides the capability to directly link to the building  
model for quantity takeoff and scheduling. Some estimating mod-  
ules also contain a 5D reporting system \(i.e., 3D model plus time  
sequence plus cost\) that use the construction model as the link  
between cost and time and produces cost-loaded schedules for  
financial analysis.  
Specifications tools\: There are a few examples of specifications  
tools that work with Building Information Models. By linking prod-  
uct specification directly to model elements users can automate  
much of the spec writing and keynoting processes, as well as  
reduce omissions and errors.  
Code-checking tools\: Of the various analysis and evaluation tools  
that can be supported by BIM, code-checking stands near the top  
of the list as one of the areas ripe for automation. Because BIM is  
so information-rich, it is able to support at least a partial code  
check.  
becoming an impediment to achieving the full potential of BIM.  
What is required is that these applications be able to easily “inter-  
operate,” which is where the Industry Foundation Classes \(IFC\)  
comes in.  
product certification process. The IFC model specification is post-  
ed publicly and is accessible to anyone, so developers can work  
with it and build the necessary IFC import and export capabilities  
into their applications.  
Looking at the actual IFC model itself in some more detail, it rep-  
resents not just tangible building components such as walls, doors,  
beams, ceilings, furniture, and so on, but also more abstract con-  
cepts such as schedules, activities, spaces, organization, construc-  
tion costs, and others in the form of entities . All entities can have  
a number of properties such as name, geometry, materials, finish-  
es, relationships, and so on.  
Most BIM applications by commercial vendors have proprietary  
internal data models and so cannot communicate their rich building  
information directly with each other unless they develop specific  
translators for this purpose. Neither can they communicate with  
other third-party analysis or evaluation tools unless a link has been  
custom-developed or the product has an Application Program  
Interface \(API\). This inhibits the free flow of building information  
across the various applications used by the individual players,  
The IFC is an object-based building data model similar to that of  
commercial BIM applications, except that it is nonproprietary. It  
has been developed and maintained by the buildingSMART Alliance  
\(formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability\), a global  
consortium of commercial companies and research organizations  
founded, in 1995, as an industry-based not-for-profit organization.  
The IFC model is intended to support interoperability across the  
individual, discipline-specific applications that are used to design,  
construct, and operate buildings by capturing information about all  
aspects of a building throughout its lifecycle. It was specifically  
developed as a means to exchange model-based data between  
model-based applications in the AEC and facilities management  
\(FM\) industries, and is now supported by all of the major CAD/BIM  
vendors, as well as an increasing number of downstream analysis  
application vendors. With 14 chapters in 19 countries and 650  
member companies funding its development, it is a truly global  
effort.  
Because the IFC is an open data exchange format that captures  
building information, it can be used by the commercial BIM appli-  
cations to exchange data with each other. This requires the appli-  
cation to be IFC-compliant, which means that it is capable of  
importing and exporting IFC files. Applications are assigned the  
IFC-compliant tag by going through a buildingSMART-supervised  
The main architecture of the IFC model shows how the model has  
been designed. From the broadest perspective, the model is divid-  
ed into four separate layers, representing four different levels.  
Each layer comprises several diverse categories, and it is within  
each category, or schema, that the individual entities are defined.  
For example, the Wall entity \(called IfcWall\) falls in the Shared  
Building Elements schema, which in turn belongs to the  
Interoperability layer. The layering system is designed in such a  
way that an entity at a given level can only be related to or refer-  
ence an entity at the same or lower level, but not an entity at a  
higher level. The modular design of the overall architecture is  
intended to make the model easier to maintain and grow. Lower-  
level entities can be reused in higher-level definitions and a clear  
distinction can be made between the different AEC/FM disciplinary  
entities so that the model can be more easily implemented in indi-  
vidual, discipline-specific applications.

# CONCRETE CONCRETE FORMING AND ACCESSORIES  
# CONCRETE FORMING AND ACCESSORIES  
Concrete forming and accessories includes permanent and tempo-  
rary forms, anchors, inserts, expansion and control joints, and  
waterstops for structural and architectural cast-in-place concrete.  
Concrete forms include metal pan forms, wood forms, plastic  
forms, slip forms, and corrugated paper forms for placing con-  
crete. These may also include form liners and void forms.  
For tie patterns that are not gang-formed, due to limited reusabil-  
ity, a 2-ft by 2-ft tie pattern should be a maximum with a 1-ft by 1-ft  
pattern a corresponding minimum.  
For tie patterns that are gang-formed, a 4-ft by 4-ft pattern is a  
minimum spacing using the tie capacities. A corresponding maxi-  
mum spacing is 6 ft. by 6 ft. Keep in mind the locations of vertical  
and horizontal construction joints when establishing tie locations.  
Exterior wall forms often require form anchors embedded in the  
concrete for each lift. The anchors can be patched, but doing so  
may detract from the concrete appearance.  
Formwork costs are a substantial part of the total expense of put-  
ting concrete in place. Thus, by developing design elements and  
details that simplify or standardize form requirements, the archi-  
tect can help contain construction costs. The following are recom-  
mendations for economy in concrete forming\:  
• Form reuse\: This is crucial to economy of construction. The  
design professional can facilitate form reuse by standardizing  
the dimensions of openings, columns, beams, and footings,  
using as few different sizes of each as possible. For example,  
where columns must change size, hold one dimension constant  
\(e.g., width\) while varying the other \(depth\). This enables at  
least half of the form panels to be used many times. Repeat the  
same floor and column layout from bay to bay on each floor and  
from floor to floor. This improves labor productivity and permits  
reuse of forms.  
• Mockups\: The architect and contractor should agree on the loca-  
tion and desired appearance of architectural surfaces before  
the exposed concrete work begins. Specify a mockup to help  
achieve this and to avoid disagreements during and after con-  
struction.  
• Large panel forms\: Wherever possible, make uninterrupted  
formed areas the same size. Increasing the size of such areas  
enables the contractor to combine form panels into gangs for  
efficient crane use.  
• Design details\: Intricacies and irregularities cost more and  
often do not add proportionately to the aesthetic effect.  
• Steel-framed plywood panels\: These are best when column  
heights or size varies widely. Ganged/hinged/custom column  
forms are used to improve labor efficiency when multiple reuse  
\(10-plus\) can be planned. The productivity gained with each  
cycle will offset the increased form costs.  
Flat beams designed to be equal in depth to the floor assembly are  
the least costly, as they most efficiently accommodate flying-form  
construction. Deeper, narrower beams cost more; but if deeper  
beams are required, costs can be controlled by making the beam  
the same thickness as the column depth and at least partially  
upturned. The upturned portion of the spandrel beam should be  
less than 30 in. for best economy. The most costly option is a col-  
umn thicker than the beam. This requires a column collar with a  
construction joint.  
A good joint solution is to add a second layer of plywood to the  
formwork, staggering the joints from the face sheet. Though, difficult  
to achieve with site-built forms, applying joint sealant at formwork  
joints provides the most aesthetic joint. Because of limited access  
space, sealing formwork joints on both sides of a wall form is  
nearly impossible and will significantly increase the formwork cost.  
Adapting design elements to the modular sizes of formwork lumber  
and plywood and dimensioning parts of the structure to fit the  
modules can save the expense of custom formwork. For example,  
to save the waste and time of sawing and piecing together the edge  
form, make the depth of the drop in a slab equal to the actual size  
of standard lumber, plus 3/4 in. for the plywood’s thickness.

Commonly made of steel-framed plywood, panels are also avail-  
able in aluminum. Wall ties \(typically flat ties\) and wall forms are  
held together by slotted pins that run through adjoining holes. A  
wedge pushed down into the slot alongside the wall form tightens  
the joint. Formwork service life can be extended by turning or  
replacing the plywood facing. To produce patterned concrete, reus-  
able plastic liners may be used. For maximum economy, panels can  
be assembled in large gangs and set in place by crane. Steel-  
framed plywood panels and/or flat-tie wall forms are predomi-  
nately used for structural concrete. The breakage of the flat tie and  
the steel frame imprint in the concrete can detract from concrete  
appearance.  
In general, the least costly design to form has columns the same  
width or narrower than the beams they support, allowing the beam  
form to be erected in a continuous line. In mid-cost formwork  
design, the beam bottom forms are cut to fit around the column  
tops. In high-cost formwork design, the beam forms are fitted into  
pockets on both sides of the column forms.  
Formwork joints are inherent in concrete work because of plywood  
panels. Architectural concrete will usually require a more aes-  
thetic joint. A compressible foam gasket should only be used when  
a rustication is added. Epoxy on a 45-degree cut, tongued and  
grooved \(with sealant\), taped, splined \(with sealant\), and gasketed  
with closed-cell compressible material are frequently acceptable  
formwork joints for structural concrete. 2x joint backing is accept-  
able for plywood joints in a single direction, but are not practical  
for perpendicular joints.  
Installing and removing ties and patching tie holes are some of the  
most labor-intensive operations in concrete forming. Also, getting  
a durable, inconspicuous patch often proves difficult. Avoid this  
problem by specifying smooth cone fittings at the tie ends, then  
either leaving the resulting uniform tie holes exposed or plugging  
them with preformed concrete plugs and a bonding agent.  
Corrodible metal must have coverage of a minimum 1-1/2 in. of  
concrete. Contractors may propose tie spacing wider than 2 ft. o.c.  
to reduce the total number of ties to save money, but this requires  
stronger ties and heavier form supports.

In tilt-up concrete, walls are cast on the completed floor slab, which  
must be level, smoothly finished, and treated with a bond-breaking  
agent to permit easy separation. The wall is then tilted or lifted into  
vertical position and fastened to the adjoining wall piece. This  
method reduces formwork and labor and eliminates transportation  
requirements that may limit panel size.

# CONCRETE CONCRETE FORMING AND ACCESSORIES  
Flat ties are light-duty ties used with a wedge and bolt to secure  
and space modular wall forms.  
Taper tie assemblies are generally used for heavy-duty loads of up  
to 50,000 lb. Taper ties are versatile in that their parts are removed  
after the concrete cures and may be reused. Ties may be installed  
after forms are in place.  
Fiberglass form ties are straight rods secured with reusable exter-  
nal metal grippers and have safe working loads ranging from 2250  
to 25,000 lb. The ties are readily broken off or cut at the concrete  
surface and then ground flush.  
Snap ties are for light-duty use, fabricated so the exposed ends of  
the tie can be snapped off at the breakback \(a notch in the rod\). The  
antiturn device makes it easy to break off the exposed end.  
Anchors are used with coil ties to facilitate single-side forming of  
walls.  
Steel wedges are placed at the outside threaded ends of pullout or  
snap tie rods, holding the formwork in place. Plastic or wood cones  
may be placed on the tie rod at the formwork wall surface, so that  
when the formwork is removed the tie rod ends are set back for  
subsequent finishing \(with plugs, etc.\).  
The cam lock bracket is a light-duty assembly suitable for job-set  
forms.  
Bar supports are used to maintain the design location of the rein-  
forcement away from the wall sides or slab bottom. They are typi-  
cally made of stainless-steel epoxy- or plastic-coated steel, or  
plastic.

Concrete formwork accessories include ties, anchors, hangers,  
and spacers used to hold forms and reinforcements in place  
against the forces of uncured concrete and other loads applied  
during construction. Concrete ties are tensile units used to hold  
concrete forms together, and may be classified by use or by load-  
carrying capacity.  
• Use classification of formwork tie\: “Continuous single member,”  
in which the entire tie rod extends through the wall and through  
both sides of the formwork \(this can be a pullout tie or a snap-  
off tie\), and “internal disconnecting,” in which the tensile unit  
has an inner part with threaded connections to the removable  
external members.  
• Load-carrying classification of formwork ties\: Light-duty, which  
has safe working loads of up to 3750 lb. and heavy-duty, which  
will carry loads of more than 3750 lb. concrete ties.  
Safe working load should be set at no more than half the tie’s  
ultimate strength. Other hardware assemblies and configurations  
may be available; consult manufacturers for complete details.  
Coil ties are medium- to heavy-duty ties fabricated to accept a  
threaded bolt, which passes through the formwork lumber.

5.19 Waterstops are flexible barriers used to prevent the passage of  
liquids and gases under pressure through joints in concrete slabs.  
Waterstops are typically made of polyvinyl chloride, and their shapes  
vary according to application. If a center bulb is specified, it must  
remain unembedded in the center of the joint.  
5.20 a. This type of formwork is used to fireproof structural steel beams  
by wrapping them in concrete.

# CONCRETE REINFORCING  
Concrete reinforcing includes reinforcement of all types including  
tension, compression, and temperature-reinforcing steel, welded  
wire fabric \(coated and uncoated\), stressing tendon, and fibrous  
reinforcing to increase the structural capabilities of concrete.

Steel reinforcement for concrete consists of reinforcing steel and  
welded wire fabric. Reinforcing steel, commonly known as bars,  
are manufactured by a hot-rolling process as round rods with ribs,  
or deformations, which inhibit longitudinal movement of the bar in  
the surrounding concrete. Bar sizes are indicated by numbers. For  
sizes \#3 through \#8 \(\#10 through \#25\), the numbers reflect  
eighths of an inch \(millimeters\) in the nominal diameter of the bars.  
Sizes \#9, \#10, and \#11 \(\#29, \#32, and \#36\) are round and  
correspond to the former 1 in., 1-1/8 in., and 1-1/4 in. square  
sizes. Sizes \#14 and \#18 \(\#43 and \#57\) correspond to the for-  
mer 1-1/2 in. and 2 in. square sizes. The nominal diameter of a  
deformed bar is equal to the actual diameter of a plain bar with the  
same weight per foot \(mass per meter\) as the deformed bar.  
Epoxy-coated, zinc-coated \(galvanized\), and stainless steel rein-  
forcing are used when corrosion protection is needed; stainless  
steel also has nonmagnetic properties.  
Welded wire fabric is used in thin slabs, shells, and other designs  
in which available space is too limited to give proper concrete  
cover and clearance to deformed bars. Welded wire reinforcement,  
also called “mesh,” consists of cold-drawn wire \(plain or deformed\)  
in orthogonal patterns; it is resistance-welded at all intersections.  
Wire in the form of strand is used in prestressed concrete members.

# TYPICAL COMPONENTS APPLICABLE TO CONCRETE WORK  
Cast-in-place concrete includes concrete mixture placement, fin-  
ishing, and curing for structural, architectural, and specialty placed  
concrete. The concrete mixture generally includes aggregate,  
cement, and additives.  
The aggregates portion of the concrete mixture is divided into fine  
and coarse aggregates. The fine aggregate is generally sand of  
particles less than 3/8 inch large. The coarse aggregate is crushed  
stone or gravel greater than 3/8 inch. Sand, crushed rock, or  
gravel concrete weighs 135 to 165 pcf. Lightweight aggregate is  
manufactured from expanded shale, slate, clay, or slag, and the  
concrete weighs 85 to 115 pcf. Normal weight aggregates must  
meet ASTM Specification C33. The aggregate represents 60 to 80  
percent of the concrete volume.  
When cement, aggregate, and water are mixed, a chemical reac-  
tion is started. Concrete gains strength through curing. Standard  
cement is assumed to achieve 100 percent of its design compres-  
sive strength 28 days after mixing begins. The majority of strength  
is gained in the first few days of curing. About one-half of the  
strength may be achieved in three days. Concrete cylinder com-  
pressive tests will be performed in advance of the 28 days.  
Accelerators \(ASTM C 494, Type C\) Accelerate setting and early-strength  
development.  
Calcium chloride \(ASTM D 98\); triethanolamine, sodium  
thiocyanate, calcium formate, calcium nitrate, calcium  
nitrite  
Air detrainers Decrease air content. Tributyl phosphate, dibutyl phthalate, octyl alcohol, water-  
insoluble esters of carbonic and boric acid, silicones  
Air-entraining admixtures \(ASTM C 260\) Improve durability in environments of  
freeze-thaw, deicers, sulfate, and alkali  
reactivity. Improve workability.  
Salts of wood resins, some synthetic detergents, salts  
of sulfonated lignin, salts of petroleum acids, salts of  
proteinaceous material, fatty and resinous acids and their  
salts, alkylbenzene sulfonates, salts of sulfonated  
hydrocarbons  
Alkali-aggregate reactivity inhibitors Reduce alkali-aggregate reactivity  
expansion.  
Barium salts, lithium nitrate, lithium carbonate, lithium  
hydroxide  
Bonding admixtures Increase bond strength. Rubber, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, acrylics,  
butadiene-styrene copolymers  
Coloring admixtures Colored concrete. Modified carbon black, iron oxide, phthalicyanine, umber,  
chromium oxide, titanium oxide, cobalt blue \(ASTM C 979\)  
Corrosion inhibitors \(ASTM C1582\) Reduce steel corrosion activity in a chloride  
environment.  
Calcium nitrite, sodium nitrite, sodium benzoate, certain  
phosphates of fluosilicates, fluoaluminates  
Dampproofing admixtures Retard moisture penetration into dry  
concrete.  
Soaps of calcium or ammonium stearate or oleate, butyl  
stearate, petroleum products  
Fungicides, germicides, and insecticides Inhibit or control bacterial and fungal  
growth.  
Polyhalogenated phenols, dieldrin emulsions, copper  
compounds  
Gas formers Cause expansion before setting. Concrete admixtures are supplementary materials other than  
portland cement, water, and aggregates that are added to the  
mixture immediately before or during mixing. Admixtures can be  
classified by function as follows\: air-entraining admixtures;  
water-reducing admixtures; retarding admixtures; accelerating  
admixtures; superplasticizers; hydration-control admixtures; and  
miscellaneous admixtures that aid workability, bonding, damp-  
proofing, gas-forming, grouting \(non-shrink\), coloring, and admix-  
tures that reduce permeability and inhibit corrosion.  
Concrete should be workable, finishable, strong, durable, water-  
resistant, and wear-resistant. These qualities can usually be  
achieved by selecting suitable materials or by changing the mix  
proportions. Admixtures may be necessary to meet design perfor-  
mance or intent.  
The major reasons for using admixtures are to reduce the cost of  
concrete construction; to achieve certain properties in concrete  
more effectively than by other means; to ensure the quality of  
concrete during mixing, transporting, placing, and curing in  
adverse weather conditions.  
• The effectiveness of an admixture depends on such factors as  
type, and amount of cement; water content; aggregate shape,  
gradation, and proportions; mixing time; slump; and concrete  
and air temperatures.  
• Concrete samples should be made with the admixture and the  
job materials at temperatures and humidity levels anticipated on  
the job, to ensure compatibility with other admixtures and job  
materials and to allow observation of how the properties of the  
fresh and cured concrete are affected by local conditions.  
• The cost of using admixtures should be compared with the cost  
of changing the basic concrete mixture.  
• Recommended total air contents for different exposure condi-  
tions are shown for different aggregate sizes in the Figure 5.54.  
Aluminum powder, resin soap, and vegetable or animal  
glue, saponin, hydrolyzed protein  
Grouting agents Adjust grout properties for specific  
applications \(i.e., non-shrink grout for  
setting steel on masonry or concrete, fill  
reglets and cracks\).

placement, or for special finishing, such as  
exposed aggregate.

carbohydrates \(also tend to retard set, so accelerator is  
often added\)

# CONCRETE TYPICAL COMPONENTS APPLICABLE TO CONCRETE WORK  
Fly ash, ground-granulated blast-furnace slag, silica fume, and  
natural pozzolans are materials that, when used in conjunction  
with portland cement, contribute to the properties of the cured  
concrete through hydraulic or pozzolanic activity, or both.  
Hydraulic materials will set and harden when mixed with water,  
whereas pozzolanic materials require a source of calcium, usually  
supplied by portland cement. Slags and some Class C fly ashes are  
hydraulic materials, and Class F fly ashes are typically pozzolanic.  
Collectively, these materials are referred to as supplementary  
cementitious materials \(SCMs\). Formally, a pozzolan is a siliceous  
or aluminosiliceous material that, in finely divided form and in the  
presence of moisture, chemically reacts with the calcium hydroxide  
released by the hydration of portland cement to form calcium sili-  
cate hydrate \(similar to that produced by cement hydration\). In  
very broad terms, the reactions may be considered to be\:  
Water + Cement → Calcium Silicate Hydrate + Calcium Hydroxide  
Calcium Hydroxide + Pozzolan + Water → Calcium Silicate Hydrate  
Calcium silicate hydrate is the primary compound that contributes  
to strength and impermeability of hydrated cement paste; in con-  
trast, calcium hydroxide is not as strong and is more soluble.  
Conversion of calcium hydroxide to more calcium silicate hydrate  
may, therefore, be considered beneficial.  
Supplementary cementitious materials in concrete mixtures may  
be used in addition to, or as a partial replacement for, portland  
cement in concrete, depending on the properties of the materials  
and the desired effect on concrete.  
Supplementary cementitious materials can be used to improve a  
particular concrete property such as resistance to alkali-aggregate  
reactivity. The optimum amount to use should be established by  
testing to determine\: \(1\) whether the material is indeed improving  
the property; \(2\) the correct dosage rate, as an overdose or under-  
dose can be harmful or fail to achieve the desired effect; and \(3\)  
whether unintended effects occur—for example, a significant  
delay in early strength gain. Supplementary cementitious materials  
may react differently with different cements.  
Architectural concrete and structural concrete are both made from  
portland cement, aggregate, and water, but they have entirely dif-  
ferent concrete mix designs. A variety of architectural finishes and  
colors can be achieved by changing the mix of these three simple  
ingredients. The cost of production usually determines the limit of  
finish choices. There are three basic ways to change the appear-  
ance of a concrete surface finish\:  
• Material variation involves changing the size, shape, texture,  
and color of the coarse and fine aggregate, particularly in  
exposed aggregate concrete, and choosing white or gray  
cement.  
• Mold or form variation involves changing the texture or pattern  
of the concrete surface by means of form design, form liners, or  
joint/edge treatments.  
• Surface treatment involves treating or tooling the surface after  
the concrete has cured.  
Design drawings for architectural concrete should show form  
details, including openings, joints \(contraction, construction, and  
rustication\), and other important specifics. Other factors that  
affect concrete surfaces are mixing and placing techniques, slump  
control, curing methods, and release agents.  
• Choosing a placing technique \(pumping, chute, bucket\) is an  
important step toward achieving a desired architectural con-  
crete surface and finish. Evaluate whether architectural con-  
crete forms can also be used for structural concrete. Verify that  
the vibrators used are of the proper size, frequency, and power.  
• Shop drawings should be carefully checked to determine confor-  
mance with contact documents. Require approval of forms and  
finishes; field mockups are advised, to evaluate the appearance  
of the concrete panel and the quality of workmanship.  
• Release agents are chemical treatments applied to the liner or  
face of the form that react with the concrete to prevent it from  
sticking to the form. The best way to select a release agent is to  
evaluate several products on a test panel under actual job condi-  
tions. The curing compound, used to retard or reduce evapora-  
tion of moisture from concrete or to extend curing time, is typi-  
cally applied immediately after final finishing of the concrete  
surface. Consult manufacturers and the American Concrete  
Institute for more detailed information about the compatibility  
of these treatments and the form surface material or other fin-  
ishes and surfaces to be applied to the concrete.  
Grade 80 Slags with a low activity index  
Grade 100 Slags with a moderate activity index  
Grade 120 Slags with a high activity index  
Aggregate, one of five components of concrete, greatly affects the  
final appearance of the concrete surface. Aggregate should be  
selected on the basis of color, hardness, size, shape, gradation,  
method of exposure, durability, availability, and cost. Aggregate  
hardness and density must be compatible with structural require-  
ments and weathering conditions.  
Sources for coarse and fine aggregates should be kept the same  
for an entire job to avoid variations in the final surface appearance,  
particularly in light-toned concrete. Following are the common  
types of aggregate available\:  
• Quartz is available in clear, white, yellow, green, gray, and light  
pink or rose. Clear quartz is used as a sparkling surface to  
complement other colors and pigmented cements.  
• Granite, known for its durability and beauty, is available in  
shades of pink, red, gray, dark blue, black, and white. Traprock  
such as basalt can be used for gray, black, or green.  
• Marble probably offers the widest selection of colors—green,  
yellow, red, pink, gray, white, and black.  
• Limestone is available in white and gray.  
• Miscellaneous gravel, after being washed and screened, can be  
used for brown and reddish-brown finishes. Yellow ochers,  
umbers, buff shades, and pure white are abundant in riverbed  
gravels. Check local availability.  
• Ceramic exhibits the most brilliant and varied colors when vitre-  
ous materials are used.  
• Expanded lightweight shale may be used to produce reddish-  
brown, gray, or black aggregate. Porous and crushable, this shale  
produces a dull surface with soft colors. It should be tested for  
iron-staining characteristics and must meet ASTM C 330.  
• Recycled concrete aggregate is produced when old concrete is  
crushed. Primarily used in pavement work, this material gener-  
ally has a higher absorption rate and lower density than conven-  
tional aggregate. It should be tested for durability, gradation,  
and other properties, as with any new aggregate source.

Class F Fly ash with pozzolanic properties  
Class C Fly ash with pozzolanic and cementitious properties  
An exposed aggregate surface is a decorative finish for concrete  
work, achieved by removing the surface cement to expose the  
aggregate. Aggregates suitable for exposure may vary from 1/4 in.  
to a cobblestone more than 6 in. in diameter. The extent to which  
the pieces of aggregate are revealed is largely determined by their  
size. Size is generally selected on the basis of the distance from  
which it will be viewed and the appearance desired.  
Aggregates with rough surfaces have better bonding properties  
than those with smoother surfaces; bind is important, particularly  
when small aggregate is used. For better weathering and appear-  
ance, the area of exposed cement matrix between pieces of aggre-  
gate should be minimal, which makes the color of cement in  
exposed aggregate concrete less important.

Typical form liner materials are\:  
• Plyform\: Sandblasted, wire-brushed, or striated plyform can be  
used as form sheathing or as a liner inside other structurally  
adequate forms.  
• Unfinished sheathing lumber\: Used to produce rough, board-  
marked concrete, this lumber can be used as form sheathing or  
liner. Ammonia spray on wood will raise grain and accentuate  
the wood pattern.  
• Rigid plastics\: ABS, PVC, and high-impact polystyrene sheets  
can be molded or extruded to produce nearly any pattern or  
texture. Although typically supplied in sheets of 4 ft. by 8 ft., 4 ft.  
by 10 ft., and 4 ft. by 12 ft., they can be special ordered in  
lengths up to 30 ft. or longer.  
• Glass fiber-reinforced plastics \(GFRP\)\: These look much like  
other plastics but are stronger and more durable, particularly  
laminated GFRP. Extruded GFRP is less expensive \(and less  
durable\). Custom lengths up to 40 ft. are available.  
• Elastomeric plastics\: These rubbery liners, typically polyure-  
thane, are the most costly, but they are very strong and durable  
and flexible enough to accommodate finer details. Standard  
sheets in sizes up to 4 ft. by 12 ft. are available, as are larger  
custom sheets. Typically attached to form sheathing with adhe-  
sive, they are sensitive to temperature change and may deform;  
consult manufacturers.  
• Polystyrene foam\: Single-use liners are used to produce unique  
patterns for specific jobs.  
Joints in the forms and liners must be executed carefully, and the  
liners handled properly to achieve high-quality workmanship.  
Check liners for compatibility with release agents and adhesives.

Patterned forms and liners make it possible to simulate in concrete  
the textures of wood, brick, and stone at a lower cost. The texture  
and resulting shadow patterns conceal minor color variations or  
damage that would be conspicuous and unacceptable on a smooth  
surface. Use of rustication strips at joints in textured liners simpli-  
fies form assembly work.  
The choice of liner material may depend on whether the work is  
precast, cast-in-place, or tilt-up. Thin liners that work well for hori-  
zontal casting may wrinkle and sag in vertical forms, where stur-  
dier liner materials are required. Form liners such as plastic foams  
can usually be used only once, whereas many elastomeric liners  
are good for 100 or more uses, with reasonable care.  
Reusable aluminum wall forms, textured with various patterns, can  
also be used; sections are held together with metal pins. Typical  
sizes are 3 ft. by 8 ft. and larger.  
Making a preconstruction mock-up is helpful in choosing patterned  
liner materials. If built on-site, the mock-up can be used as a refer-  
ence standard for inspectors and workers. If ribbed liners are speci-  
fied, the largest aggregate particle should be smaller than the rib.  
Two standard types of cement are available, offering different  
shades of color\: standard gray portland cement, and white cement.  
Integrally colored concrete is produced by adding mineral oxide  
pigments to concrete mixes made with one of these two types. Fine  
aggregates should be selected carefully, as they can enhance the  
color effect. The amount of coloring material should not exceed  
10 percent by weight of the cement; any excess pigment may

# CONCRETE TYPICAL COMPONENTS APPLICABLE TO CONCRETE WORK  
reduce concrete strength, and strong colors can be achieved with  
less than 10 percent pigment. White cement is used when lighter,  
more delicate shades of concrete are desired, although it is more  
expensive; darker hues can be produced using gray cement.  
• Variations in components of the concrete mix mean that color  
formulas can only be approximate. After a basic color is select-  
ed, the exact shade should be determined by preparing a num-  
ber of small panels, varying the ratio of pigment to cement, with  
aggregate playing a more important role in exposed aggregate  
mixes. To evaluate panels properly, store them for about five  
days under conditions similar to those on the construction site.  
Panels lighten as they dry.  
• Batching, mixing, placing, and curing practices must be uniform,  
and sources of ingredients must be constant throughout a job to  
maintain color uniformity. Avoid admixtures that contain calcium  
chloride, as it can cause discoloration. Clean forms and non-  
staining release agents are vital. Consult pigment manufactur-  
ers’ recommendations.  
• Pigments should meet the quality standards of ASTM C 979. Finely  
ground iron oxides are the most widely used pigments for coloring  
concrete. Colors and their sources include blue \(cobalt oxide\),  
brown \(brown iron oxide\), buff \(yellow iron oxide\), green \(chromi-  
um oxide\), red \(red iron oxide\), and gray/slate \(black iron oxide\).  
• Color-conditioning admixtures offer integral color and have  
additives that improve workability, better disperse color and  
cement, and reduce color bleeding for improved uniformity.  
Consult manufacturers.  
Colored concrete can provide a cost-effective simulation of natural  
stone or other building materials.  
A pearly gray polished concrete floor can be a thing of beauty. But  
the days of gray-only for concrete floors are long gone. The color  
choices for concrete are as unlimited as dreams and imagination.  
Particularly when used with concrete polishing, coloring can pro-  
vide translucent, almost gem-like effects.  
Following are the six most common ways to color horizontal con-  
crete.  
2\. Colorant added to concrete during mixing  
produces uniform color throughout the slab.  
The colorant may be liquid or powder. Integral color is for new  
installations only, and usually only for large monochrome areas,  
since the main application device is a ready mix truck. Integral  
colors are expensive because the entire depth of the slab is  
being colored.  
Shake-on color consists of finely ground  
pigments and dry cement that are “broadcast” onto freshly  
placed concrete. The powder gets worked into the concrete dur-  
ing bull-floating.  
Bleed water from the plastic concrete wets the cement powder,  
causing it and the pigments to bond to the exposed surface.  
Because the pigments are concentrated in the top layer, grinding  
and polishing will remove the color. Since shake-on colors rely  
on water from freshly placed concrete, they are only suitable for  
use on freshly placed concrete.  
Acid stains are formulas of acid, metallic salts,  
and water. The acid chemically reacts with minerals in the con-  
crete, creating a unique, mottled color effect that’s as durable  
as the wear zone of the concrete it’s applied to. Acid stains are  
hazardous materials and require all the safety precautions com-  
mon to acidic products.  
Concrete floors that have been acid stained must be neutral-  
ized and rinsed thoroughly to remove any excess acid. You  
must be careful when handling acid stains, also, because spills,  
sloshes, and drips instantly create permanent “features” in  
the floor. Acid stains can be used for retrofits or new installa-  
tions.  
The benefits of fast-drying solvent-based dyes  
are often overshadowed by the risks inherent with using highly  
flammable reduction solvents. Acetone, one of the most common  
reduction solvents, has a flash point of −4 degrees Fahrenheit  
and an odor and toxicity that makes it impractical to use in most  
occupied spaces. The color usually is applied after the floor has  
been polished with a 400-grit resin.  
Though solvent-based dyes can impart vivid colors, they aren’t  
UV-stable. Sunlight, through a window or skylight, can fade the  
colors. Most require a topical protective treatment to lock in the  
color. Respirators and explosion-proof ventilation are required  
when installing solvent-based dyes on new or existing concrete  
floors.  
Water-based stains and dyes have sev-  
eral advantages. They are odorless, safe and easy to apply, and  
dry quickly. Different colors can be easily mixed and matched,  
creating striking patterns and effects in areas large or small.  
Combined with hardening, densifying, and polishing, water-  
based stains can create a translucent, gemlike effect. However,  
water-based stains must be used with protective coatings to  
lock in the color. Like acetone dyes, they are not UV-stable and  
will fade in direct sunlight. Water-based dyes can be used for  
new installations or retrofits.  
Water-based colors are easily applied with pump-up or airless  
sprayers, followed by spreading with a microfiber pad. The color  
usually goes on before the floor has been hardened and densi-  
fied.  
Color hardeners/densifiers are  
a recent innovation in which fine pigments suspended in water  
are blended by the applicator with a lithium-silicate hardener/  
densifier. This allows hardening/densifying and coloring in one  
step. Apply color hardeners/densifiers to concrete floors ground  
no finer than with a 200-grit resin pad.  
The pigments in these products are similar to shake-on colors in  
that they are surface treatments, so polishing after application  
removes the color. Also like shake-on colors, most are UV-stable  
and suitable for exterior application. While a protective treat-  
ment to “lock in” the color isn’t needed, strictly speaking, pro-  
tective treatments are always a good idea for horizontal con-  
crete, inside or out.  
Concrete surfaces may require a sealer or coating to protect  
against severe weather, chemicals, or abrasions; to prevent dust-  
ing of the surface layer; to harden the surface layer; or to add a  
decorative finish.  
Sealers are usually clear and are expected to penetrate the sur-  
face without leaving a visible film. Coatings are clear or opaque  
and, while they may have some penetration, they leave a visible  
film on the surface. Sealers and coatings should allow vapor emis-  
sion from the concrete but at the same time keep moisture from  
penetrating after curing.  
Decorative coatings usually protect as well, and are formulated in  
a wide selection of colors. Decorative coatings include water-  
based acrylic emulsion, elastomeric acrylic resin, liquid polymer  
stain, solvent-based acrylic stain, portland cement–based finish  
coating, and water-based acidic stain \(a solution of metallic salts\).

tion. There may be restrictions on the use of solvent-based coat-  
ings and sealers in some areas due to the presence of volatile  
organic compounds \(VOCs\).

# MASONRY TYPICAL COMPONENTS APPLICABLE TO MASONRY WORK  
# TYPICAL COMPONENTS APPLICABLE TO MASONRY WORK  
Brick and tile are classified according to the specific location  
where they are used. Standard specifications have been devel-  
oped to produce uniform requirements for brick. ASTM  
International publishes the most widely accepted standards on  
brick. Standard specifications include strength, durability, and  
aesthetic requirements.  
Brick is readily available in many sizes, colors, textures, and  
shapes, all adaptable for virtually any style or expression. Brick’s  
small module can be related to the scale of the wall, and its sizes  
can be combined to create different appearances and patterns.  
Sizes available are shown in Figure 6.5.  
When specifying the size of units, dimensions should be listed in  
this order\: width by thickness by length. The size of the brick influ-  
ences cost because larger units require fewer bricks, usually  
resulting in less labor.  
Specially shaped bricks are available to add interest to a wall,  
including water table bricks, radials, caps, copings, corners, and  
others. Consult the manufacturer for specific sizes and availability.

Terms used in each standard for brick classification may include  
exposure, appearance, physical properties, efflorescence, dimen-  
sional tolerances, distortion, chipping, core, and frogs. Brick may  
be classified by use, grade \(exposure\), and type \(appearance\).  
Properties should be identified. Each ASTM standard has minimum  
requirements for grade and type, which will be used as the default  
property if another is not specified.

Specific grades of brick are required to accommodate the various  
climates in the United States and the different applications in  
which brick can be used. Brick grades include Severe Weathering  
\(SW\), Moderate Weathering \(MW\), and Negligible Weathering  
\(NW\); each is based on the weathering index and the exposure  
they will receive. The weathering index is the product of the aver-  
age annual number of freezing cycle days and the average annual  
winter rainfall in inches \(see Figure 6.2\). The exposure is related to  
whether the brick is used on a vertical or horizontal surface and  
whether the unit will be in contact with the earth \(see Figure 6.3\).  
A higher weathering index or a more severe exposure will require  
face brick to meet the SW requirements. The grades for each  
specification are listed in Figure 6.4.

Concrete masonry units are available in numerous sizes and con-  
figurations to accommodate construction needs. The outside  
dimensions of common units are indicated as width by height by  
length. The nominal dimensions are usually 3/8 in. larger than the  
actual unit dimensions to accommodate a standard mortar joint  
thickness. The most common nominal widths of concrete masonry  
units are 4 in., 6 in., 8 in., 10 in., and 12 in., but larger widths may  
be available. Nominal unit heights are usually 8 in. and 4 in., except  
concrete bricks, which are typically 2–2/3 in. high. Nominal unit  
lengths are usually 16 in. for concrete masonry units and 8 in. for  
concrete brick.  
Specialty units are available for corners, openings, columns, and  
other construction needs. Acoustic concrete masonry units are  
made with slots, baffles, or other features to dampen sound and  
reduce noise within interior spaces. Individual manufacturers  
should be consulted for a complete list of available colors, tex-  
tures, sizes, and configurations.  
The weight of the units also varies. Depending on the aggregate  
used, concrete masonry units are typically made using concrete,  
with densities ranging from 85 to 145 lb. per cu ft. The lighter units  
tend to provide better fire resistance and have a better noise

Concrete masonry units \(CMU\) conform to ASTM standard specifi-  
cations. The most common concrete masonry units used in build-  
ing construction are load-bearing units and concrete brick.  
Load-bearing units are commonly used for structural building  
applications and for exposed architectural facing applications.  
Non-load-bearing units are commonly used for partitions, fire-  
rated construction, and architectural veneers. Concrete brick are  
used for utilitarian purposes.  
ASTM standards include requirements for the materials used in the  
manufacture of concrete masonry units, as well as performance  
requirements for the unit’s dimensional tolerance, compressive  
strength, absorption \(a measure of concrete void structure\), and,  
sometimes, potential drying shrinkage. “Type” and “grade” are no  
longer used in classification of concrete masonry units.  
Conventional gray concrete masonry units are the most common,  
and are frequently used as a backup building material or for utili-  
tarian purposes. When used as an exterior product, these units  
may be prefaced with a resinous tile, painted, plastered, or other-  
wise coated.  
Concrete masonry units are also available in a variety of colors,  
sizes, and textures to achieve a wide range of desired architec-  
tural effects. Lightfast, metallic-oxide pigments are used to inte-  
grally color the units, primarily in a variety of earth-tone colors.  
Significant advancements have also been made related to surface  
treatments to enhance appearance. Splitface units have rocklike  
textures. Tumbling and other methods are used to soften edges  
and provide an aged appearance to the units. Additionally, the face  
surface can be ground and polished. Integral water-repellent  
admixtures can be added during unit production to assist in repel-  
ling water from wind-driven rain.  
reduction coefficient for sound absorption, and often are more  
economical to place in the wall. Heavier units tend to provide  
increased compressive strength, have better sound transmission  
class values to minimize noise penetration, higher water penetra-  
tion resistance, and greater thermal storage capabilities.

# MASONRY STONE ASSEMBLIES  
# GLASS UNIT MASONRY  
Glass block is available in thicknesses ranging from a minimum of  
3 in. for solid units to a maximum of 4 in. \(nominal\) for hollow units.  
Some manufacturers provide thick blocks for critical applications  
where a thick-faced, heavier glass block is needed. These blocks  
have superior sound transmission rating properties, as their faces  
are three times as thick as standard units.  
Glass block is a diverse building material whose many applications  
exhibit its multifaceted characteristics. The varying forms of glass  
block—type, thickness, size, shape, and patterns—along with the  
method of installation can be combined to create unique design  
solutions. Applications range from entire facades, windows, inte-  
rior dividers, and partitions to skylights, floors, walkways, and  
stairways. In all applications, glass block units permit the control  
of light, both natural and artificial, for function or drama. Glass  
block also allows for control of thermal transmission, noise, dust,  
and drafts. Thick-faced glass block and solid 3-in. block are impact-  
resistant and can assist in security applications.  
The basic glass block unit is made of two halves fused together  
with a partial vacuum inside. Units may be transparent, translu-  
cent, or opaque, and may also be colored and/or patterned. Other  
options may be available; consult the manufacturer.  
Solar control units have either inserts or exterior coatings to  
reduce heat gain. Coated units require periodic cleaning to  
remove alkali and metal ions that can harm the coating. Edge drips  
are required to prevent moisture rundown on the surface.  
End block units have a rounded, finished surface on one edge. They  
may be used to end interior partitions or walls, or serve as space  
dividers when installed horizontally.  
Surface decoration may be achieved with fused-on ceramic, etching,  
or sandblasting.

# STONE ASSEMBLIES  
Stone assemblies include both natural and cut stone that can be  
used in many construction applications. The major factors affecting  
the suitability and use of stone for construction fall under two  
broad, but overlapping categories\: physical and structural proper-  
ties and aesthetic qualities. The three factors of building stone that  
most influence their selection by design professionals for aes-  
thetic reasons are pattern, texture, and color. Consideration also  
should be given to cost, availability, weathering characteristics,  
physical properties, and size limitations.  
Stone patterns are highly varied, and provide special features that  
make building stone a unique material. Texture ranges from coarse  
fragments to fine grains and crystalline structures. Texture also  
varies with the hardness of minerals composing the stone. To  
accurately compare stone colors, the rock color chart published by  
the Geological Society of America \(Boulder, Colorado\) is recom-  
mended. Samples also may be used to establish acceptable color  
ranges for a particular installation.  
Pattern, texture, and color all are affected by how the stone is  
fabricated and finished. Granites tend to hold their color and pat-  
tern, whereas limestone color and pattern change with exposure.  
Textures may range from rough and flamed finishes to honed or  
polished surfaces. The harder the stone, the better it takes and  
holds a polish.  
Stone is obtained by quarrying and has two general shapes\: cut  
and rubble.  
• Rubble is irregular in size and shape. Collected natural stone  
includes excavated stone, field stone, and riverbed stone. It may

second type of rubble, quarry rubble, includes the fragments of  
stone left over from the cutting and removal of large stone slabs  
at the quarry. It has freshly broken faces, which may be sharp  
and angular.  
• Cut stone is either dimension stone or cleft-faced stone. Cut  
stone is delivered from fabricators who have cut and dressed  
the stone to a specific size, squared to dimension each way, and  
to a specific thickness. Surface treatments include a rough or  
natural split face, smooth, slightly textured, or polished finishes.  
Ashlar is a type of flat-faced dimension stone, generally in small  
squares or rectangles, with sawed or dressed beds and joints,  
while dimension stone is typically in a larger block format.  
The physical characteristics of a particular stone must be suitable  
for its intended use. It is important to determine the physical  
properties of the actual stone being used rather than using values  
from a generic table, which can be very misleading. Considerations  
of the physical properties of the stone being selected include  
modulus of rupture; shear strength; coefficient of expansion; creep  
deflection; compressive strength; modulus of elasticity; moisture  
resistance; and weatherability.  
In addition to accessibility and ease of quarrying, building stone  
must satisfy requirements for strength, hardness, workability,  
porosity, durability, and appearance.  
• Typically, the compressive strength of building stone is many  
times higher than required by the loads imposed on them in  
contemporary construction. Flexural and shear strength are  
relatively low. Both compressive strength and hardness are  
proportional to silica content.  
• Hardness of stone is critically important only in horizontal planes  
such as flooring and paving, but hardness does have a direct influ-  
ence on workability. Characteristics may vary from soft sandstone,  
which is easily scratched, to very hard stones such as granite.  
• Workability refers to the ease with which a stone may be sawed,  
shaped, dressed, or carved, and will directly affect the cost of  
production. Workability decreases as the percentage of silica  
increases. Limestone, for instance, which contains little silica, is  
easily cut, drilled, and processed. Granite, in contrast, has high  
silica content, and is the most difficult stone to cut and finish.  
• Porosity, the percentage of void content, affects a stone’s  
absorption of moisture, thus influencing its ability to withstand  
frost action and repeated freeze/thaw cycles. Pore spaces are  
usually continuous, and often form microscopic cracks of irregu-  
lar shape. Sandstone and limestone are more porous than  
# STONE ASSEMBLIES MASONRY 111  
granite and marble. Due to its porosity, stone selection should  
take into consideration both application and adjacent construc-  
tion materials, such as sealant, that may cause staining of the  
stone.  
• Closely linked to porosity are grain and texture, which influence  
the ease with which stones may be split, and for ornamental  
purposes contribute to aesthetic effects as much as color.  
• Durability of stone, or its resistance to wear and weathering, is  
also considered analogous to silica content. This is perhaps the  
most important characteristic of stone because it affects the life  
span of a structure. Granite is more durable than other building  
stones because it contains more silica.  
In terms of practicality and long-term cost, durability is the most  
important consideration in selecting building stones. Suitability will  
depend not only on the characteristics of the stone, but also on  
local environmental and climatic conditions. Water is the most  
active agent in the destruction of stone. In warm, dry climates,  
almost any stone may be used with good results. Stones of the  
same general type such as limestone, sandstone, and marble differ  
greatly in durability based on softness and porosity. Soft, porous  
stones are more liable to absorb water and to flake or deteriorate  
in heavy frosts, and may not be suitable in the colder and moister  
northern climates.

# MASONRY STONE ASSEMBLIES  
The three rock classes are igneous, sedimentary, and metamor-  
phic. Despite their abundant variety, relatively few types of stone  
are suitable as building materials. Granite, limestone, marble,  
slate, and sandstone are the most common building stones in the  
United States. Many others, such as quartzite and serpentine, are  
used locally or regionally, but to a much lesser extent.  
Compressive strength may range from 7700 to 60,000 psi, but  
ASTM C615, “Standard Specification for Granite Dimension Stone”  
requires a minimum of 19,000 psi for acceptable performance in  
building construction. While the hardness of the stone lends itself  
to a highly polished surface, it also makes sawing and cutting very  
difficult. Granite is used for flooring, paneling, veneer, column  
facings, stair treads, flagstones, and in landscape applications.  
Marble often has compressive strengths as high as 20,000 psi, and  
when used in dry climates or in areas protected from precipitation,  
the stone is quite durable. Some varieties, however, deteriorate by  
weathering or exposure to industrial fumes and are suitable only  
for interior work. ASTM C503, “Standard Specification for Marble  
Dimension Stone \(Exterior\)” covers four marble classifications,  
each with a minimum required compressive strength of 7500 psi\:  
I, Calcite; II, Dolomite; III, Serpentine; and IV, Travertine. More  
than 200 imported and domestic marbles are available in the  
United States. Each has properties and characteristics that make it  
suitable for different types of construction.  
Marbles are classified as A, B, C, or D on the basis of working  
qualities, uniformity, flaws, and imperfections. For exterior applica-  
tions, only group A, highest-quality materials should be used. The  
other groups are less durable and therefore less suitable for use  
in exterior unprotected areas. Group B marbles have less favorable  
working properties than Group A, and will have occasional natural  
faults requiring limited repair. Group C marbles have uncertain  
variations in working qualities; contain flaws, voids, veins, and  
lines of separation; and will always require some repair \(known as  
sticking, waxing, filling, and reinforcing\). Group D marbles have an  
even higher proportion of natural structural variations requiring  
repair, and have great variation in working qualities.  
Marble is available as rough or finished dimension stone, as thin  
veneer slabs for wall and column facings, flooring, partitions, tiles,  
and other decorative surface work. Veneer slabs may be cut in  
thicknesses from 3/4 in. to 2 in. Light transmission and translu-  
cence diminish as thickness increases.  
II, quartzite sandstone, by 90 percent free silica; and Type III,  
quartzite, by 95 percent free silica content. As a reflection of these  
varying compositions, minimum compressive strengths are 2000  
psi, 10,000 psi, and 20,000 psi, respectively. Absorption character-  
istics also differ significantly, ranging from 20 percent for Type I to  
3 percent for Type II and 1 percent for Type III. When first taken  
from the ground, sandstone contains large quantities of water,  
which make it easy to cut. As the moisture evaporates, the stone  
becomes considerably harder.  
Sandstones vary in color from buff, pink, and crimson to greenish  
brown, cream, and blue-gray. Both fine and coarse textures are  
found, some of which are highly porous and therefore low in  
durability. The structure of sandstone lends itself to smooth and  
textured finishes for cut stone typically used in veneers, mold-  
ings, sills, and copings. Sandstone is also available in rubble  
masonry.  
The most “pure” form is crystalline limestone, in which calcium  
carbonate crystals predominate, producing a fairly uniform white  
or light gray stone of smooth texture. It is highest in strength and  
lowest in absorption of the various types of limestone. Dolomitic  
limestone is somewhat crystalline in form, and has a greater vari-  
ety of texture. Oolitic limestone is noncrystalline, has no cleavage  
planes, and is very uniform in composition and structure.  
The compressive strength of limestone varies from 1800 to 28,000  
psi, depending on the silica content. ASTM C568, “Standard  
Specification for Limestone Dimension Stone” classifies limestone  
in three categories\: I \(low-density\); II \(medium-density\); and III  
\(high-density\), with minimum required compressive strengths of  
1800, 4000, and 8000 psi, respectively. Limestone is much softer,  
more porous, and more absorptive than granite. Although it is quite  
soft when first taken from the ground, limestone weathers hard  
upon exposure. Its durability is greatest in drier climates.  
Impurities affect the color of limestone. Iron oxides produce red-  
dish or yellowish tones while organic materials such as peat give  
a gray tint. Limestone textures are graded as\:  
• A—Statuary  
• B—Select  
• C—Standard  
• D—Rustic  
• E—Variegated  
• F—Old Gothic  
Grades A, B, C, and D come in buff or gray, and vary in grain from  
fine to coarse. Grade E is a mixture of buff and gray, and is of  
unselected grain size. Grade F is a mixture of D and E and includes  
stone with seams and markings.  
Limestone is used as cut stone for veneer, caps, lintels, copings,  
sills, and moldings, and as ashlar with either rough or finished  
faces. Veneer panels or slabs may be sliced in thicknesses ranging  
from 1 in. to 6 in. and face sizes from 3 ft. by 5 ft. to 5 ft. by 14 ft.  
As panel size increases, panel thickness must increase as well.  
Collected and quarry rubble are often used as rustic veneers on  
residential and low-rise commercial buildings. Travertine is a  
porous limestone characterized by small pockets or voids. The  
pockets common to travertine may be filled to provide a consistent  
surface, prior to polishing. This natural and unusual texturing  
presents an attractive decorative surface highly suited to facing  
materials and veneer slabs.  
It is characterized by distinct cleavage planes, permitting easy  
splitting of the stone into slabs 1/4 in. or more in thickness. Used  
in this form, slate provides an extremely durable material for floor-  
ing, roofing, sills, stair treads, and facings. ASTM C629, “Standard  
Specification for Slate Dimension Stone” requires that both Type I  
exterior and Type II interior slate have a minimum modulus of  
rupture of 9000 psi across the grain, and 7200 psi along the grain.  
Small quantities of other mineral ingredients give color to the  
various slates. Carbonaceous materials or iron sulfides produce  
dark colors such as black, blue, and gray; iron oxide produces red  
and purple; and chlorite produces green tints. “Select” slate is  
uniform in color and more costly than “ribbon” slate, which con-  
tains stripes of darker colors.  
Much of the stone that is produced for building construction has a  
sawn finish, but stone may also be further dressed with hand or  
machine tools for hammered finishes, polished finishes, and honed  
or rubbed finishes. Honing is accomplished by rubbing the stone  
surface with an abrasive after it has been planed. Larger surfaces  
are done by machine, smaller surfaces and moldings by hand.  
Polished surfaces require repeated rubbing with increasingly finer  
abrasives. Only granite, marble, and some very dense limestones  
will take and hold a high polish. Power-driven lathes have been  
developed for turning columns, balusters, and other members that  
are round in section.  
Hand-tooling is the oldest method of stone dressing. Working with  
pick, hammer, and chisels, the mason dresses each successive face  
of a stone, giving it the desired finish and texture. Hand-applied  
finishes include the bush-hammered, patent-hammered, pick-  
pointed, crandalled, and peen-hammered surface. Many of these  
finishes are now applied with pneumatic rather than hand tools,  
resulting in a more uniform surface. Ornate carving is still done by  
hand, both for new construction and for restoration and rehabilita-  
tion projects, although it is sometimes aided by pneumatic chisels.  
Sandstone can be categorized by grain size and cementing agent.  
Siliceous sandstone is cemented together with silica. Many sili-  
ceous sandstones contain iron, which is oxidized by acidic pollut-  
ants \(or acidic cleaners\), which turn the stone brown. Ferruginous  
sandstone is cemented together with iron oxide, so it is naturally  
red to deep brown in color. Calcareous sandstone is cemented  
together with calcium carbonate, which is sensitive to acids and  
can deteriorate rapidly in a polluted environment. Dolomitic sand-  
stone is cemented together with dolomite, which is more resistant  
to acid. Argillaceous sandstone contains large amounts of clay,  
which can quickly deteriorate simply from exposure to rain.  
ASTM C616, “Standard Specification for Quartz-Based Dimension  
Stone” includes three stone classifications. Type I, sandstone, is  
characterized by a minimum of 60 percent free silica content; Type  
• Structural bond refers to the physical tying together of load-  
bearing and veneer portions of a composite wall. Structural bond  
can be accomplished with metal ties or with stone units set as  
headers into the backup.  
• Ties and anchors must be made of noncorrosive material.  
Chromium-nickel stainless steel types 302 and 304 and erado  
alloy zinc are the most resistant to corrosion and staining. Use  
stainless steel type 316 in highly corrosive environments.  
Copper, brass, and bronze will stain under some conditions.  
Local building codes often govern the types of metal that may be  
used for stone anchors.  
• Nonstaining cement mortar should be used on porous and light-  
colored stones. At corners use extra ties and, when possible,  
larger stones. Joints for rough work are usually 1/2 to 1–1/2 in.  
and 3/8 to 3/4 in. for ashlar. Prevent electrochemical reaction  
between different metals combined in the same assembly by  
properly isolating or coating them.

# MASONRY MASONRY MORTARING AND GROUTING  
# MASONRY MORTARING AND GROUTING  
ASTM C 270 standard specification addresses four types of mortar  
in two types of specifications\: proportion specifications and prop-  
erty specifications.  
Mortar conforming to the property specifications must be estab-  
lished by tests of laboratory-prepared mortar, which should be  
mixed from the mortar materials to be used in the masonry struc-  
ture. Figure 6.18 provides the property requirements for Types M,  
S, N, and O mortars.  
Although ASTM C 270 uses the same letters to designate mortar  
type under both the proportion and property specifications, the  
properties of these mortar types are not equivalent. A mortar  
mixed to the Type N proportion specification will have a laboratory-  
prepared compressive strength that is significantly higher than  
that of a Type N mortar required by the property specifications.  
Mortars may be made with either portland cement, mortar cement,  
or masonry cement.

Cement-lime M 2500 75 12 ASTM C 476 is the standard specification governing grout for  
reinforced and non-reinforced masonry assemblies. Two types of  
grout, fine and coarse, are specified by proportions of ingredi-  
ents. Both types should be proportioned within the limits given in  
Figure 6.19.  
Grout consists of cementitious materials and aggregate thor-  
oughly mixed with sufficient water to attain the desired consis-  
tency. Grout should be wet enough to pour without segregation of  
the constituents. Grout can be used to bond two wythes of  
masonry, to provide additional material to resist load, or to bond  
steel reinforcement to masonry so the two materials exert com-  
mon action under load.

Portland cement, a hydraulic cement, is the principal cementitious  
ingredient of mortar and grout. Three types of portland cement,  
covered by ASTM C 150, “Standard Specification for Portland  
Cement,” are recommended\: Types I, II, and III.  
The allowable stresses for the structural design of masonry are  
based on the results of tests in which only portland cements were  
used. The use of blended hydraulic cements and natural cements is  
not recommended unless the strength of the masonry is first estab-  
lished by appropriate tests. For nonstructural masonry, such cements  
may be substituted for regular portland cement without testing.  
Hydrated lime, a dry powder, is made by adding water to quicklime,  
thus converting the calcium oxide into calcium hydroxide. Hydrated  
lime can be used without extra preparation and thus is more con-  
venient to use than quicklime. ASTM C 207, “Hydrated Lime for  
Masonry Purposes” designates four types of hydrated lime\: S, SA,  
N, and NA. Because non-hydrated oxides and plasticity are not  
controlled in Types N or NA, only type S hydrated lime should be  
used for masonry mortar and grout.  
Clean, potable water that is free of deleterious acids, alkalies, or  
organic materials is suitable for masonry mortar and grout.  
Many different types of admixtures can be added to mortar and  
grouts. Admixtures are used in mortar to provide color, enhance  
workability, reduce water penetration, reduce freezing, accelerate  
curing, and substitute for conventional materials. Admixtures are  
used in grout to increase fluidity, accelerate curing, and decrease  
shrinkage. Admixtures containing chlorides should never be used  
because they tend to corrode metal.  
Air entrainment has the detrimental effect of reducing the bond  
between mortar, masonry units, and reinforcement. The use of air-  
entraining portland cements \(Types IA, IIA, or IIIA\) and air-  
entrained lime \(Types SA and NA\) for masonry mortar and grout  
may not be appropriate. Two different air-entraining agents should  
not be used in the same mortar or grout. Air-entraining admixtures  
should not be used in structural masonry. Building codes mandate  
lower allowable flexural tension stresses when air-entrained  
cements or lime are used in mortar.

Grout should be mixed thoroughly in a plastic mix suitable for  
placement without separation of the constituents. Add enough  
water to achieve a slump of 8 to 11 in. The compressive strength of  
the grout should match that of the masonry but must have a mini-  
mum compressive strength of 2000 psi.  
• Fine grout\: Can be used for grouting interior vertical spaces  
between two wythes of masonry, or aligned, unobstructed verti-  
cal spaces in hollow masonry units.  
• Coarse grout\: May be used when the grout space exceeds 2 in.  
in width. If the minimum grout space dimension exceeds 6 in., a  
larger aggregate size may be specified.  
These proprietary mortar mixes are widely used in mortar because  
of their convenience and good workability. Masonry cements,  
however, should not be used in grout. The requirements for  
masonry cement are covered in ASTM C 91, “Standard Specification  
for Masonry Cement.” Masonry cements are packaged as Type M,  
S, or N mortar mixes.  
Mortar cements are hydraulic cements, consisting of a mixture of  
portland cement, plasticizing components such as limestone,  
hydrated or hydraulic lime, and other materials intended to  
enhance the properties of the mortar. In this respect, mortar  
cement is similar to masonry cement. However, ASTM C 1329,  
“Specification for Mortar Cement” includes requirements for  
maximum air content and minimum flexural bond strength that are  
not found in the masonry cement specification. Three types of  
mortar cements are specified in ASTM C 1329\: Types M, S, and N.  
Because of the strict controls on air content and the minimum  
strength requirement, mortar cement and portland cement mor-  
tars are treated similarly in ACI 530/ASCE 5/TMS 402, “Building  
Code Requirements for Masonry Structures.”  
Either natural or manufactured aggregate may be used. Gradation  
limits are given in ASTM C 144 and C 404 for aggregate used in  
mortar and grout. Only fine aggregate may be used in mortar; fine  
and coarse aggregate may be used in grout. Gradation can be  
No single type of mortar is best suited for all purposes, but there  
are several rules for selecting mortar type\:  
Never use a mortar that is stronger in compression than needed by  
the structural requirements.  
Always select the mortar weakest in compression that is consis-  
tent with the performance requirements of the project. However,  
this guideline should be coupled with good engineering judgment.  
For example, it would be uneconomical and unwise to change  
mortar types in various parts of a structure.  
If mortar is used with reinforcement in a collar joint or in a cell of a  
hollow unit, then the air content must be less than 12 percent for  
portland cement–lime mortars and 18 percent for masonry cements.  
The use of mortar is recommended only in non-reinforced collar  
joints of 3/4 in. \(19 mm\) or less.  
Following are the recommended uses for different types of mortar\:  
• Type N mortar\: General all-purpose mortar with good bonding  
capabilities and workability  
• Type S mortar\: High flexural bond strength  
• Type M mortar\: High compressive strength, but not very workable.  
• Type O mortar\: Low strength, mostly used for interior applications

6.20 a. This figure does not include many specialized mortar uses,  
such as chimney-reinforced masonry and acid-resistant mortar.  
b. Type O mortar is recommended for use where the masonry is  
unlikely to be frozen when saturated, or unlikely to be subjected to  
high winds or other significant lateral loads. Types N or S mortar  
should be used in other cases.  
c. Masonry exposed to weather in a nominally horizontal surface is  
extremely vulnerable to weathering. Mortar for such masonry should  
be selected with due caution.

the Hot-Dip Process”  
Corrosion protection is also provided by stainless steel anchors  
and ties conforming to ASTM A 580, for Type 304.  
Masonry construction has not always required the inclusion of  
metal components. Historically, composite masonry construction  
consisted of multiple wythes of masonry bonded together by head-  
ers. However, contemporary masonry walls require ties between  
the inner and outer wythes, which are then anchored to the struc-  
tural frame. Many design professionals use the terms “wall tie”  
and “anchor” interchangeably. In practice, “ties” are of a lighter  
gauge material than anchors. Both ties and anchors transfer load  
to structural framing or other structural members.  
The durability of any metal component is usually based on its abil-  
ity to resist corrosion. Since masonry walls are often subject to  
moisture, metal must be protected, either by galvanizing or by use  
of corrosion-resistant metals. The following ASTM standards apply  
to corrosion protection of carbon steel components.  
• ASTM A 123, “Standard Specification for Zinc \(Hot-Dip  
Galvanized\) Coatings on Iron and Steel Products”  
• ASTM A 153, “Standard Specification for Zinc Coating \(Hot-Dip\)  
on Iron and Steel Hardware”  
Selection of anchors and reinforcement is determined by the rela-  
tionship of the masonry element to the structural support.  
Reinforcing bars may be placed horizontally and vertically in  
masonry. The reinforcement may be placed in the cores or cells of  
masonry units or between wythes of masonry. Figure 5.29 includes

b. Area of vertical reinforcement should not exceed 6 percent of the

c. When the following conditions are met, grout can be placed in lifts  
up to 12.67 ft.\: the masonry has cured for 4 hours; the grout slump is  
maintained between 10 and 11 in.; and no intermediate bond beams  
interfere with the grouting operation.

the cross-sectional areas and bar diameters. The use of dovetail  
slots welded on steel or concrete columns requires coordination  
during the steel or concrete fabrication stage. The type of anchor  
specified, including its size, diameter, and spacing, should be called

Masonry ties perform one or more functions\:  
• Provide a connection  
• Transfer lateral loads  
• Permit in-plane movement to accommodate differential move-

• May act as horizontal structural reinforcement  
Masonry ties include unit ties, adjustable unit ties, adjustable  
joint reinforcement, and joint reinforcement.

Masonry tie spacing recommendations are included Figure 6.31.  
The ties should be staggered in alternate rows, and only one row  
of ties should be located in the same bed joint to allow proper  
embedment in the mortar.  
In wall construction in which masonry wythes are built up together  
and the joints align, a single anchor is laid over both wythes. Where  
one wythe of masonry is laid up before the other wythe, or when  
joints do not align, adjustable ties may be necessary.

With proper design and installation, weepholes and vents dis-  
charge moisture trapped within the wall cavity. Weepholes are  
required in the head joint of the course of masonry immediately  
above all embedded flashing, and should be installed at all horizon-  
tal interruptions in the wall. Weepholes should never be located  
below grade and should be small enough to keep out rodents.  
Weepholes may be open head joints, holes formed with nylon rope  
or oiled rods, plastic or metal tubes, fibrous rope, cotton sash cord,  
or cellular material. Open head joints are often fitted with vents or  
screens to keep out insects or rodents. Formed and tube weep-  
holes should have a minimum diameter of 1/4 in., though it is  
important to take into consideration the type of weephole used in  
conjunction with the climate. Open head joints are a preferred type  
of weephole, occurring no more than 32 in. on center, although in  
clay unit masonry they should be spaced no more than 24 in. on  
center. If cord or rope is used, the material should be at least 16  
in. long. Weepholes other than open head joints should be spaced  
no more than 16 in. on center.  
Flashing may be made of sheet metal \(copper, lead, stainless steel,  
galvanized steel, or aluminum\), plastic or composite materials \(usu-  
ally paper-backed, coated, metallic sheet, or fibrous glass mesh\).  
When selecting flashing materials, avoid those that would have  
cathodic reactions with mortar, other metals, or other construction  
materials. The thickness of the flashing material specified should  
take into account the span between embedment, bends, or connec-  
tions. Copper may cause a patina, which may be desirable. Lead and  
galvanized metal may result in some white staining, but this may be  
minimal if coated materials are used. Choose aluminum as an  
embedded flashing only if it is properly coated, so it will not react  
with the mortar. Polyethylene should not be used as flashing unless  
it has been chemically stabilized so it will not deteriorate when  
exposed to sunlight \(ultraviolet radiation\). Asphalt-impregnated  
building paper \(building felt\) is not an acceptable flashing material.  
Adhered flashings must be held back from the face of the wall to  
avoid deterioration and staining caused by high temperatures.  
The various materials and elements used to construct a building  
are in constant motion. All building materials change in volume in  
response to internal or external stimuli, such as temperature  
changes, moisture expansion, and elastic deformation due to loads  
or creep. Restraining such movements may cause stresses within  
the building elements, which in turn may result in cracks.  
To avoid cracks, the building design should minimize volume change,  
prevent movement, or accommodate differential movement  
between materials and assemblies. Masonry control and expan-  
sion joints are types of movement joints that minimize cracks in  
masonry construction. Design of joints should take into consider-  
ation the magnitude of each type of movement that may occur in  
masonry and other building materials.  
Flashing in masonry construction is necessary to collect moisture  
that enters the wall system and to channel it to the exterior  
through weepholes. Moisture enters masonry walls through con-  
densation, penetration of wind-driven rains, failed sealant joints,  
interfaces with other components, or other components them-  
selves, such as windows or roofs.  
There are two types of flashing. Exposed flashings can be applied  
to all masonry construction, while use of embedded flashing is  
usually limited to drainage-type walls. Masonry is a durable, long-  
lasting construction material. Thus, the flashing materials selected  
should also be durable and have a long life, especially embedded  
flashing materials, which are difficult to replace.  
Embedded flashing is typically used in drainage walls at the base,  
above all openings, at sills and shelf angles, and under copings.  
Continuous embedded flashing should be lapped at least 6 in. and  
sealed with an appropriate sealer. Discontinuous flashing should  
have the ends turned up at least 1 in. to form a dam. Dams prevent  
water collected on the flashing from draining off the ends of the  
flashing back into the wall system or into framing or mullions.  
Embedded flashing should extend at least 8 in. vertically within the  
wall system; it should extend at least 1–1/2 in. into the interior  
wythe and through the exterior wythe at least 1/4 in. to form a  
drip. The drip minimizes possible staining. Sometimes, it may be  
necessary to avoid the drip, as with rough textured units and  
ribbed, scored, or fluted masonry units. The flashing must be care-  
fully brought to the surface of the recessed portion of the masonry.  
Plastic flashing is often exposed and cut off flush with the face of  
the masonry. If the flashing is recessed and does not reach the  
surface, water collected on it may be channeled by mortar under  
the flashing and back into the wall system.  
The design and construction of most buildings do not allow precise  
movement prediction of building materials. Changes depend on  
material properties, therefore are highly variable. Material age  
and temperature at installation are two conditions that may also  
influence movement. When mean values of material properties are  
used in design, the actual movement may be underestimated or  
overestimated. Design professionals should use discretion when  
selecting the applicable values. Figure 6.35 indicates the type of  
movement that affects common building materials.  
There are various types of movement joints in buildings\: expansion  
joints, control joints, separation joints, and construction joints.  
Each type of movement joint is designed to perform a specific task;  
they should not be used interchangeably.  
Control joints are used to separate masonry into segments to  
minimize cracking due to changes in temperature, moisture expan-  
sion, elastic deformation due to loads, and shrinkage and creep in  
concrete framed buildings. Control joints may be horizontal or  
vertical. They are formed of elastomeric materials placed in a  
continuous, unobstructed opening through the masonry wythe. This  
construction allows the joint to compress with movement of mate-  
rials. Control joints must be located so the structural integrity of  
the masonry is not compromised.  
Expansion \(isolation\) joints are used to separate a building into  
discrete structural sections so that stresses developed in one sec-  
tion will not affect the integrity of the entire structure. The expan-  
sion joint is a through-the-building joint, including the roof assembly.  
Separation joints are joints between dissimilar materials such as  
openings and adjacent masonry construction. These joints accom-  
modate differential movement in building materials.  
A construction \(cold\) joint is used primarily in concrete construc-  
tion when construction work is interrupted. Construction joints are  
located where they will least impair the strength of the structure.

No single recommendation on the positioning and spacing of con-  
trol and expansion joints can be applicable to all structures. Each  
building should be analyzed to determine the extent of movement  
expected within that particular structure. Provisions should be  
made to accommodate these movements and their associated  
stresses with a series of control and expansion joints.  
Generally, spacing of control joints is determined by considering  
the amount of expected wall movement and the size of the control  
joint. Recommended spacing of control joints in concrete unit  
masonry is addressed in Figure 6.39. Control joints are often sized  
to resemble a mortar joint, usually 3/8 in. to 1/2 in.  
Expansion joints may use sealant or preformed filler. Maximum sealant  
joint size is approximately 2 in. with 50 percent movement, thus when  
expansion joints are over 3 in. in width, preformed fillers are common.  
Control and expansion joints do not have to be aligned in cavity  
walls; however, they should be aligned in multiwythe walls.

when laying masonry. The most common bond pattern is the run-  
ning bond for both exposed and unexposed masonry. Combination  
of various bond patterns produce more aesthetically interesting

# METALS COMMON CHARACTERISTICS, STANDARDS, AND PRACTICES  
# COMMON CHARACTERISTICS, STANDARDS, AND PRACTICES  
Metals and their alloys are classified in two broad categories\: fer-  
rous and nonferrous. Ferrous metals’ main component is iron, and  
nonferrous metal alloys normally do not contain iron.  
Iron, steel, and their alloys are usually the most cost-effective  
metal choice for structural applications.  
Iron that contains no trace of carbon is soft, ductile, and easily  
worked, but it rusts in a relatively short period of time and is sus-  
ceptible to corrosion by most acids.  
The characteristics of cast iron vary widely among the six basic  
types\: gray, malleable, ductile, white, compacted graphite, and  
high-alloy iron. All cast irons have high compressive strengths, but  
tensile and yield strengths vary widely depending on basic type.  
Cast iron is relatively corrosion-resistant but cannot be hammered  
or beaten into shapes.  
Gray irons are rather brittle because they have a high carbon and  
silicon content. However, castings of gray iron are excellent for  
damping purposes \(i.e., absorbing vibrations\). They are produced in  
eight ASTM classes or grades, with tensile-strength ratings from  
20,000 to 60,000 psi. Applications include decorative shapes, such  
as fences and posts, gratings, and stair components, as well as  
utility uses such as manhole covers and fire hydrants.  
Malleable iron, which is more expensive than gray iron, has been  
used for decades in applications that require durability and high  
ductility. This low-carbon white iron is cast, reheated, and slowly  
cooled, or annealed, to improve its workability.  
Ductile iron is made by adding magnesium to molten iron shortly  
before the metal is poured into molds. The magnesium alters the  
surface-tension mechanism of the molten iron and precipitates the  
carbon out as small spheres, instead of flakes, which make the iron  
casting more ductile. Ductile iron is less brittle, stiffer, stronger,  
and more shock-resistant than gray iron. Ductile iron castings are  
more expensive than gray iron but usually less than malleable iron.  
Ductile iron is the fastest-growing segment of the metal casting  
industry.  
Ductile irons are produced in strength ratings from 55,000 to  
130,000 psi. Ductile castings using a special austempering heat-  
treating process offer much higher tensile strengths, ranging from  
125,000 to 230,000 psi. Called ADI castings, they rival or surpass  
certain alloy steel castings in tensile and yield strengths.  
White iron castings, which are extremely hard and brittle, are used  
primarily in industrial machinery parts that experience high wear  
and require abrasion resistance.  
The characteristics of compacted graphite iron fall between those  
of gray and ductile iron. The properties of this metal are so difficult  
to control during production that very few metal casters manufac-  
ture it.  
High-alloy irons are gray, ductile, or white irons with an alloy con-  
tent of 3 percent to more than 30 percent. Their properties are  
significantly different from those of unalloyed irons.  
Wrought iron or steel is relatively soft, corrosion- and fatigue-  
resistant, and machinable. It is easily worked, making it ideal for  
railings, grilles, fences, screens, and various types of decorative  
metal. It is commercially available in bars, rods, tubing, sheets,  
and plates.  
Carbon steel is iron that contains low to medium amounts of car-  
bon. Higher carbon content increases metal strength and hardness  
but reduces its ductility and weldability. The corrosion resistance of  
carbon steels is improved by galvanizing, which is a hot-zinc dip-  
ping process, or applying an organic coating. Some architectural  
uses include structural shapes such as welded fabrications or  
castings, metal framing and joists, fasteners, wall grilles, and ceil-  
ing suspension grids.  
High-strength low-alloy \(HSLA\) steels have better corrosion resis-  
tance than carbon steels, and they are chosen when weight is a  
consideration and higher strength is specified. Low-alloy steels are  
seldom used in exterior architectural applications that involve water  
runoff because adjacent materials could become stained with rust.  
Typical elements used to modify steel include the following\:  
• Aluminum, for surface hardening  
• Chromium, for corrosion resistance  
• Copper, for atmospheric corrosion resistance  
• Manganese in small amounts, for additional hardening; in larger  
amounts, for better wear resistance  
• Molybdenum, combined with other metals such as chromium  
and nickel, to increase corrosion resistance and raise tensile  
strength without reducing ductility  
• Nickel, to increase tensile strength without reducing ductility; in  
high concentrations, nickel improves corrosion resistance.  
• Silicon, to strengthen low-alloy steels and improve oxidation  
resistance; larger amounts produce hard, brittle castings that  
are resistant to corrosive chemicals.  
• Sulfur, for free machining  
• Titanium, to prevent intergranular corrosion of stainless steels  
• Tungsten, vanadium, and cobalt for hardness and corrosion  
resistance  
Stainless steels are at least 11.5 percent chromium. Nickel is  
added to boost atmospheric corrosion resistance; molybdenum is  
added when maximum corrosion resistance is needed, such as  
when iron will come into contact with saltwater. Stainless steel is  
used in construction for flashing, coping, fasciae, wall panels, floor  
plates, gratings, handrails, hardware, fasteners, and anchors.  
Decorative shapes and statuary can be cast in stainless steel.  
Aluminum and its alloys, numbering in the hundreds, are widely avail-  
able in common commercial forms. Aluminum alloy sheets can be  
formed, drawn, stamped, or spun. Many wrought or cast aluminum  
alloys can be welded, brazed, or soldered, and aluminum surfaces  
readily accept a wide variety of finishes, both mechanical and chemical.  
Although it is light in weight, commercially pure aluminum has a  
tensile strength of about 13,000 psi. Most aluminum alloys lose  
strength at elevated temperatures. At subzero temperatures, on  
the other hand, aluminum is stronger than at room temperature  
but no less ductile. Cold-forming the metal may nearly double its  
tensile strength. Aluminum can be further strengthened by alloying  
it with other elements such as manganese, silicon, copper, magne-  
sium, zinc, or lithium. The manganese-based aluminum alloy 3003  
is used for roofing, sheet metal, siding, and electrical conduit.  
Nonferrous metals and their alloys can be categorized into seven  
major groups for architectural applications\: those based on alumi-  
num, copper \(pure copper, brasses, and bronzes\), lead, zinc, tin,  
nickel, and magnesium. Another approach is to divide nonferrous  
alloys into two groups\: heavy metals \(copper-, zinc-, lead-, and  
nickel-based\) and light metals \(aluminum- and magnesium-based\).  
Good thermal and electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, and  
easy forming and joining make copper and its alloys useful in con-  
struction. However, copper and many of its alloys have relatively low  
strength-to-weight ratios, and their strength is even further reduced  
at elevated temperatures. These metals are offered in rod, plate,  
strip, sheet, and tube shapes; forgings; castings; and electrical wire.  
These metals can be grouped according to composition in several  
general categories\: copper, high-copper alloys, and many types of  
brass and bronze. Monel metal is a copper-nickel alloy that offers  
excellent corrosion resistance, and is often used for corrosion-  
resistant fasteners.  
Bronze was originally a copper-tin alloy, but today aluminum bronz-  
es, silicon bronzes, and leaded phosphor bronzes are more com-  
mon. Phosphor bronze is a copper-tin-phosphorus alloy; and leaded  
phosphor bronze is composed of copper, lead, tin, and phosphorus.  
Brass is copper with zinc as its principal alloying element. It is  
important to know that some brass alloys may be called bronzes  
even though they have little or no tin in them. Some common non-  
bronze brass alloys are commercial bronze \(90 percent copper,  
10 percent zinc\), naval brass \(60 percent copper, 29 percent zinc,  
and 1 percent tin\), Muntz metal \(60 percent copper, 40 percent  
zinc\), and manganese bronze \(58 percent copper, 39 percent zinc,  
and 1 percent tin and iron\). When a metal is identified as bronze,  
the alloy may not contain zinc or nickel; if it does, it is probably  
brass. Architectural brasses and bronzes are actually all brasses;  
they are used for doors, windows, door and window frames, rail-  
ings, trim and grilles, and finish hardware. Muntz metal, also called  
malleable brass, is a bronze alloy resembling extruded architec-  
tural bronze in color. It is available in sheet and strip and is used  
in flat surfaces in architectural compositions in connection with  
extruded architectural bronze.  
Copper-based alloys characteristically form adherent films that are  
relatively impervious to corrosion and protect the base metal from  
further attack. In exterior applications certain alloys darken rather  
rapidly, from brown to black. Under most outdoor weather condi-  
tions, however, copper surfaces, such as roofs or statuary, develop  
a blue-green patina. Lacquer coatings can help retain the original  
alloy color.

The nonferrous metal workhorse for architectural applications is  
aluminum. It has good forming and casting characteristics and  
offers good corrosion resistance. When exposed to air, aluminum  
does not oxidize progressively because a hard, thin oxide coating  
forms on the surface and seals the metal from its environment.

An extremely dense metal, lead is corrosion-resistant and easily  
worked. Alloys are added to it to improve properties such as hard-  
ness and strength. Typical applications of lead include roof and wall  
accessories, sound and vibration control, and radiation protection.  
It can be combined with tin alloy to plate iron or steel, which is  
commonly called terneplate.  
It is important to note that lead vapors and dust are toxic if  
ingested, so care must be taken regarding how and where this  
metal is used.

Although it is corrosion-resistant in water and air, zinc is brittle and  
low in strength. Its major use is in galvanizing \(dipping hot iron or  
steel in molten zinc\), although zinc is also used to create sand-cast  
or die-cast components. Major building industry uses are roofing,  
flashing, nails, plumbing hardware, galvanizing structural compo-  
nents, and decorative shapes.

differences in ion concentration, oxygen concentration, or foreign  
matter adhering to the surface.  
Hot-dip galvanized steel is well suited for use in a variety of envi-  
ronments and fabrications, and sometimes is placed in contact  
with different metals including, among others, stainless steel,  
aluminum, copper and weathering steel.  
Metals near each other in the galvanic series have little effect on  
each other. Generally, as the separation between metals in the  
series increases, the corroding effect on the metal higher in the  
series increases as well.  
Corrosion, which is caused by galvanic action, occurs between dis-  
similar metals or between metals and other materials when suffi-  
cient moisture is present to carry an electrical current. The galvanic  
series shown in Figure 7.3 is a useful indicator of corrosion suscep-  
tibility caused by galvanic action. The metals listed are arranged in  
order from the least noble \(most reactive to corrosion\) to the most  
noble \(least reactive to corrosion\). The farther apart two metals are  
on the list, the greater the deterioration of the less noble metal will  
be if the two come in contact under adverse conditions.  
Metal deterioration also occurs when metal comes in contact with  
chemically active materials, particularly when moisture is present.  
For example, aluminum corrodes when in direct contact with con-  
crete or mortar, and steel corrodes when in contact with certain  
treated woods.  
Pitting and concentration cell corrosion are other types of metal  
deterioration. Pitting takes place when particles or bubbles of gas  
are deposited on a metal surface. Oxygen deficiency under these  
deposits sets up anodic areas, which cause pitting. Concentration  
cell corrosion is similar to galvanic corrosion; the difference is in  
the electrolytes. Concentration cell corrosion can be produced by  
Many different manufacturing processes are applied to metal to  
produce structural forms and shapes required in the construction  
and ornamentation of buildings.  
Rolling hot or cold metal between pressurized rollers produces  
most of the readily available, standard construction material  
shapes. Baked enamel-coated aluminum is cold rolled to make sid-  
ing and gutters.  
In the extruding process, heated metal ingots or bars are pushed  
through a die orifice to produce a wide variety of simple and com-  
plex shapes. Sizes are limited only by the size or capacity of the die.  
Casting is a process in which molten metal is poured into molds or  
forced into dies and allowed to solidify in the shape of the mold or  
die. The casting process is used with virtually all metals; however,  
surface quality and physical characteristics are greatly affected by  
the metal alloy and casting process selected. Almost all metals can  
be cast in sand molds. Only aluminum, zinc, and magnesium are  
ordinarily cast in metal dies in what is called either a die-casting or  
permanent-mold process. Round, hollow building products such as  
cast-iron pipe for plumbing and sewer applications are made by  
centrifugal casting machines.  
In the drawing process, either hot or cold metal is pulled through  
dies that alter or reduce its cross-sectional shape to produce  
architectural product configurations. Common drawn products are  
sheets, tubes, pipes, rods, bars, and wires. Drawing can be used  
with all metals except iron.  
Forging is the process of hammering hot metal or pressing cold  
metal to a desired shape in dies of a harder metal. The process  
usually improves the strength and surface characteristics of the  
metal. Aluminum, copper, and steel can be forged.  
Machining is used to finish areas of castings or forgings that  
require highly precise fits or contours. Shapes can also be  
machined from heavy plate or solid blocks of metal.  
Bending produces curved shapes in tubing, pipe, and extrusions.  
Brake forming of metal plate or sheet metal is a process of succes-  
sive pressings to achieve shapes with straight-line angles.  
In the spinning process, ductile types of sheet metal \(usually  
copper or aluminum\) are shaped with tools while being spun on  
an axis.  
Embossing and coining stamps metal with textured or raised  
patterns.  
Blanking shears, saws, or cuts metal sheets with a punch press to  
achieve a desired configuration.  
Perforating punches or drills holes through flat plate or sheet  
metal.  
Piercing punches holes through metal without removing any of the  
metal.  
Fusion welding is used to join metal pieces by melting filler metal  
\(welding rod\) and the adjacent edges briefly with a torch and  
then allowing the molten metal to solidify. Two common types of  
fusion welding are electric-arc and gas. Electric-arc or metallic-  
arc welding normally uses metal welding rods as electrodes in  
the welding tool.  
Gas welding is also known as oxyacetylene welding because it uses  
a mixture of oxygen and acetylene to fuel the flames produced by  
the blowtorch. Oxyacetylene blowtorches are widely used in con-  
struction work to cut through metal structural beams and metal  
plates.  
Soldering is a metal joining process that uses either hard or soft  
solder. The metal pieces being joined together do not melt as they  
do in the welding process because solders melt at much lower  
temperatures. Soft solders consist of tin with a high percentage of  
lead, and melt at temperatures of 360° to 370°F. Hard solders are  
composed of tin and a low content of antimony or silver, and melt  
at temperatures ranging from 430° to 460°F.  
Brazing, which is sometimes called hard soldering, also joins two  
pieces of metal together by torch melting a filler rod material  
between them. The filler has a high content of copper and melts  
between 800° and 900°F.

process itself or a subsequent procedure is performed either  
before or after the metal is fabricated into an end-use product.  
• Chemical finishes are achieved by means of chemicals, which  
may or may not have a physical effect on the surface of the  
metal.  
• Coatings are applied as finishes, either to the metal stock or the  
fabricated product. These coatings either change the metal  
itself, through a process of chemical or electrochemical conver-  
sion, or they are simply applied to the metal surface.  
Application environments, service requirements, and aesthetics  
together determine which metal finish or coating is best to specify.  
Finishes are usually selected for both appearance and function;  
chromium plating on metal bathroom water faucets and handles, or  
baked enamel on sheet metal lighting fixtures, for example, must  
be attractive as well as functionally protective.  
For structural and exterior metal building products, such as struc-  
tural metal framing, steel siding, and exterior lighting, function and  
operating environments are more important criteria. From a  
design standpoint, it is important to recognize how finishes and  
coatings resist wear and corrosion. To choose the right coating or  
finish, design professionals must understand which material or  
process is best suited for a specific application.  
surface of a metal for painting or for receiving another type of  
finish, but they are also used to produce a patina or statuary finish.  
A component is treated with a diluted solution of phosphoric acid  
or sulfuric acid and other chemicals that convert the surface of the  
metal to an integral, mildly protective layer of insoluble crystalline  
phosphate or sulphate. Such coatings can be applied by either  
spray or immersion and provide temporary resistance in a mildly  
corrosive environment. They can be used for gray, ductile, and mal-  
leable iron castings as well as steel castings, forgings, or weld-  
ments, such as railings and outdoor furniture.

CNC \(Computer Numerical Control\) machining starts with a block of  
raw stock metal. Computer-controlled machining centers that have  
the combined capabilities of lathes, mills, routers, and/or grinders  
use rotating tools to create parts. The tools follow toolpaths gener-  
ated by computers. Some CNC machine centers can turn and rotate  
the original work piece so that material can be removed from all  
six sides of a bar or block of metal. And parts can be machined out  
of both hard metals \(steel and stainless steel\) and soft metals  
\(aluminum, brass, and copper\).  
There is no need to make a mold, enabling CNC machining to be  
cost effective and have the fastest lead times for low volumes for  
metal prototypes and parts. And because molds are not needed,  
draft and other moldability features are eliminated. Plus, CNC can  
easily create undercut features without affecting costs as signifi-  
cantly as it does with molding. CNC works with a wide variety of  
metals, giving designers flexibility and options. For example, if a  
part needs to resist corrosion, the part can be CNC machined out  
of stainless steel or aluminum. If lightweight is a goal, CNC parts  
can be machined out of aluminum or magnesium. Parts can also be  
precisely formed, with tolerances of +/– 0.005 and surface fin-  
ishes that are superior to other rapid prototyping methods.  
CNC machining is widely used by nearly all manufacturing  
industries—especially medical, computer/electronics, automotive,  
and aerospace. Aerospace engineers, for example, use it because  
it is well suited to making parts with strength and light weight but  
are only needed in low volumes. And biomedical engineers specify  
machined metal parts for a wide variety of devices including surgi-  
cal tools and diagnostic equipment.  
Mechanical finishes fall into the following five categories\:  
As-fabricated finishes are the texture and surface appearance  
given to a metal by the fabrication process.  
Buffed finishes are produced by successive polishing and buffing  
operations using fine abrasives, lubricants, and soft fabric wheels.  
Polishing and buffing improve edge and surface finishes and ren-  
der many types of cast parts more durable, efficient, and safe.  
Patterned finishes are available in various textures and designs.  
They are produced by passing an as-fabricated sheet between two  
matched-design rollers, embossing patterns on both sides of the  
sheet, or between a smooth roller and a design roller, embossing  
or coining on one side of the sheet only.  
Directional textured finishes are produced by making tiny parallel  
scratches on the metal surface using a belt or wheel and fine  
abrasive, or by hand-rubbing with steel wool. Metal treated this  
way has a smooth, satin sheen.  
Peened finishes are achieved by firing a stream of small steel shot  
at a metal surface at high velocity. The primary aim of shot-peening  
is to increase the fatigue strength of the component; the decora-  
tive finish is a by-product. Other nondirectional textured finishes  
are produced by blasting metal, under controlled conditions, with  
silica sand, glass beads, and aluminum oxide.

The finishes commonly used on architectural metals fall into three  
categories\:  
• Mechanical finishes are the result of physically changing the  
surface of the metal through mechanical means. The forming  
Chemical finishes are produced in four ways.  
Chemical cleaning cleanses the metal surface without affecting it  
in any other way. This finish is achieved with chlorinated and hydro-  
carbon solvents and inhibited chemical cleaners or solvents \(for  
aluminum and copper\) and pickling, chlorinated, and alkaline solu-  
tions \(for iron and steel\).  
Etched finishes produce a matte, frosted surface with varying  
degrees of roughness by treating the metal with an acid \(sulfuric  
and nitric acid\) or alkali solution.  
The bright finish process, not widely used, involves chemical or  
electrolytic brightening of a metal surface, typically aluminum.  
Conversion coating is usually categorized as a chemical finish, but  
since a layer or coating is produced by a chemical reaction, it could  
be considered a coating. Conversion coatings typically prepare the  
Organic coatings on metal can provide protection and may also be  
decorative. When protection is the sole purpose, primers or under-  
coats, pigmented topcoats in hidden areas, and clear finishes are  
used. Organic coatings used for decorative and protective applica-  
tions include pigmented coatings, clear finishes used for gloss, and  
transparent or translucent clear finishes with dyes added.  
Organic coatings usually fall under the general categories of  
paints, varnishes, enamels, lacquers, plastisols, organisols, and  
powders. Hundreds of different organic coating formulations offer  
an almost unlimited range of properties.  
Many organic coatings are applied with brushes and rollers, but  
dipping and spraying of coatings account for most industrial and  
commercial building projects. Dipping is useful for coating complex  
metal parts, but spraying is used for most architectural applications.  
Spraying is fast and inexpensive, and new computer-controlled  
applicators can follow even complex curvatures. Conventional  
sspraying, however, has two disadvantages. First, there is no easy,  
inexpensive way to collect and reuse the coating material. Second,  
when solvent-based coatings are used, environmental restrictions  
need to be taken into consideration.  
Electrodeposition, an increasingly popular alternative to spraying,  
is similar to electroplating, except that organic resins are depos-  
ited instead of metal. Electrodeposition is based on the principles  
of electrophoresis—the movement of charged particles in a liquid  
under the influence of an applied electrical charge. Electrodeposition  
offers several advantages\: The coating builds up to a uniform thick-  
ness without runs or sags; very little paint is wasted; low levels of  
volatile organic compounds \(VOCs\) are emitted; and coatings can  
be deposited even into deeply recessed areas of a complex shape.  
Electrodeposition also has disadvantages\: Coating thickness is  
limited, and because only one coat can be applied this way, subse-  
quent coats must be sprayed.  
Powder coating is perhaps the best-known environmentally accept-  
able painting process. It offers three major advantages. One, because  
the paints are solventless, they are safer and sustainable; two, the  
paints cost less; and, three, they are more durable.  
Powdered paints are formulated in much the same way as solvent-  
based paints, with the same pigments, fillers, and extenders, but are  
dry at room temperatures. Heat-reactive or “heat-latent” hardeners,  
catalysts, or cross-linking components are used as curing agents.  
Powder coatings are either thermoplastic or thermosetting.  
Thermoplastic coatings \(e.g., vinyl, polyethylene, and certain poly-  
esters\), as the term implies, are melted by heat during application.  
Before such coatings are applied, the surface must be primed to  
ensure adhesion. Thermosetting paints undergo a chemical  
change; they cannot be remelted by heat. Thermosets do not  
require a primer. Coating powders include epoxies, polyurethanes,  
acrylics, and polyesters.

The two most common methods of applying powdered finishes to  
metal are spraying and dipping, the same as those used for solvent-  
based paint. Electrostatic spraying is used to apply powder films 1 to  
5 mil in thickness. A mixture of air and powder moves from a hopper  
to a spray applicator. The mixture is charged electrostatically as it  
passes through the applicator, causing it to stick to any grounded  
metal object. Powder that falls to the floor is recycled.  
For coatings thicker than 5 mil, fluidized-bed dipping is used. The  
powder is placed in a special tank into which air is blown, turning  
the powder into a fluidlike mass. Objects are dipped in the “fluid”  
and then baked to cure the finish.  
Anodic coatings in the form of oxides are widely used to protect  
aluminum and many of its alloys from corrosion. When the metal is  
anodized in one of a variety of acids, a protective oxide is formed  
on the surface. Depending on the acid, the oxide may range from  
thin and nonporous to thick and porous. Three types of anodizing  
are used for aluminum\: chromic, sulfuric, and hardcoat.  
• Chromic anodizing, which results in a relatively soft coating, is  
the least used of the three types, but offers three important  
advantages. One, it has excellent corrosion resistance, so rins-  
ing is not as important. Two, it is suitable for complex cast  
objects; and, three, it offers a coating of the most uniform thick-  
ness and the most enduring fatigue strength.  
• Sulfuric anodizing, the most widely used method, produces a  
harder coating than chromic anodizing, but it can be scratched.  
It offers a pleasing appearance and can be dyed in several col-  
ors. Corrosion resistance is good.  
Not used • Hardcoat anodizing produces a relatively thick, extremely hard  
coating that can be dyed in a range of colors. Corrosion resis-  
tance is good. Hardcoats are porous, making them suitable as a  
base for paints and adhesives.  
Because all anodic processes produce porous aluminum-oxide coat-  
ings, sealing is usually desirable. The coating is immersed in hot  
water, the oxide is hydrated, and the pores swell shut. Several manu-  
facturers claim that their sealing agents do the same thing through  
catalytic action at lower temperatures. Chromic- and sulfuric-anod-  
ized coatings almost always are sealed, but hardcoats are not.  
Vitreous coatings are composed of inorganic glossy materials  
\(glass\). Porcelain enamels are the most commonly used vitreous  
coating for architectural applications. Although one of the hardest  
and most durable finishes, they are brittle. Deformation of metal  
surfaces can cause cracking and splitting. Porcelain enamel coat-  
ings come in a wide range of colors and finishes and are typically  
applied to steel and aluminum \(bathtubs, sinks, column covers\).  
Embossed patterns and textures may be applied by altering the  
metal backing surface or the coating itself.  
Hot dipping of ferrous metal objects consists of immersing clean  
parts into a molten bath of the desired coating metal. In general,  
molten aluminum, lead, zinc, and some alloys can be applied as hot-  
dip coatings to irons. Each offers specific advantages. Hot-dip coat-  
ings are particularly suitable for intricately shaped cast ferrous items  
such as metal roofing components and nails and other fasteners.  
Metallic plating is achieved by electroplating. In electrodeposition,  
an electrical current is carried across an electrolyte, and an  
organic resin is deposited on an electrode \(the metal object being  
painted\). In electroplating, the metal, such as chromium, is an  
electrolyte. Water usually serves as the solvent in the electrolyte.  
Although chromium is commonly used for plating, many metals can  
be deposited on the substrate.  
Similarly, a wide range of plating quality is possible. For example,  
a thin coating of zinc will protect a metal component from rust or  
corrosion for a short time. Chromium plating, on the other hand,  
protects longer and is more attractive.  
Materials widely used to plate complex metal components include  
bronze, brass, chromium, cadmium, chromates, copper, lead, lead-  
tin, nickel, phosphates, silver, tin-nickel, and tin-zinc. Not all of  
these materials can be deposited on all metal substrates. For  
example, zinc electroplate can be used on steel but not on cast  
iron. Therefore, coating/substrate compatibility is a crucial con-  
sideration in matching coating performance to application  
requirements. Typical applications for plating include food servic-  
ing areas, plumbing fixtures, exterior metal, and architectural  
products.

# DECORATIVE METAL  
Wrought iron is a form of iron with a relatively soft and malleable  
fibrous structure. The term wrought , which means “worked” iron,  
is widely associated with decorative metal. Wrought iron is rela-  
tively pure iron with low carbon content. Iron with such low carbon  
content is scarce today, so most fabricators use steels containing  
combinations of iron with a higher percentage of carbon for orna-  
mental details. Low carbon steel or mild steel is the most desirable  
of these.  
Steel and iron are the metals most frequently used for decorative  
metal work. Other popular metals are aluminum \(favored for its  
light weight and rust resistance\), polished bronze, brass, and cop-  
per. Blacksmiths primarily produce custom work today; a smaller  
proportion of their work is restoration.  
Working with iron is a craft not easily mastered and many may not  
be qualified to deliver a high-quality product. Check references for  
similar types of work on previous projects. Consult the National  
Ornamental and Miscellaneous Metal Association \(NOMMA\) and  
the Artists-Blacksmiths Association of North America for more  
information on references and lists of blacksmith shops in the  
United States.  
NOMMA publishes voluntary guidelines for joint finishes in decora-  
tive work. They are\:  
Finish \#1\: no evidence of a welded joint  
Finish \#2\: completely sanded joint, some undercutting and pin-  
holes  
Finish \#3\: partially dressed weld with splatter removed  
Finish \#4\: good quality, uniform undressed weld with minimal  
splatter

Perforated metals were created to fulfill industrial needs such as  
minimizing the weight of a particular component or controlling the  
passage of fluids or gasses. As an architectural component, perfo-  
rated metals can be used as control devices or simply as decoration.  
Perforated metal panels are considered acoustically transparent  
and may be visually solid depending on the size of the perforations.  
Perforated metals retain a great deal of their strength and ventilate  
well, so they are often employed in furniture and other designs.  
Because they can bend and interrupt wavelengths of many types,  
perforated metals are used to contain microwave radiation and the  
Electromagnetic Interference \(EMI\) or Radio Frequency Interference  
\(RFI\) radiation emitted by electrical devices. Metal is typically per-  
forated with hole-punching machines, which work best on sheets  
.008 in. to .75 in. thick. Specialized equipment is available for thicker  
metal. The intended use of the perforated metal sheet determines  
the size, shape, and pattern of the holes punched. The strength and  
stiffness required vary according to use.  
Perforated materials can be used in different applications involving  
a wide range of geometries, materials, and loading conditions,  
therefore design data are given in very general form. The large  
number of perforating patterns possible with round, square, slot,  
and other special perforation shapes make it impractical to list  
every pattern combination. The numbered perforations listed by  
the Industrial Perforators Association \(IPA\) are considered stan-  
dard. \(For design and tolerances of perforated metals, consult the  
IPA.\)  
Round holes from .020 in. to more than 6 in. in diameter make up  
the majority of all perforated metal sheets produced. This is  
because round holes can be produced with greater efficiency and  
less expense and are generally stronger than other hole shapes.  
Nonstandard end patterns may require special dies. Unperforated  
borders may cause distortions of the finished sheet. Roller leveling  
may be used to correct some of these distortions but may not  
always work.  
Common finishes for perforated material include  
• Powder coat or wet paint on carbon steel  
• Brush-finished, anodized, or painted on aluminum  
• Brite, brushed, or electropolished on stainless steel and brass  
7.27 A straight-line pattern of holes is weaker than a staggered  
arrangement and can stretch the material more. The dark holes in the  
figure indicate the punch patterns.

7.29 Square holes, principally used for grilles and machine guards, offer  
optimal visibility and free area. Typically punched in a straight line, in  
either straight or staggered patterns, square holes make for weaker  
perforated sheets than round-hole patterns and are generally more  
expensive. Sharp corners make square-hole tooling wear out faster  
than round-hole tooling.

# METALS INSTALLATION GUIDELINES AND CONSTRUCTION TOLERANCES  
# INSTALLATION GUIDELINES AND CONSTRUCTION TOLERANCES  
Welds can be placed using various welding processes. The most  
common processes are forms of metal arc or resistance welding.  
Common welding processes include\:  
• SMAW\: Shielded Metal Arc Welding  
• GTAW\: Gas Tungsten Arc Welding  
• GMAW\: Gas Metal Arc Welding  
• FCAW\: Flux Core Arc Welding  
• SAW\: Submerged Arc Welding  
• ESW\: Electroslag Welding  
• EGW\: Electrogas Welding  
These processes are designed to fuse metal. Only in rare occa-  
sions does the design professional indicate which process is to be  
used to make the weld; but the type and size of weld should be  
indicated. The process is typically left up to the welder.  
The two most common types of welds used in structural assem-  
blies are fillet welds and groove welds. Plug and slot welds and  
back welds are additional types but are limited in application.  
Fillet welds join two surfaces approximately at right angles to each  
other in lap, tee, and corner configurations. They may also be used  
in combination with groove welds as reinforcement in corner joints  
and T-joints. The cross section of a fillet weld is roughly triangular  
with equal legs. The length of a fillet weld is the distance from end  
to end of the full-size fillet, measured parallel to the root. For  
curved fillet welds the effective length is equal to the throat length,  
measured along a line bisecting the throat area.  
The cross section of a fillet weld may differ from the right triangle  
model. The angle of the weld may vary from 60° to 135°. The angle  
could be less than 60°, with an acute angle heel test used to prove  
throat size to qualify; it may be greater than 135° if on the opposite  
side of a 135° intersection is a fillet with a 45° included angle that  
can be welded. Unequal leg welds may be used. When unequal leg  
welds are used, the use of the normal throat size as the effective  
size in weld strength calculations will, in most cases, be conserva-  
tive. However, when the included angle of the weld deposit is sub-  
stantially greater than 90°, the effective throat size should be  
determined from the actual dimensions of the weld, according to  
the American Welding Society \(AWS\) specifications.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Groove welds are made in a groove between adjacent ends, edges,  
or surfaces of two parts to be joined in a butt, tee, or corner joint.  
The edge or ends of objects to be groove welded are usually pre-  
pared by flame cutting, arc air gouging, or edge planing, to provide  
square, vee, bevel, U- or J-shaped grooves that are straight and  
true to dimension. The preparation is done to ensure that the base  
metal is welded evenly through the joint. With thicker metal,  
preparation of the objects is required to open the joint area for  
welding. Relatively thin material may be groove welded with  
square cut edges.  
Groove welds will be complete penetration or partial penetration  
welds. The design professional should indicate the penetration  
type. A complete penetration weld achieves fusion of weld and  
base metal throughout the depth of the joint. It is accomplished by  
welding from both sides of the joint, from one side to a backing bar,  
or back welding the first weld.  
backing bars or to gouge weld roots for back welds. The application  
of partial penetration groove welds is governed by specifications  
and may limit the effective weld size or the thickness of the mate-  
rial on which they are to be used.  
Edge preparation of base material for partial penetration welds is  
similar to that for full penetration groove welds, but will typically  
cover less than the full thickness of the objects. The effective weld  
size and, hence, the weld strength of partial penetration groove  
welds is normally limited to less than the full joint thickness.  
The use of partial penetration welds is subject to AWS code and  
other recommendations. It is important to keep the stress in the  
root of a partial penetration weld low, especially if fatigue is in the  
equation. Localized unit stress in the root of a partial penetration  
weld can get to the point of rupture, before the calculated dead  
load on a weld will cause failure.  
Except when backing bars are used, specifications require that the  
weld roots generally must be chipped or gouged to sound metal  
before applying the second weld. For purposes of stress calcula-  
tion, the weld-size dimension of a full penetration groove weld is  
considered to be the full thickness of the thinner object joined.  
Partial penetration groove welds are used when stresses to be  
transferred do not require full penetration, or when welding must  
be performed from one side of a joint and it is not possible to use  
The structural code contains prequalified joint details and prequal-  
ified welding procedure specifications \(WPS\). And though ESW and  
EGW processes are considered code-approved processes, they  
still require qualification of welding procedure specifications.

For additional information refer to ANSI/AWS D1.1, “Structural  
Welding Code-Steel.”  
A weld symbol is composed of three elements\: an arrow pointing  
to the joint, a reference line upon which the dimensional data is  
placed, and a weld symbol indicating the weld type required. The  
tail of the welding symbol is necessary only to indicate additional  
information, such as specification, process, or detail references.  
The arrow indicates the joint where the weld is to be made. The  
basic weld symbol indicates the type of joint preparation, for  
example\: fillet, U-groove, bevel, or plug. The position of the basic  
weld symbol indicates which side of the joint is to be welded. The  
bottom side of the reference line is designated as the arrow side,  
meaning any welding operation shown on this side of the reference  
line is to be performed on the same side of the joint as the arrow.  
When an operation is shown on the top side of the reference line,  
it is to be performed on the joint side opposite the arrow. Unless  
indicated differently, welds on both the arrow side and the other  
side are of the same size. Fillet welds must be shown on both sides  
of the symbol.  
Weld dimensions—which may include size, length, and pitch—are  
placed on the reference line next to the weld symbol. These dimen-  
sions read from left to right regardless of which side the arrow is  
on. The perpendicular leg of fillet, bevel, J-groove, and flare-bevel  
weld symbols must be at the left. The point of the field weld symbol  
must point toward the symbol tail. Symbols apply between abrupt  
changes in direction of welding unless governed by the all-around  
symbol or otherwise dimensioned.  
Weld symbols indicated in the figures and tables of this standard  
do not explicitly provide for the case that frequently occurs in  
structural work, where duplicate material, such as stiffeners,  
occur on the far side of a web or gusset plate. The fabricating  
industry has adopted the following convention\: when a detail dis-  
closes the existing dimensions of a member on the far side as well  
as on the near side, the welding shown for the near side shall be  
duplicated on the far side.

In addition to the basic weld symbols, standard supplementary  
weld symbols are used to provide additional information to the  
user. These symbols include information about requirements of  
backing and spacers or if the weld is to be all around.  
The flush and convex symbols are used to modify the shape of the  
weld face. The flush weld symbol is used if the top of the weld is to  
be leveled off. Contour symbols are placed over the weld symbol.  
Most of the basic weld symbols can be combined with each other  
and with the spacer, backing bar, back weld, and contour symbols  
to create many different welds. For additional basic and supple-  
mentary weld symbols refer the American Welding Society publica-

Nondestructive Examination.”  
size is equal to the weld leg size, assuming that the legs are equal.  
In the rare instance that the legs are not equal, the size is not  
given in the welding symbol; instead, the weld legs are dimen-  
sioned in the drawing to avoid confusion. If there is a typical weld  
size for a particular drawing, the size may be listed in the notes and  
left off of the symbol. If the joint is to be welded on both sides, then  
both sides must be dimensioned, even if they are the same.  
If the length of a fillet weld is omitted, it is understood that the weld  
is to extend the full distance between abrupt changes in the object  
of the joint outline specified by the weld symbol arrow. If the same  
size fillet is required for the full length of all sides of a particular  
joint, regardless of abrupt changes in its direction, the weld-all-  
around symbol can be used to simplify the drawing.  
Pitch is used with intermittent fillet welds to give the center-to-  
center dimension between welded sections. When using pitch,  
length is the dimension of the individual welds.  
The dimensions required for fillet welds include weld size and  
length; intermittent fillet welds should also include pitch. The weld

# WOOD COMMON CHARACTERISTICS, STANDARDS, AND PRACTICES  
# COMMON CHARACTERISTICS, STANDARDS, AND PRACTICES  
• Fire retardance \: Natural fire-retardant qualities and acceptabil-  
ity of treatment vary with species. Flame spread classification is  
the generally accepted measurement for fire rating of materials.  
Fire-retardant treatments and buildup of members can be used  
to improve the fire resistance rating of wood materials.  
• Preservative treatments \: Certain species used for architectural  
woodwork can be treated with preservative compounds to  
extend their life when exposed to the elements.  
Building codes generally categorize wood construction into two  
distinct types\: heavy timber \(Type IV\) and light wood-frame \(Type V\).  
Heavy timber construction, consisting of exposed columns, girders,  
beams, and decking large enough to be slow to catch fire and burn,  
is permitted for use in relatively large buildings across a broad  
spectrum of uses. Its large member dimensions and spans make  
heavy timber construction best suited to buildings with regular,  
repetitive bays. Heavy timber buildings are engineered in accor-  
dance with the National Design Specification for Wood Construction,  
published by the American Forest and Paper Associations of the  
American Wood Council \(www.awc.org\).  
Wood frame construction is made up of nominal 2-in. framing  
members spaced closely together and normally concealed by inte-  
rior finish materials such as gypsum board or wood paneling. Wood  
frame construction, with its small members and close member  
spacings, adapts readily to even the most intricate spaces and  
architectural forms. However, because such construction is less  
resistant to fire than heavy timber construction, building codes  
limit the heights and areas of wood framed buildings. The maximum  
height generally permitted in residential wood frame buildings is  
three stories, although four or more stories are possible if an  
approved sprinkler system is installed. Under many conditions  
wood frame construction can use the International Code Council  
\(ICC\) International Residential Code, which has been widely  
adopted by states and municipalities.  
On the basis of performance per unit weight, typical construction  
lumber is at least as strong and stiff as structural steel. Because of  
its microstructure of longitudinal cells, wood has different struc-  
tural properties in its two principal directions\: parallel to the grain,  
wood is strong and stiff; perpendicular to the grain, it is weak and  
deformable. The strength of wood varies with the duration of the  
load. For short-term loads, such as those from snow, wind, and  
impact, allowable stress values are 15 to 100 percent higher than  
those allowed for normal-term loads. Under very long-term loading,  
however, wood has a tendency to creep, and reduced stress values  
must be used.  
Wood is used as a finish material in buildings of every kind. Even in  
the most fire-resistant types of construction, limited quantities of  
wood finish may be used. With proper protection from fire, water,  
and sunlight, wood can serve as a durable exterior material for  
cladding, trim, and even roofing. For interior finishes, despite  
recent concerns regarding the depletion of rare or old-growth spe-  
cies, woods of many types remain commonly available in solid or  
veneer forms and exhibit a variety of properties including hard-  
ness, grain, color, suitability for different finishes, and cost. Finish  
woods are readily available in many preformed shapes and are  
also easily shaped and cut in the field. Wood and wood products  
may be finished with transparent or opaque coatings or serve as a  
base for applied plastic laminates.  
Commercially marketed lumber includes trees of dozens of species  
roughly divided into softwoods, which are the evergreen species,  
and hardwoods, those species that drop their leaves in the fall. The  
majority of framing lumber comes from the comparatively plentiful  
softwoods. Hardwoods, with their greater range of colors and  
grain figures, are used primarily for interior finishes, flooring,  
cabinets, and furniture.  
When examined under a low-power magnifier, wood is made up pri-  
marily of hollow tubular cells of cellulose that run parallel to the long  
axis of the tree trunk. When the tree is harvested, both the hollows  
and the walls of these tubes are full of watery sap. The tree is sawed  
into rough lumber while in this saturated, or “green,” condition.  
Finish lumber is seasoned \(dried of much of its moisture\), either by  
stacking it in the open air for a period of months or, more commonly,  
by heating it in a kiln for a period of days. During seasoning, mois-  
ture evaporates first from the hollows of the tubes, and then from  
the cellulose walls of the tubes, causing the lumber to shrink. By the  
time the lumber leaves the kiln, it is considerably smaller. Further  
shrinkage usually occurs after the lumber has been incorporated  
into a building, as the moisture content in the wood comes gradually  
to equilibrium with the moisture content of the surrounding air. Wood  
absorbs moisture during damp weather and gives it off during dry  
weather in a never-ending cycle of swelling and shrinking, a fact that  
must be taken into account when detailing wood components of  
buildings.  
Most lumber is surfaced after seasoning to reduce it to its final  
dimensions and give it smooth faces.

The major factors that influence lumber selection for finish wood  
applications, as specified by the Architectural Woodwork Institute  
\(AWI\) are\:  
• Aesthetic characteristics \: Different species exhibit a variety of  
colors, grains \(open or close grain\), and figures \(grain patterns\)  
that are further distinguished by the sawing method \(plain-  
sawn, quarter sawn, rift-sawn\) and finishing characteristics  
\(receptivity to finish processes, such as fillers, stains, etc.\).  
• Availability \: The availability of particular species varies by sea-  
son and popularity.  
• Size limitations \: Some species produce longer and/or wider  
members.  
• Strength, hardiness, and density \: The ability of selected lumber  
to sustain stress; resist indentation, abuse, and wear; and carry  
its anticipated load contributes to its suitability for particular  
uses.  
• Dimensional stability \: Swelling and shrinking due to relative  
humidity and moisture content changes vary according to the  
species and product type.  
• Adaptability for exterior use \: Certain species are more durable  
for use in exterior applications. Heartwood of all species is more  
resistant to damage by the elements than sapwood. The follow-  
ing species are rot-resistant and acceptable for exterior use\:  
Eastern and Western red cedar, redwood, mahogany, and teak.

other defects, or structural properties as measured by machines  
that analyze each piece of lumber.  
Strength and stiffness of wood varies considerably from one spe-  
cies and grade to another. When designing a wood structure, it is  
necessary to know which species and grade will be used. If in  
doubt, base structural calculations on the weakest species, and  
base grade on a locally available species.  
Nailing is the most common method of joining wood framing. Nails  
are inexpensive to buy and install and may be driven by hand or  
with pneumatic equipment. When applied in proper size, number,  
and spacing, they form a strong, resilient joint. Sheet metal straps,  
anchors, and brackets can be nailed to connections where greater  
resistance to tension or shear is necessary. Detailed nailing  
requirements for wood frame construction are included in building  
codes. Heavy timber construction typically relies on bolts and lag  
screws, together with metal connecting devices.  
The shrinkage of wood as it dries is not uniform. Wood shrinks very  
little along the length of the grain, somewhat in the radial direction  
of a cylindrical log, and more in the tangential direction of the log,  
as shown in Figure 8.7. One consequence of the difference  
between the radial and tangential shrinkage is that radial splits,  
called checks, form during seasoning, especially in lumber of  
larger dimensions. In addition, pieces of lumber distort noticeably  
in accordance with their original positions in the tree trunk.  
For pieces of lumber that must stay flat, such as flooring, outdoor  
decking, baseboards, casings, and paneling, vertical-grain lumber,  
which is sawn so the annual growth rings are more or less

As a natural product wood varies greatly in appearance and struc-  
tural properties. Consequently, elaborate systems of grading have  
been established to indicate the quality of each piece of lumber.  
Within each species of wood there are two grading systems, one  
based on structural strength and stiffness, the other on appear-  
ance. Appearance is graded visually. Structural grading is based  
either on visual inspection, the sizes and positions of knots and  
perpendicular to the broad face of the board, is desirable. One  
particular sawing pattern that produces vertical-grain lumber is  
called quarter-sawn. For ordinary framing, seasoning distortions  
are of little consequence, so plain-sawn boards are used.  
A number of accepted wood detailing practices have been devel-  
oped in response to the moisture movement that occurs in wood  
and the distortions that result from the differing rates of shrinkage  
along the three axes of the grain. In applying wood siding, it is  
necessary to use nailing patterns that do not restrain the cross-  
grain seasonal shrinking and swelling of the wood as indicated in  
Figure 8.9. Horizontal bevel siding is nailed so that each board is  
fastened by one row of nails only, creating a sliding joint at each  
overlapping edge to allow for movement. Tongue-and-groove siding  
boards are nailed at the tongue edge only, the other edge being  
restrained by the tongue of the adjacent board sliding freely in its  
groove. Vertical board-and-batten siding is nailed only at the cen-  
ters of the boards and battens, allowing for free expansion and  
contraction of the wood.  
Because wood shrinkage is so much greater in the tangential  
direction than in the radial, plain-sawn boards tend to cup notice-  
ably in a direction similar to the curvature of the annual rings.  
Therefore, plain-sawn decking and flooring should be laid with the  
“bark side” of each board facing up, to reduce the raising of edges.  
On outdoor decks, this practice will also minimize puddling of  
water on the boards. Vertical-grain flooring and deck boards are  
preferable to plain-sawn boards, not only because they minimize  
cupping but also because the tighter grain pattern wears better.

# WOOD WOOD TREATMENT  
# WOOD CLASSIFICATION  
Tree species are divided into two classes—softwood and  
hardwood—but these terms do not describe a wood’s hardness or  
density. Basswood, for example, is classified as a hardwood but is  
actually relatively easy to cut or scratch. Softwoods are defined as  
coniferous trees, evergreens that have needles instead of leaves.  
Softwoods, by far the more widely used type of wood, are used as  
framing lumber and in decorative moldings. Hardwoods are from  
deciduous trees, which have broad leaves that are shed each  
winter; these include fruit and nut trees. Hardwoods are often  
used as flooring and furniture components.

To conserve and preserve wood resources, choose certified wood,  
where possible. Composite and engineered wood salvaged from  
lumber production make use of otherwise wasted materials.  
Reclaimed woods can replace imported exotic hardwoods from  
unregulated sources and markets. Less wood can be used by mini-  
mizing job-site waste and with careful detailing.  
Reclaimed wood can be uniquely beautiful as well as environmen-  
tally friendly. Sources for reclaimed wood include\:  
• Demolition of old buildings  
• Dead, fallen, diseased, or nuisance trees in urban and suburban  
areas  
• Orchard trees cut for replacement  
• Careful reclamation of fallen trees from lakes and rivers  
• Usable wood safely reclaimed from demolition landfills  
• Wood by-products from secondary manufacturers  
Wood in North America is increasingly available from certified  
forests. Major programs certifying forestland as sustainably and  
responsibly managed include\:  
• Forest Stewardship Council \(FSC\)\: International organization  
that requires documentation of the chain of custody of wood  
products as well as product labeling. The FSC sanctions third-  
party certifiers.  
# WOOD TREATMENT  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Wood may be destroyed by decay caused by fungi, by insects such  
as carpenter ants and termites, and by marine borers in saltwater  
exposures. Four conditions must exist before many of these organ-  
isms can destroy wood\: \(1\) a free oxygen supply; \(2\) a moisture  
content in the wood above the fiber saturation point \(20 percent\);  
\(3\) a temperature in the range of 50 to 90˚F; and \(4\) the presence  
of a food source, in this case, the wood. Some insects, such as  
drywood termites and carpenter ants, are able to destroy wood  
that has very low moisture content.  
In most indoor environments, where relative humidity levels are  
generally low, wood will last for a very long time. In certain indoor  
environments, however, and in many exterior environments, wood  
cannot be kept dry or out of the proximity of moisture. Most build-  
ing codes recognize this by requiring the use of preservative wood  
treatment or naturally resistant wood species in building compo-  
nents that come into contact with concrete, masonry, or exposed  
soil. This requirement also covers floor joists and crawl space  
support members within 12 to 18 in. of exposed soil.  
When specifying a wood that will resist decay, the choice is  
between naturally decay-resistant wood and wood treated with  
preservatives. The first requires use of the heartwood of naturally  
decay-resistant woods such as western red cedar, bald cypress,  
redwood, and others that contain natural poisons called extrac-  
tives, which are not palatable to decay-causing organisms.  
However, not all grades or species of these woods are suitable for  
some structural situations. The process for treating wood with  
preservatives is to impregnate the wood with chemicals through a  
pressure treatment process. Nonpressure treatments, such as  
spraying, dipping, and brushing, are commonly used for the treat-  
ment of millwork components during manufacture, field treatment  
of wood during construction, or remedial treatment of existing  
wood that is already in service.  
Several processes are commonly used for pressure treating wood,  
including the full-cell, modified-full-cell, and empty-cell processes.  
The method chosen depends on the desired amount of preservative  
retention. During pressure treatment, the wood is placed in a

large, cylindrical pressure vessel and, depending on the process, a  
vacuum or low pressure is applied. The preservative is pumped into  
the cylinder and forced under pressure into the wood cells. After  
the proper amount of preservative has been injected, the preserva-  
tive is pumped out of the cylinder and, in most cases, a vacuum is  
applied to remove excess preservative. Regardless of which pro-  
cess is used, the wood is generally dried prior to treatment to a  
moisture content that will permit the specified penetration and  
retention of the preservative.  
Penta-treated wood is primarily used for utility poles, heavy tim-  
bers, and glue-laminated timbers. For these applications, penta is  
dissolved in a heavy hydrocarbon solvent, which leaves the wood  
with an oily surface until the solvent evaporates, at which time it is  
possible to paint the wood—although oils may bleed through the  
paint at a later date. When penta is dissolved in a light hydrocarbon  
solvent and is used to treat millwork items, oil-based paints and  
primers may adhere adequately after all of the solvents have  
evaporated from the wood. The color of penta-treated wood  
depends on the color of the hydrocarbon solvent. Lighter oils  
darken the wood slightly, while darker oils make the wood very  
dark in color.  
The chemical formulations used for preservative treatment of  
wood are registered with the EPA, which has approved certain  
uses for various types of pressure-treated wood to ensure safe  
handling and avoid environmental or other health hazards. Some  
guidelines for use and handling follow\:  
• Dispose of treated wood by ordinary trash collection or burial.  
Never burn treated wood in open fires or in stoves, fireplaces,  
or residential boilers.  
• Avoid frequent inhalation of sawdust from treated wood.  
Whenever possible, perform sawing and machining of treated  
wood outdoors.  
• Avoid frequent or prolonged skin contact with penta- or creo-  
sote-treated wood.  
• After handling treated wood products, wash skin thoroughly  
before eating or drinking.  
Penetration and retention are the two measures that define the  
effectiveness of preservation methods. Penetration depends on  
the species of wood, the type of preservative, and the size of the  
lumber member being treated. Some species that resist preserva-  
tive penetration, such as Douglas fir, are usually incised with small  
slits to make treatment more effective. Others, such as Southern  
pine, are easily treated without incisions. While the sapwood of  
some species is readily penetrated, the heartwood of most resists  
penetration \(although the heartwood of all species naturally  
resists decay to varying degrees\).  
Penetration and retention are determined by using a hollow drill bit  
to remove a “core” from a representative sample of wood treated  
in each batch. Penetration is determined by visual examination of  
each core, and retention is determined through chemical analysis  
of the core. Penetration and retention standards are established by  
the American Wood Preservers’ Association \(AWPA\) in an open,  
consensus-based process; these standards are enforced by an  
independent third-party agency approved by the American Lumber  
Standard Committee \(ALSC\). A quality mark outlining pertinent  
information can be found on complying wood stock.  
Inorganic waterborne preservatives are the most popular and  
commonly available types of preservatives used for treating wood.  
They include alkaline copper quaternary \(ACQ\), both copper boron  
azole Type A \(CBA-A\) and copper azole Type B \(CA-B\), chromated  
copper arsenate \(CCA\), ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate \(ACZA\),  
and inorganic boron \(SBX\). All of these preservatives are dissolved  
in water, so after the wood is permitted to dry, the surface readily  
accepts paints and stains.  
ACQ \(Types A, B, C, and D\) are composed of copper and a quater-  
nary ammonium compound dissolved in an aqueous solution of  
ammonia and/or ethanolamine.  
Waterborne preservatives are recommended when clean, odor-  
less, and paintable wood products are required. Wood treated with  
such preservatives may be used indoors if sawdust and construc-  
tion debris are cleaned up. Painting wood treated with oil-borne  
preservatives is not recommended, as it is difficult to use, requiring  
extensive care and an aluminum-based paint. For certain interior  
applications in commercial, industrial, or farm buildings, creosote-  
or penta-treated wood may be used if exposed surfaces are sealed  
with two coats of urethane or epoxy paint or shellac. Guidelines for  
precautions in these cases are outlined in an EPA-approved con-  
sumer information sheet for each preservative treatment.

used alone or are carried in hydrocarbon solvents such as mineral  
spirits or fuel oil, and are used to treat most softwoods and hard-  
woods. Some of the more common oil-borne preservatives include  
creosote, pentachlorophenol \(penta\), copper naphthenate, and  
copper 8-quinolinolate.  
Creosote-treated wood is often used for industrial products such  
as railroad crossties, piling, utility poles, and heavy timbers in  
exterior applications. Creosote is especially effective in deterring  
the attack of marine borers when used to treat piles and timbers  
that will be immersed in salt or brackish water. Wood treated with  
creosote is colored dark brown to black, and usually has a strong  
mothball odor when freshly treated. Due to the oily residue some-  
times found on the surface of creosote-treated wood, paint may  
not adhere satisfactorily. Also, creosote contains volatile organic  
compounds \(VOCs\) and, as such, should not be specified for inte-  
rior locations without adequate ventilation.  
Wood treated with most waterborne preservatives can be corro-  
sive to metal fasteners and connectors. For aboveground construc-  
tion, hot-dip galvanized steel and stainless steel fasteners are  
typically recommended. Joist hangers and framing anchors should  
also be hot-dip galvanized steel or stainless steel. For below-grade  
construction, such as treated wood foundation systems, Types 304  
and 316 stainless steel Type H silicon bronze, ETP copper, and  
monel fasteners are required. Adhesives work well with wood  
treated with waterborne preservatives. Phenolresorcinol, resor-  
cinol, and melemine-formaldehyde structural adhesives are used  
in glulam beams made from treated wood members. On job sites,  
use adhesives recommended for use with treated wood.  
Other issues important to design professionals\:  
• Never mix galvanized steel with stainless steel in the same con-  
nection. When these dissimilar metals are in physical contact  
with each other, galvanic action will increase the corrosion rate  
of the galvanized part \(the zinc will migrate off the galvanized  
part onto the stainless part at a faster rate\). Refer to Figure 7.3  
in Chapter 7, Metals.  
• Galvanizing provides a sacrificial layer to protect the steel con-  
nector or fastener. Greater thicknesses \(coating weights\) gener-  
ally provide longer protection in corrosive environments.  
• Most commonly available electrogalvanized fasteners do not  
have a sufficient coating of zinc for these new chemicals.  
• Aluminum should not be used in direct contact with CCA, ACQ,  
copper azole, or ACZA.  
Most building codes require the use of preservative treated wood  
in certain applications. AWPA has established a use category sys-  
tem and has published these standards in a document entitled  
U1–Use Category System\: User Specification for Treated Wood.  
Wood processing and treatment is regulated by a number of orga-  
nizations and not all regulatory bodies recognize or permit the use  
of the particular preservatives, processes, or the wood species  
listed in the standard. The following is a summary of the AWPA–  
U1categories\:  
• Use Category UC1\: Wood used in interior construction, not in  
contact with the ground or foundations, and protected from  
water.  
• Use Category UC2\: Wood used in interior construction not in  
contact with ground, but may be subject to occasional damp-  
ness.  
• Use Category UC3\: Wood used in exterior construction, not in  
contact with ground. UC3 can be divided into two subcategories\:  
UC3A is wood that is coated and used in a way that permits  
water to quickly drain from the surface, typically used in vertical  
applications and UC3B is wood that is not coated \(except for  
aesthetic purposes\) and may be used in either vertical or hori-  
zontal applications.  
• Use Category UC4\: Wood used in exterior construction and in  
contact with the ground or other conditions that support poten-  
tial deterioration. UC4 can be divided into three subcategories\:  
UC4A is wood used in ground- or freshwater contact; UC4B is  
wood used in contact with the ground in severe environments or  
as critically important structural components; and UC4C is wood  
used in contact with the ground in extremely severe environ-  
ments or climates with an extremely high potential for deterio-  
ration.  
• Use Category UC5\: Wood exposed to saltwater and wood with  
brackish water exposure. UC5 is divided into three subcatego-  
ries, which depend on the types of marine borers present in  
various areas in North America\: UC5A is for wood exposed to  
waters north of New Jersey or north of San Francisco; UC5B is  
for wood exposed to waters south of San Francisco or from New  
Jersey south to Georgia; UC5C is for waters south of Georgia,  
the Gulf Coast, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. Prior to specifying a UC5  
subcategory, it is necessary to determine which marine borers  
are present in the area before consulting AWPA Standard U1.  
Once the use category for each component has been determined,  
the specifier should consult the tables found in commodity specifi-  
cation for the type of component, to determine the appropriate  
species and preservative and retention combinations for that  
component. Figure 8.13 provides examples of applications from  
AWPA Standard U1.

to resist fire damage to a wood structure and its spread to adja-  
cent areas, but the most important is to protect the wood members  
by means of coverings, coatings, or treatments.  
Building construction materials are tested for four criteria related  
to performance during a fire\: fire resistance, flame spread, fuel  
contributed, and smoke developed.  
Fire resistance is the material’s ability to resist burning while  
retaining its structural integrity.  
Flame spread measures the rate at which flames travel along the  
surface of a material.  
Fuel contributed is a measure of how much combustible matter a  
material furnishes to a fire.  
Smoke developed is a measure of the surface-burning characteris-  
tics of a material.  
How fire spreads through wood structures depends on the size and  
arrangement of wood members and the details that restrict or  
encourage air movement around them. Larger cross sections take  
longer to burn. As wood burns, it develops an outer layer of char-  
coal, which insulates the wood beneath and slows burning. This  
“char” layer proceeds through the burning wood at an average  
rate of 1–1/2 in. per hour. Various design strategies can be used  
Modern fire-retardant treatment \(FRT\) of wood consists of pres-  
sure treatment with aqueous solutions of various organic and  
inorganic chemicals, followed by kiln drying to reduce moisture  
content to 19 percent or less for lumber under 2 in. thick, and 15  
percent or less for plywood. All proprietary FRTs must conform to  
Underwriters Laboratory \(UL\) classifications. FRT wood is com-  
monly used in plywood sheathing, roof trusses, rafters, floor joists,  
studs, staging, and shingles and shakes. Fire-retardant chemical  
combinations include zinc chloride, ammonium sulfates, borax or  
boric acid, and smaller amounts of sodium dichromate. Ammonium  
phosphates are no longer used because they cause rapid disinte-  
gration of wood.  
Fire retardants work when fire-retardant chemicals react with the  
tars and gases normally produced by burning wood. The resultant  
carbon char acts as thermal insulation \(greater than on untreated  
wood\), slowing the rate of burning. Gases released from the FRT  
wood are diluted with carbon dioxide and water vapor, lessening  
the chance of flashover, in which wood gases are ignited by high  
temperatures and then explode.  
Interior fire retardants meet Class I ratings, which are required by  
code for vertical exits and special areas. Class II ratings are  
required for horizontal exits, but this rating is rarely reached with  
untreated wood. FRT lumber and plywood are recognized substi-  
tutes for noncombustible materials for insurance purposes. Many  
codes allow FRT wood products for a variety of applications.  
Both the flame spread index and smoke developed index give  
numerical scales for a material’s fire classification. The flame  
spread index is the primary test for fire performance, according to  
ASTM E-84. In the International Building Codes, flame spread rat-  
ings are classified as 0–25 \(Class I or A\), 26–75 \(Class II or B\), and  
76–200 \(Class III or C\).  
A smoke developed index of 450 or less is permitted for FRT wood  
used for interior wall and ceiling finishes. The UL FR-S listing  
applies only to treated products with a UL-723 \(ASTM E-84\) flame  
and smoke classification not exceeding 25 in a 30-minute test. The  
classification applies to the species tested and does not pertain to  
the structures in which the materials are installed.  
Fire retardants come in interior and exterior types. Interior fire  
retardants are used on wood trusses and studs; exterior retar-  
dants protect exterior lumber, siding, roof shakes and shingles, and  
scaffold planking. The latter type offers durable, nonleachable,

long-term fire protection in outdoor or moist \(relative humidity of  
95 percent or greater\) conditions.  
Class C or Class B FRT shingles and shakes may be considered as  
noncombustible materials. For wood exposed to the weather,  
specify exterior-type retardants that retain their protective proper-  
ties under the standard rain test.  
Interior Type A wood is appropriate for interior and weather-pro-  
tected applications with less than 95 percent relative humidity. In  
rare instances, when relative humidity is less than 75 percent, Type  
B can be specified. Interior Type A is used when a wood with low  
hygroscopicity \(the rate at which the chemical draws moisture  
from the air\) is required.  
Instead of solid lumber, it is often desirable to build members of  
treated cores clad with untreated veneers 1/28-in. thick or less.  
Most codes discount this narrow finishing in determining the flame  
spread index of the wood, permitting use of untreated wood in  
about 10 percent of the combined wall and ceiling surface area.  
Sizes and species currently being treated \(flame spread index less  
than 25\) include red oak and Western red cedar up to 4/4 and yel-  
low poplar up to 8/4. Color and finishes are affected by FRTs.  
FRT lumber and plywood can be lightly sanded for cosmetic clean-  
ing after treatment. Painting and staining are possible but not  
always successful, particularly with transparent finishes. Test fin-  
ishes for compatibility before application.  
Treated lumber may be end-cut, but ripping and extensive surfac-  
ing will normally void the UL label. To the extent possible, materials  
should be precut before treatment, otherwise a wood treater  
should be consulted. Treated plywood can be cut in either direction  
without loss of fire protection.  
Intumescent coatings are sometimes used to reduce flammability  
of wood surfaces in both opaque and transparent finishes. Under  
high heat, these coatings expand or foam, creating an insulating  
effect that reduces flame spread. Check local codes before specify-  
ing these coatings because they tend to be less durable, softer, and  
more hygroscopic than standard finishes.

# WOOD TYPICAL WOOD AND COMPOSITE PRODUCTS  
# TYPICAL WOOD AND COMPOSITE PRODUCTS  
• A—Smooth, paintable. Not more than 18 neatly made repairs;  
boat, sled, or router type; parallel to grain permitted. May be  
used for natural finish in less demanding applications. Synthetic  
repairs permitted.  
• B—Solid surface. Shims, circular repair plugs, and tight knots to  
1 in. across grain permitted. Some minor splits and synthetic  
repairs permitted.  
• C—Plugged, improved. C-grade veneer with splits limited to  
1/8-in. width; knotholes and borer holes limited to 1/4 by 1/2 in.  
Admits some broken grain. Synthetic repairs permitted.  
• C—Tight knots to 1–1/2 in. Knotholes to 1 in. across grain and  
some to 1–1/2 in., if total width of knots and knotholes is within  
specified limits. Synthetic or wood repairs. Discoloration and  
sanding defects that do not impair strength permitted. Limited  
splits allowed. Stitching permitted.  
• D—Knots and knotholes to 2–1/2 in. width across grain and 1/2  
in. larger within specified limits. Limited splits allowed. Stitching  
permitted. Limited to interior and Exposure 1 panels.  
APA-trademarked panels may be produced in three bond classifi-  
cations\: Exterior, Exposure 1, and Interior. \(Note\: All-veneer APA  
Rated Sheathing, Exposure 1, commonly called CDX in the trade,  
is frequently mistaken as an Exterior panel and is erroneously  
used in applications for which it does not possess the required  
resistance to weather. CDX should only be used for applications as  
outlined under Exposure 1, below. For sheathing grade panels that  
will be exposed permanently to the weather, specify APA Rated  
Sheathing Exterior \(C-C Exterior under Product Standard PS-1 for  
manufacturing.\)  
Exterior panels have a fully waterproof bond and are designed for  
applications subject to permanent exposure to the weather.  
Exposure 1 panels have a fully waterproof bond and are designed  
for applications where long construction time may delay perma-  
nent protection or where high moisture conditions may be encoun-  
tered in service. Exposure 1 panels are made with the same  
adhesives used in Exterior panels. However, because other compo-  
sitional factors may affect bond performance, only Exterior panels  
should be used for permanent exposure to the weather.  
Interior panels that lack further glueline information in their trade-  
marks are manufactured with interior glue and are intended for  
interior applications only.  
Structural panel grades are generally identified in terms of the  
veneer grade used on the face and back of the panel \(e.g., A-B, B-C,  
etc.\) or rated by a name suggesting the panel’s intended end use  
\(e.g., APA Rated Sheathing, APA Rated Sturd-I-Floor, etc.\).  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Veneer grades define veneer appearance in terms of natural unre-  
paired growth characteristics and the number and size of repairs  
allowable during manufacture. The highest quality veneer grades  
are N and A. The minimum grade of veneer permitted in exterior  
plywood is C-grade. D-grade veneer is used only for backs and  
inner plies of panels intended for interior use or applications pro-  
tected from exposure to permanent or severe moisture.  
• N—Smooth surface “natural finish” veneer. Select all heart-  
wood or all sapwood. Free of open defects. Allows not more  
than six repairs, wood only, per 4 by 8 panel, made parallel to  
grain and well matched for grain and color.  
APA Rated Sheathing, APA Rated Sturd-I-Floor, and APA Rated  
Siding carry numbers in their trademarks called span ratings.  
These denote the maximum recommended center-to-center spac-  
ing, in inches, of supports for the panels in construction applica-  
tions. Except for APA Rated Siding panels, the span rating in the  
trademark applies when the long panel dimension is across sup-  
ports, unless the strength axis is otherwise identified. The span  
rating in the trademark of rated siding panels applies when  
installed vertically.  
The span rating in APA Rated Sheathing trademarks appears as  
two numbers separated by a slash, such as 32/16 and 48/24. The  
Span Rating for APA Rated Siding panels is for vertical installation;  
for lap siding, the rating applies with the long dimension across  
supports. An exception is APA Rated Sheathing intended for use on  
walls only. The trademarks for these contain a single number, simi-  
lar to the span rating for APA Rated Siding. The left-hand number  
denotes the maximum recommended spacing of supports when the  
panel is used for roof sheathing, with the long dimension or  
strength axis of the panel across three or more supports. The right-  
hand number indicates the maximum recommended spacing of  
supports when the panel is used for subflooring, with the long  
dimension or strength axis of the panel across three or more sup-  
ports. A panel marked 32/16, for example, may be used for roof  
decking over supports 32 in. o.c. or for subflooring over supports  
16 in. o.c.  
The span ratings in the trademarks on APA Rated Sturd-I-Floor and  
Siding panels appear as a single number. APA Rated Sturd-I-Floor  
panels are designed specifically for single-floor \(combined subfloor  
underlayment\) applications under carpet and pad and are manu-  
factured with span ratings of 16, 20, 24, 32, and 48 in. The span  
ratings for APA Rated Sturd-I-Floor panels, like those for APA  
Rated Sheathing, are based on application of the panel, with the  
long dimension or strength axis across three or more supports.  
APA Rated Siding is available with span ratings of 16 and 24 in.  
Span-rated panels and lap siding may be applied directly to studs,  
over nonstructural wall sheathing \(Sturd-I-Wall construction\), or  
over nailable panel or lumber sheathing \(double wall construction\).  
Panels and lap siding with a span rating of 16 o.c. may be applied  
directly to studs spaced 16 in. o.c and similarly with 24 in. o.c for  
panel and span rating of 24. All rated siding panels may be applied  
horizontally direct to studs 16 or 24 in. o.c., provided horizontal  
joints are blocked. When used over nailable structural sheathing,  
the span rating of rated siding panels refers to the maximum rec-  
ommended spacing of vertical rows of nails, rather than to stud  
spacing.  
Panels with B-grade or better veneer faces are sanded smooth in  
manufacture to fulfill the requirements of their intended applica-  
tions \(cabinets, shelving, furniture, built-ins, etc.\). APA Rated  
Sheathing panels are unsanded because a smooth surface is not  
required for their intended use. Other APA panels—Underlayment,  
Rated Sturd-I-Floor, C-D Plugged, and C-C Plugged—require only  
touch-sanding for “sizing,” to make the panel thickness more uni-  
form.  
Unsanded and touch-sanded panels and panels with B-grade or  
better veneer on one side only usually carry the APA trademark on  
the panel back. Panels with both sides of B-grade or better veneer,  
or with special overlaid surfaces \(such as medium-density over-  
lay\), carry the APA trademark on the panel edge.  
Plywood can be manufactured from more than 70 species of wood.  
These species are divided, on the basis of bending strength and  
stiffness, into five groups under U.S. Product Standard PS 1. The  
strongest species are in Group 1, the next strongest in Group 2,  
and so on. The group number that appears in the trademark on  
some APA-trademarked panels—primarily sanded grades—is  
based on the species of face and back veneers. Where face and  
back veneers are not from the same species group, the higher  
group number is used, except for sanded and decorative panels  
3/8 in. thick or less. These are identified by face species because  
they are chosen primarily for appearance and used in applications  
where structural integrity is not critical. Sanded panels greater  
than 3/8 in. are identified by face species if C or D grade backs are  
at least 1/8 in. and are no more than one species group number  
larger. Some species are used widely in plywood manufacture,  
others rarely. Check local availability before specifying if a particu-  
lar species is desired.

• Specify performance-rated panels by thickness and span rating.  
Span ratings are based on panel strength and stiffness. These  
properties are a function of panel composition and configuration  
as well as thickness, therefore the same span rating may  
appear on panels of different thicknesses. Conversely, panels of  
the same thickness may be marked with different span ratings.  
• All plies in Structural I panels are limited to Group 1 species.  
Structural II panels are seldom available.  
• Exterior sanded panels, C-C Plugged, C-D Plugged, and  
Underlayment grades can also be manufactured in Structural I

veneer on one or both faces. They are available only by special  
order.

APA Rated Siding Panels can be used for exterior siding, fencing,  
and other external applications. They can be manufactured as  
conventional veneered plywood or as an overlaid oriented strand  
board siding. Both panel and lap siding are available. They are  
intended for use with a special surface treatment such as  
V-groove, shallow channel groove, deep groove \(such as APA  
Texture 1–11\), kerfed groove, brushed, rough-sawn, and texture-  
embossed medium density overlay \(MDO\). Span Rating \(stud spac-

Classification\: Exterior. Common thicknesses\: 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8,  
and 3/4 in. A common misconception involves the use of marine-  
grade plywood in place of exterior panels. Marine-grade plywood  
is uniquely situated for marine applications and is not treated to  
enhance its resistance to decay. Marine-grade plywood and exte-  
rior panels have the same APA Exterior Exposure Durability, and  
both are designed for extended exposure to weather and moisture.  
Marine-Grade plywood has a sanded face and will not be as visu-  
ally acceptable after weathering.

18-gauge may be used with 1/4-in.-thick underlayment. Crown  
width should be 3/8 in. for 16-gauge staples, and 3/16 in. for  
18-gauge. Length should be sufficient to penetrate subflooring at  
least 5/8 in. or extend completely through. Space fasteners at 3 in.  
along panel edges and 6 in. each way in the panel interior, except  
for 11/32 in. or thicker underlayment applied with ring shank nails;  
in this case, use 6-in. spacing along edges and 8-in. spacing each  
way in the panel interior. Unless subfloor and joists are of thor-  
oughly seasoned material and have remained dry during construc-  
tion, countersink nail heads below surface of the underlayment just  
prior to laying finish floors, to avoid nail popping. Joints should be  
1/32 in. wide to allow for expansion and contraction. If thin, resil-  
ient flooring is to be used to cover underlayment, fill and thor-  
oughly sand joints.  
8.29 a. For conditions not listed, see APA literature.  
b. Use only APA Specification AFG-01 adhesives, properly applied. Use  
only solvent-based glues on nonveneered panels with sealed surfaces  
and edges.  
c. If ring or screw-shank nails are not available, 8d common nails may  
be substituted.  
d. If supports are well seasoned, 10d common nails may be substitut-  
ed with 1–1/8-in. panels.  
8.30 a. For carpeting, sheet goods, or other nonstructural flooring  
\(consult the Tile Council of America for recommendations regarding  
ceramic tile\).  
b. Where floors may be subject to unusual moisture conditions, use  
panels with exterior glue \(Exposure 1\) or Underlayment C-C Plugged  
EXT-APA. C-D Plugged is not an adequate substitute for underlayment  
grade, since it does not ensure equivalent dent resistance.  
c. Recommended grades have a solid surface backed with a special  
inner-ply construction that resists punch-through and dents from con-  
centrated loads.

OSB panels that bear the APA trademark are manufactured under  
APA’s rigorous quality assurance program and are recognized by  
the major U.S. and Canadian building codes, as well as many inter-  
national building codes. Each panel is “performance rated,” which  
means the panel meets the performance requirements necessary  
for its end-use application.  
Most North American OSB panels are manufactured in confor-  
mance with Voluntary Product Standard PS-2 or APA PRP-108 per-  
formance standards. Panel applications described in PS-2 and APA  
PRP-108 include floors, walls, and roofs. These standards are rec-  
ognized by the building codes in the United States, including the  
International Building Code and International Residential Code,  
and by National Evaluation Service Report NER-108.

for wood I-joists, materials-handling applications, furniture, and a  
variety of do-it-yourself projects.  
Architectural wood panels are made from wood material that is cut  
or formed into sheet products that are referred to as the “panel  
core.” These sheets are used alone \(with or without a finish\) or  
laminated together with other veneer products to make plywood. A  
wide variety of panels are manufactured using different core mate-  
rials and adhesives or binders and various forming techniques and  
surface treatments. The characteristics of the panels vary with  
these differences in material and construction.  
For closed soffits, use nonstaining box or casing nails\: 6d for  
11/32-in. and 15/32-in. panels, and 8d for 19/32-in. panels. Space  
nails 6 in. at panel edges and 12 in. along intermediate supports  
for spans less than 48 in.; 6 in. at all supports for 48-in. spans.  
Use 6d common smooth, ring shank, or spiral thread nails for ply-  
wood 1/2-in. thick or thinner and 8d for plywood to 1-in. thick. Use  
8d ring shank or spiral thread or 10d common smooth for 2–4–1  
and 1–1/8-in. panels. Space nails 6 in. at panel edges and 12 in. at  
intermediate supports, except for 48-in. or longer spans where  
nails should be spaced 6 in. at all supports.  
OSB panels manufactured in North America are typically 4 by 8 ft.  
in size. Panels for use as exterior siding are also available in narrow  
lap widths of 6 or 8 in. and 16-ft lengths. Because OSB is typically  
manufactured in large sizes, many manufacturers can custom-make  
panels in almost any size simply by altering the cutting pattern.  
Most OSB manufacturers make oversized panels, up to 8 by 24 ft.,  
which are typically used for panelized roof systems or modular  
floors. In operations where oversized panels can be handled, they  
provide the advantage of reducing the total number of panels  
required to do a job, and thus speed installation time and cost.  
OSB can be manufactured with square edges or with T&G edges.  
Panel surface treatments may include texturing or sanding.  
Overlaid OSB for use as exterior siding also may be surface tex-  
tured or grooved.  
Panel cores, which serve as the substrate for laminates and  
veneers on the outer surface, are classified by products and meth-  
ods of manufacture. The types of panel cores described below are  
suitable for architectural use.

Oriented strand board \(OSB\) is manufactured from rectangular-  
shaped wood strands that are oriented lengthwise and then  
arranged in layers at right angles to one another, laid up into mats,  
and bonded together with waterproof, heat-cured adhesives. This  
results in a structural engineered wood product that shares many  
of the strength and performance characteristics of plywood.  
In the first phase of OSB manufacture, logs are debarked and cut to  
a uniform length. The logs are then turned into strands or wafers.  
The strands are dried with heat in a large rotating drum, which is  
screened to grade for strands that are the correct size. The dried  
strands are sprayed with liquid or powder resin and then trans-  
ported in layers on a conveyer system to a forming line, where the  
layers are cross-oriented into mats. For face layers, the strands  
generally run along the panel; for core layers, the strands are ran-  
domly oriented or run across the panel. The mats are trimmed to a  
workable size and then moved to a press where the wood strands  
and glue are bonded together under heat and pressure to create a  
structural panel. Finally, the panels are cut to size. Panels can be  
manufactured in many sizes simply by altering the cutting pattern.  
OSB uses the wood resource very efficiently, in part because  
sheathing panels can be made using smaller, younger fast-growing  
tree species such as aspen and Southern yellow pine. Plus, about  
85 to 90 percent of a log can be used to make high-quality struc-  
tural panels, and the remainder—bark, saw trim, and sawdust—  
can be converted into energy, pulp chips, or bark dust.  
OSB is most commonly used for traditional applications such as  
sheathing for roofs and walls, subfloors, and single-layer flooring.  
Its superior performance has allowed OSB to gain popularity in a  
This core type is made by using heat and pressure to bond together  
synthetic resin or binder and wood particles of various sizes.  
Employed in a wide variety of architectural woodwork applications,  
industrial-grade particleboard is especially well suited as a sub-  
strate for high-quality veneers and decorative laminates. When  
used as panels without any surface layers, the product is called  
particleboard; when used with wood veneer on the surface, the  
panels are referred to as particle-core plywood. Particleboard core  
is classified into three densities, dependent on weight per cubic ft.\:  
• Low-density\: less than 40 lb. per cubic ft.  
• Medium-density\: 40 to 50 lb. per cubic ft.  
• High-density\: more than 50 lb. per cubic ft.  
Two common panel grades for OSB are APA Rated Sheathing and  
APA Rated Sturd-I-Floor. OSB APA Rated Sheathing is intended for  
subflooring, wall sheathing, and roof sheathing. APA Rated  
Sheathing/Ceiling Deck can also be made using OSB; it is made so  
that one surface has an overlay, texturing, or grooving. Common  
thicknesses for sheathing panels are\: 5/16, 3/8, 7/16, 15/32, 1/2,  
19/32, 5/8, 23/32, and 3/4 in.  
OSB APA Rated Sturd-I-Floor is intended for single-layer flooring  
under carpet and pad. APA Rated Sturd-I-Floor panels often have  
tongue-and-groove edges. Common thicknesses for flooring panels  
are\: 19/32, 5/8, 23/32, 3/4, 7/8, 1, and 1–1/8 in.  
Some medium-density industrial particleboard is bonded with res-  
ins more resistant to swelling when exposed to moisture. The most  
common grades are Type M-2-Exterior Glue and M-3-Exterior Glue  
in accordance with ANSI 208.1.  
Medium-density industrial particleboard may be treated during  
manufacture to carry a UL Class A fire rating stamp \(flame spread,  
20; smoke developed, 25\). This material can be used as a substrate  
for paneling, requiring a Class A rating.  
APA Performance–Rated OSB panels have a designated bond clas-  
sification, which identifies the panel’s resistance to moisture  
exposure. Panels are classified into the following two groups\:  
Exterior panels have a fully waterproof bond and are designed for  
applications subject to permanent exposure to the weather or to  
moisture.  
Exposure 1 panels have a fully waterproof bond and are designed  
for applications where long construction delays may be expected  
prior to providing protection. Approximately 95 percent of  
Performance Rated Panels are manufactured with this designation.  
MDF is made from wood particles reduced to fibers in a moderate-  
pressure steam vessel, combined with resin, and bonded together  
under heat and pressure. The surface is flat, smooth, uniform,  
dense, and free of knots or grain pattern. MDF is useful as a sub-  
strate for paint, thin overlay materials, veneers, and decorative  
laminates. The homogeneous edge allows machining and paint  
8.38 Applicable to APA Rated Panel Sheathing.  
All panels will support at least 30 psf live load plus 10 psf dead load at  
maximum span. Uniform load deflection limit is 1/180 span under live  
load plus dead load, or 1/240 under live load only.  
Special conditions may require construction in excess of the given  
minimums.  
Panel is assumed to be continuous across two or more spans, with long  
dimension across supports.

finishes. MDF is one of the most stable mat-formed panel products  
and is widely used as an architectural panel.  
Some MDF is bonded with a moisture-resistant resin to produce a  
water-resistant product.  
This panel product is made up of alternating layers of thin veneer.  
Adhesive is placed between the layers, and the panels are pressed  
until the adhesive is set; heat is often used to speed the cure. The  
two outside layers, often selected for species, grain, and appear-  
ance, are called the face veneers.  
Hardboard is made of interfelted fibers consolidated under heat  
and pressure to a density of 31 lb. per cubic ft. or more. Available  
with either one side \(S1S\) or two sides \(S2S\) smooth, hardboard  
is often used for casework backs, drawer bottoms, and divider  
panels. Architectural woodworkers typically use two types of  
hardboard core\: standard \(untempered\) and tempered, which is  
standard hardboard that has been subjected to a curing treatment  
to increase its stiffness, hardness, and weight.  
Characteristics of core material performance are influenced by the  
grade and thickness of the core and specific gravity of the core  
species. Visual Edge Quality is rated before treatment with edge  
bands or fillers and, for lumber core, assumes the use of “clear  
edge” grade. Surface uniformity is directly related to the perfor-  
mance of fine veneers placed over the surface. Dimensional stabil-  
ity is usually related to exposure to wide variations in relative  
humidity. Screw-holding and bending strength are influenced by  
proper design and engineering.

The term “plywood” is defined as a panel consisting of three or  
more layers \(plies\) of wood or wood products \(veneers or overlays  
and/or core materials\) generally laminated into a single sheet  
\(panel\). Plywood is separated into two groups, according to materi-  
als and manufacturing\:  
• Hardwood plywood panels are made from hardwood or decora-  
tive softwood veneers over a core material such as medium-  
density particleboard, medium-density fiberboard, low-density  
lumber and other veneers.  
• Softwood plywood panels are made with softwood face veneers,  
and are seldom incorporated into finished architectural wood-  
working projects because of the instability of the core material  
and core voids.  
Wood product substrates are classified in two main facing mate-  
rial categories\: decorative laminates/overlays and wood veneers.

This finish surface category can be broken down into the following  
broad groups\:  
High-pressure decorative laminates are formed under heat and  
pressure from resin-impregnated kraft paper substrates with  
decorative plastic face materials and a clear protective top sheet.  
This assembly, commonly called plastic laminate, offers resistance  
to wear and many stains and chemicals. Common uses include  
casework exteriors, countertops, and wall paneling.

Particleboard  
Excellent Fair Good Fair Refer to Architectural Woodwork Quality Standards Illustrated for additional information.  
Thermally fused decorative panels are flat-pressed from a thermo-  
set polyester or melamine resin-impregnated web, and most have  
been laminated to industrial particleboard or medium-density  
fiberboard substrates when they arrive at the woodwork fabrica-  
tor. Performance is similar to that of high-pressure decorative  
laminates. Common uses include casework interiors, furniture,  
shelving, display materials, and decorative paneling.  
Thermoplastic sheets are semi-rigid sheets or rolls, stock-extruded  
from a nonporous acrylic/polyvinyl chloride \(PVC\) alloy. The materi-  
als are impact resistant and minor scratches and gouges are less  
conspicuous due to the through-color property.  
Medium-density overlays are made from pressed resin-impregnated  
paper overlays, and are highly resistant to moisture. They are  
available applied to cores suitable for both interior and exterior  
uses. The seamless panel face and uniform density offer a sound  
base for opaque finishes and paint.  
Vinyl films, foils, and low-basis weight papers are decorative facing  
materials that, although they have limited use in custom architec-  
tural woodworking, are suitable for some installations.  
Wood veneers are produced in a variety of industry standard thick-  
nesses. The slicing process is controlled by a number of variables,  
but the thickness of the veneer has little bearing on the quality of  
the end product.  
There are two types of veneers, hardwood and softwood. Hardwood  
veneers are available in many domestic and imported wood spe-  
cies and are normally plain-sliced, but certain species can be rift-  
sliced, quarter-sliced, or rotary-cut. Softwood veneers are usually  
sliced from Douglas fir, but pine and other softwoods are available.  
Most softwood veneer is rotary cut. Plain-sliced and quarter-sliced  
\(vertical grain\) softwoods may be obtained by special order.

Most veneers are taken from large trees, but some are sliced from  
fast-growing trees, dyed, and re-glued in molds to create “grain”  
patterns. The color of these reconstituted veneers is established  
during manufacture because the high percentage of glue line  
resists staining.  
The manner in which a log segment is cut with relation to the  
annual rings of the tree determines the appearance of the veneer.  
Individual pieces of veneer, referred to as “leaves,” are kept in the  
order in which they were sliced for reference during installation.  
The group of leaves from one slicing is called a “flitch” and is  
identified by a number and the gross square feet it contains. The  
faces of the leaves with relation to their position in the log are  
identified as the “tight face” \(toward the outside of the log\) and  
the “loose face” \(toward the inside, or heart, of the log\).  
It is possible to achieve certain visual effects by the manner in  
which the veneer leaves are arranged. Rotary-cut veneers are dif-  
ficult to match, therefore most matching is done with sliced  
veneers. Matching of adjacent veneer leaves must be specified.  
Consult the AWI woodworker for choices.  
Book matching is the most commonly used match in the industry.  
In it, every other piece of veneer is reversed so adjacent pieces  
\(leaves\) are “opened” like the pages of a book. Because the  
“tight” and “loose” faces alternate in adjacent leaves, they reflect  
light and accept stain differently. The veneer joints match, creating  
a symmetrical pattern that yields maximum continuity of grain.  
• To achieve balanced construction, panel products should be  
absolutely symmetrical from the centerline. Materials used on  
either side should contract and expand or exhibit moisture per-  
meability at the same rate.  
• In panel construction, the thinner the facing material, the less  
force it can generate to cause warping. The thicker the sub-  
strate, the more it can resist a warping movement or force.  
• Wood veneer standards\: For hardwood plywood, the face  
veneer characteristics of the Hardwood Plywood and Veneer  
Association \(HPVA\) have generally been adapted for use. These  
face grades apply to custom architectural woodwork.  
Rift-cut veneers are produced most often in red and white oak,  
rarely in other species. Note that rift veneers and rift-sawn solid  
lumber are produced so differently that a “match” between them  
is highly unlikely. In both cases the cutting is done slightly off the  
radius lines, minimizing the “fleck” \(sometimes called flake\) asso-  
ciated with quarter-slicing.  
In this match method, adjoining leaves are placed \(slipped out\) in  
sequence without being turned, thus all the same face sides are  
exposed. The grain figure repeats but joints do not show grain  
match.  
In random matching, veneer leaves are placed next to each other  
in a random order and orientation, producing a casual board-by-  
board effect in many species. Conscious effort is made to mis-  
match the grain at joints.  
The plain or flat slicing method is most often used to produce  
veneers for high-quality architectural woodwork. Slicing is done  
parallel to a line through the center of the log. A combination of  
cathedral and straight-grain patterns results, with a natural pro-  
gression of pattern from leaf to leaf.  
To create rotary-cut veneers, the log is center-mounted on a lathe  
and “peeled” along the path of the growth rings, like unwinding a  
roll of paper. This provides a bold, random appearance. Rotary  
veneers vary in width, so matching at veneer joints is extremely  
difficult. Most softwood veneers are cut this way. Rotary-cut  
veneers are the least useful in fine architectural woodwork.  
End matching is often used to extend the apparent length of avail-  
able veneers for high wall panels and long conference tables. End  
matching occurs in two types\:  
• Architectural end match \: Leaves are individually book or slip  
matched, alternating end to end and side to side. Architectural  
end matching yields the best continuous grain patterns for  
length as well as width.  
• Panel end match \: Leaves are book or slip matched on panel  
subassemblies, with sequenced subassemblies end matched,  
resulting in some modest cost savings on projects, where appli-  
cable. For most species, panel end matching yields a pleasing,  
blended appearance and grain continuity.  
Using this method, each panel face is assembled from as many  
veneer leaves as necessary. This often results in an asymmetrical  
appearance, with some veneer leaves of unequal width.  
In balance matching, each panel face is assembled from an odd or  
even number of veneer leaves of uniform width before edge  
trimming.  
Quarter-slicing, roughly parallel to a radius line through the log  
segment, simulates the quarter-sawing process used with solid  
lumber. In many species, the individual leaves are narrow as a  
result. A series of stripes is produced, varying in density and thick-  
ness among species. In red and white oak, “fleck” \(sometimes  
called flake\) is a characteristic of this slicing method.  
Using this method, each panel face is assembled from an even  
number of veneer leaves of uniform width before edge trimming.  
Thus, there is a veneer joint in the center of the panel, producing  
horizontal symmetry.

Adhesives have been used for bonding wood for centuries, but until  
the 1930s they were limited to only a few naturally derived sub-  
stances—those based on animal or vegetable proteins, gums, or  
resins. It wasn’t until World War II that stepped-up materials  
research efforts spurred the development of synthetic adhesives  
for bonding metals, concrete, glass, rubber, plastics, and wood.  
Many of these synthetic adhesives are used to manufacture prod-  
ucts such as plywood, oriented strand board, and laminated tim-  
bers. They can also be used during construction to attach plywood  
subfloors to floor joists, adhere ceramic tiles to floors or walls,  
attach gypsum board, and other construction products. In addition  
to their structural use, adhesives also can be used to eliminate  
squeaks in floors and for some mechanical fastening.  
Adhesives are composed of a base component, dispersion medium,  
and various additives that impart specific properties. The elasto-  
meric base of a construction-type adhesive accounts for 30 to 50  
percent of its weight. Depending on its intended application, this  
base is made of natural rubber \(isoprene\) or synthetic rubbers  
such as neoprene, butyl, polyurethane, polysulfide, nitrile, styrene-  
butadiene, or butadiene acrylonitrile. Additives include tackifiers,  
flow and extrusion modifiers, curing agents, antioxidants, and fill-  
ers. Together, the base and the additives are dispersed \(or dis-  
solved\) in a liquid, typically an organic solvent or water.  
Currently, most adhesives use organic solvents, but water-based  
adhesives are gaining in popularity because they do not emit  
harmful vapors, are easy to clean up, and can be discarded as  
regular trash. The design professional should consider require-  
ments for disposal of the containers containing organic solvents.  
Many jurisdictions are enacting clean air statutes that, among  
other things, target organic solvents as air pollutants. Organic  
solvents also can have adverse effects on the workers who apply  
them, as well as on future building occupants. One drawback to  
most water-based adhesives, however, is that they tend only to  
resist water, whereas the solvent-based adhesives are waterproof.  
Construction adhesives are defined as elastomer-based extrudable  
mastics, which means that the main adhesive component is elastic  
and will continue to maintain some of its flexibility indefinitely.

Mastics are a type of adhesive with high viscosity, or resistance to  
flow. A construction adhesive is a substance capable of holding  
materials together by surface attachment.  
Adhesives used for building have been formulated to tolerate many  
of the often-adverse conditions that exist at most job sites, such as  
extreme temperatures and temperature fluctuations. They are  
excellent for filling gaps, and thus work on both smooth and  
rough surfaces. The degree of adhesion depends on the surface  
conditions of the materials; ice, dirt, grease, or other contaminants  
will all have a negative effect.  
Many of the characteristics of modern adhesives are described in  
Figure 8.48. Note that most adhere to wood, but performance  
depends on careful consideration of the physical and chemical  
compatibility of glue and wood, processing requirements, mechan-  
ical properties, and durability under design conditions.

Nails are made of many types of metal for diverse uses. When  
selecting nails, follow the recommendations of the manufacturer of  
the material to be fastened, as well as applicable building codes.  
General guidelines include\:  
• Select nails so as to avoid galvanic action between the nail and  
the nailed material.  
• Select nail head size according to the strength and area of the  
material to be held.  
• In wood framing use the correct size and number of nails to  
withstand stress. Procedures for calculating nailed connections  
can be found in the National Design Specifications for Wood  
Construction .  
• Base nail selection on the type\(s\) of wood or other materials to  
be assembled, joined, or connected.  
• Be aware that nails with serrated or helically threaded shanks  
have increased holding power, but such nails are difficult to  
remove without destroying the surrounding material.  
• Where nails are exposed to moisture or weather—for example,  
in exterior stucco lath—use nonferrous \(aluminum\) or zinc-  
coated nails.  
• Choose nails for automatic nailing equipment specifically for the  
equipment used. See ANSI’s “Safety Requirements for Power-  
Actuated Fastening Systems,” and OSHA regulations.

# GLASS COMMON CHARACTERISTICS, STANDARDS, AND PRACTICES  
# COMMON CHARACTERISTICS, STANDARDS, AND PRACTICES  
Glass is a hard, brittle, amorphous substance made by melting  
silica \(sometimes combined with oxides of boron or phosphorus\)  
with certain basic oxides \(notably sodium, potassium, calcium,  
magnesium, and lead\) to produce annealed flat glass by a con-  
trolled cooling process. Most glasses soften at 932°F to 2012°F  
\(500°C to 1100°C\). The brittleness of glass is such that minute  
surface scratches in manufacturing greatly reduce its strength.  
• Plate glass\: Transparent flat glass is ground and polished after  
rolling to make plate glass. Cylindrical and conical shapes can be  
bent to a desired curvature \(within limits\). Only glass for spe-  
cialty applications is produced by this method; it is not produced  
for widespread use in architectural applications.  
fabrication. Unlike tempered glass, it breaks into large, sharp  
shards similar to broken annealed glass. Heat-strengthened glass  
is not acceptable for safety glazing applications.  
A number of industry-quality standards apply to glass products\:  
• Glazing Association of North America \(GANA\) Glazing Manual  
• ASTM Standard C1036, “Specification for Flat Glass”  
• ASTM Standard C1048, “Specification for Heat-Treated Flat  
Glass—Kind HS, Kind FT Coated and Uncoated”  
• UL Standard 752, “Bullet-Resisting Equipment”  
• UL Standard 752, “Bullet-Resisting Glazing Material”  
• AAMA Curtain Wall and Storefront Publications\: Glass and  
Glazing  
• ASTM Standard E1300, “Practice for Determining Load  
Resistance of Glass in Buildings”  
• CPSC Standard 16CFR 1201, “Safety Standard for Architectural  
Glazing Materials”  
• ANSI Z97.1\: Safety Glazing Materials Used in Buildings—Safety  
Performance Specification and Methods of Test  
• ASTM C1172, “Specification for Laminated Architectural Flat  
Glass”  
More information can also be found in these two books\: Glass in  
Building , by David Button and Brian Pye \(Pilkington, with Butterworth  
Architecture, 1993\); and Glass in Architecture , by Michael  
Wiggington \(Phaidon Press Ltd., 1996\). Also, be sure to consult  
glass manufacturers for current information because processes,  
qualities, finishes, colors, sizes, thicknesses, and limitations are  
continually revised. The information presented here represents one  
or more manufacturers’ guidelines.  
Several variations of the basic glass types are in use today.  
• Patterned glass\: Patterned glass is known also as rolled or fig-  
ured glass . It is made by passing molten glass through rollers  
that are etched to produce the design. Designs include flutes,  
ribs, grids, and other regular and random patterns, which pro-  
vide translucency and a degree of obscurity. Usually, only one  
side of the glass is imprinted with a pattern. Patterned glass is  
available in thicknesses of 1/8, 3/16, and 7/32 in.  
• Wire glass\: Wire glass is available as clear polished glass or in  
various patterns such as square-welded mesh, diamond-welded  
mesh, and linear parallel wires. Some distortion, wire discolor-  
ation, and misalignment are inherent. Some 1/4-in. wired glass  
products are recognized as certified safety glazing materials for  
use in hazardous locations \(e.g., fire-rated windows, doors, and  
skylights\). For applicable fire and safety codes that govern their  
use, refer to ANSI Z97.1. Note that wire glass is no longer  
exempt from regulations for locations requiring safety glass  
\(i.e., doors and sidelights\). Therefore, it is better to avoid wire  
glass entirely. Consider using other laminated and specialty fire-  
rated and safety-rated products. If wire glass must be used,  
ensure that the submitted product complies with the indicated  
requirement for special wire glass that does comply with safety  
regulations. Verify application of patterned wire glass to avoid  
applications requiring safety glazing.  
• Obscure glass\: Obscure glass is used to obscure a view or cre-  
ate a design. The entire surface on one or both sides of the glass  
can be sandblasted, acid-etched, or both. When a glass surface  
is altered by any of these methods, the glass is weakened, and  
may be difficult to clean.  
Tempered glass is generally four to five times stronger than  
annealed glass. It breaks into innumerable small, cube-shaped frag-  
ments. It cannot be cut, drilled, or altered after fabrication; the  
precise size required and any special features \(such as notches,  
holes, edge treatments, and so on\) must be specified when ordering.  
Tempered glass can be used as a safety glazing material provided it  
complies with the ANSI and CPSC references listed in the “Laminated  
Glass” section, below. Tempered glass can be used in insulating and  
laminated assemblies and in wired, patterned, and coated process-  
es. All float and sheet glass 1/8 in. or thicker may be tempered.  
The high clarity and high visible light transmittance that character-  
ize ultraclear glass come from the special soda lime mixture it is  
made from, which minimizes the iron content that normally gives a  
slight greenish color to clear flat glass. Ultraclear glass is gener-  
ally available in thicknesses from 1/8 to 3/4 in. It can be heat-  
strengthened, tempered, sandblasted, etched, or assembled into  
laminated glass. Ultraclear glass is used for commercial display  
cases, museum cases, display windows, frit-coated spandrel glass,  
aquariums, mirrors, shelving, security glass, and other uses in  
which clarity and better color transmittance are required.

The following are basic types of clear glass\:  
• Sheet glass\: Sheet glass is manufactured by a horizontal flat or  
vertical draw process, and then annealed slowly to produce a  
natural flat-fired, high-gloss surface. It generally is used in  
residential and industrial applications. Because it is not mechan-  
ically polished, inherent surface waves are noticeable in sizes  
larger than 4 sq. ft. For minimum distortion, larger sizes are  
installed with the wave running horizontally. The width is listed  
first when specifying. For architectural applications, sheet glass  
is either single-strength \(0.101 in. thick\) or double-strength  
\(0.134 in. thick\). Very little glass is produced in the United States  
by this process; almost all sheet glass is produced by the float  
process.  
• Float glass\: Generally accepted as the successor to polished  
plate glass, float glass has become the quality standard of the  
glass industry. It is manufactured by floating molten glass on a  
surface of molten tin, then annealing it slowly to produce a  
transparent flat glass, thus eliminating grinding and polishing.  
This process produces a glass with very uniform thickness and  
flatness, making it suitable for applications requiring excellent  
optical properties, such as architectural windows, mirrors, and  
specialty applications. It is available in thicknesses ranging from  
1/8 to 7/8 in. Float glass is made to the specification require-  
ments of ASTM C1036, and its minimum thickness to resist wind  
load is established using ASTM E1300.  
Glass can be strengthened either by a controlled heating and cooling  
process, or by immersion in a chemical bath. Both processes have  
glass thickness, size, and use restrictions that should be verified.  
This type of float glass was developed to help control solar heat  
and glare in large areas of glass. It is available in blue, bronze,  
gray, or green, and in thicknesses ranging from 1/8 to 1/2 in. The  
glass absorbs a portion of the sun’s energy because of its admix-  
ture contents and thickness; it then dissipates the heat to both the  
exterior and interior. The exterior glass surface rejects some heat,  
depending on the sun’s position. Heat-absorbing glass has a higher  
temperature than clear glass when exposed to the sun; thus, the  
central area expands more than the cooler, shaded edges, causing  
edge tensile stress buildup. When designing heat-absorbing or  
tinted glass windows, consider the following\:  
• To minimize shading problems and tensile stress buildup at the  
edges, provide conditions in which glass edges warm as rapidly  
as the exposed glass.  
• The thicker the glass, the greater the solar energy absorption.  
• Indoor shading devices such as blinds and draperies reflect  
energy back through the glass, thus increasing the temperature  
of the glass. Spaces between indoor shading devices and the  
glass, including ceiling pockets, should be vented adequately.  
Heating elements always should be located on the interior side  
of shading devices, directing warm air away from the glass.  
• The glass can be heat-treated to increase its strength and resis-  
tance to edge tensile stress buildup.  
Heat-strengthened \(Kind HS\) and tempered \(Kind FT\) glass are  
produced by reheating annealed float glass close to its softening  
point and then rapidly quenching \(cooling\) it with high-velocity  
blasts of air. Both types have greatly increased mechanical  
strength and resistance to thermal stresses. Before it is heat-  
treated, the glass must be fabricated to its exact size and shape  
\(including any holes\), because neither type of glass can be altered  
after heat treatment.  
Most manufacturers heat-treat the glass using a horizontal pro-  
cess that can introduce warpage, kinks, and bowing into the fin-  
ished product, which may create aesthetic or technical concerns. A  
vertical process may still be available that produces tong marks or  
depressions into the glass surface near the suspended edge.  
Vertical processing may produce large amounts of warping and  
distortion. The heat treatment quenching pattern on the surface of  
the glass can become visible as a pattern of light and dark areas  
at certain oblique viewing angles and with polarized light. This  
effect can be more pronounced with thicker glass and may be an  
aesthetic consideration. Refer to ASTM C1048 for allowable toler-  
ances and other properties.  
Heat-strengthened glass is generally two to three times stronger  
than annealed glass. It cannot be cut, drilled, or altered after  
Insulated glass is constructed from two or more panes of glass  
separated by spacer bars to form a hermetically sealed void  
between the panes. This arrangement greatly enhances the insu-  
lating, thermal, and acoustic properties of the glass unit. The most  
common insulated units are filled with air, and employ a hollow  
spacer bar containing a desiccant to absorb moisture vapor inside  
the unit. The void can be filled with an inert gas such as argon, and  
the spacer can be changed to a “warm edge” type to further  
improve the insulating value of the unit. The spacer bar is sealed to  
the glass with a continuous joint sealant \(typically, butyl or silicone\)  
forming an airtight seal. Structural joint sealant, usually silicone or

polyurethane, is applied outboard of the spacer bar to hold the  
panes of glass together, especially during transport and handling.  
For coastal environments, in structural silicone glazing systems  
and when otherwise recommended by the manufacturer, the archi-  
tect may limit both sealants to the silicone type. By varying the  
makeup of the individual panes of glass in the insulating unit, its  
insulating, shading, and visual characteristics can be greatly  
enhanced.  
Durability for insulating glass is established through ASTM E 774,  
“Standard Specification for the Durability of Sealed Insulated  
Glass Units,” for Class C, CB, or CBA. Class CBA is the most durable  
and is typically selected for most commercial and institutional  
work.  
Laminated, insulating, laminated insulating, and double-laminated  
insulating glass products commonly are used for sound control.  
STC ratings from 31 to 51 are available, depending on glass thick-  
nesses, airspace size, polyvinyl butyral film thickness, and the  
number of laminated units used in insulating products.  
Spandrel glass is an opaque glass and available tinted or with a  
variety of coatings, including reflective, ceramic frit \(patterned and  
solid colors\), and direct-to-glass polyvinylidene fluoride \(PVDF\)  
coatings. It can be heat-treated or laminated, and is available as  
insulating glass units. Insulation and vapor retarders can be added  
to spandrel glass. Consult with spandrel glass manufacturers for  
guidelines.  
Security glass is composed of multiple layers of glass and/or  
polycarbonate plastic that are laminated together under heat and  
pressure with a polyvinyl butyral \(for glass\) or polyurethane plastic  
\(for polycarbonate\) film. It is available in multilayer laminated  
glass, insulating, laminated insulating, and double-laminated insu-  
lating or spaced configurations, generally in thicknesses from 3/8  
in. to 2–1/2 in. as a laminated product and up to about 4–3/4 in.  
for insulating and spaced construction products. Bullet-resistant  
glass should be tested to UL 752, and burglar-resistant to UL 972.  
Consult manufacturers for blast-resistant glass. Security glass  
products, depending on type, are subject to size limitations, and  
some are not recommended for exterior applications. Consult with  
the manufacturer for glazing requirements and restrictions on use.  
Clear, tinted, ceramic frit-coated spandrel, pyrolitically coated, pat-  
terned, laminated, and wire glass are among glass types that can  
be bent in thicknesses to about 1 in. and to a minimum radius of  
about 4 in. Sharp angle bends to 90°, edgework, pattern cutting,  
and tempering \(meeting safety glazing standards\), and heat-  
strengthening are also available. Bent glass can be fabricated into  
insulating glass units. Bent glass tolerances must be compatible  
with the glazing system. Size, configuration, and product availabil-  
ity vary by fabricator.  
Structural glass facades are as much about the expression of ele-  
gant and minimalist structural systems as they are about facade  
transparency. The use of tensile elements in the form of steel  
cables and rods is a primary design strategy to dematerialize the  
structure and enhance the transparency of a facade design.  
Compression elements are frequently minimized or eliminated, and  
where present are crafted from cast and machined components in  
an elegant expression of exposed structure.  
A reflective or low-emissivity coating can be applied to the surface  
of monolithic glass. Generally, only pyrolitically applied “hard”  
coatings \(which have scratch resistance\) are used on exposed  
glass surfaces. During glass manufacture, pyrolitic coatings are  
sprayed onto the glass before it cools, which integrates them with  
the glass surface. Magnetically sputtered or “soft” coatings can  
also be applied to the glass surface, but they must be protected  
from the elements as part of an insulating or laminated glass  
product. The range of coating types, aesthetic appearances, and  
thermal performance available for pyrolitic coatings is generally  
less than for sputtered coatings.  
Annealed clear or tinted glass is washed and ceramic frit paint \(in  
standard or custom color\) silk-screened on its surface in a stan-  
dard or custom pattern or design \(such as dots, holes, lines, or a  
logo\) and then dried in an oven. The frit-coated glass is then sub-  
jected to very high temperatures in a tempering furnace to fire the  
ceramic frit permanently to the glass surface. As a result, silk-  
screened glass will be either heat-strengthened or tempered after  
firing. Reflective and low-emissivity coatings can also be applied to  
the glass surface. Silk-screened glass can be used monolithically  
or for insulating or laminated glass products.

To produce laminated glass, a tough, clear plastic polyvinyl butyral  
\(PVB\) sheet \(interlayered\), ranging in thickness from 0.03 to 0.09 in.,  
is sandwiched, under heat and pressure, between lights of sheet,  
plate, float, wired, heat-absorbing, tinted, reflective, low-emissivity,  
or heat-treated glass, or combinations of each. When laminated  
glass breaks, the particles tend to adhere to the plastic film.  
Laminated glass is manufactured to the specification requirements  
of ASTM C1172. Laminated safety glass should be manufactured to  
comply with ANSI Z97.1 and CPSC 16CFR 1201.  
There are two types of photovoltaic \(PV\) glass\: crystalline silicon  
\(sandwiched between two lights of glass\) and thin-film amorphous  
silicon \(applied to an interior-facing glass surface\). When these  
arrangements are exposed to sunlight, they generate either DC or  
AC power, which is transferred by concealed wiring to the build-  
ing’s power system. Pressure bar or structural silicone flush-  
glazed curtain walls and skylights, awnings, sunshades, light  
shelves, and roof panels are some of the systems that can incorpo-  
rate PV glass. For curtain walls and skylights, the pressure bar  
type allows easy concealment of the wiring. Shadow patterns from  
the cap on the PV glass surface must be considered in system  
design. Flush-glazed systems have no shadow patterns, but wiring  
concealment is more difficult and the PV module on the glass must  
be kept from reacting with the structural silicone sealant. Both  
types of PV glass are used for opaque curtain-wall spandrel panels  
and can be used for curtain-wall or skylight vision glass if the qual-  
ity of daylighting and visibility is acceptable. Consult PV glass and  
metal-framing system manufacturers to determine availability,  
suitability, and cost for a particular application.  
Properly made decorative glass does not necessarily need addi-  
tional glazing to make it waterproof, but it is valuable for insulating  
purposes and to afford some protection from external damage.  
Frames should be designed with a 3/4-in. ventilated space  
between glass, and should be arranged for the protection glass to  
be installed from the exterior, and the decorative glass from the  
interior. Clear glass or textured glass 3/16 to 1/4 in. thick is most  
successful.  
Exterior decorative glass must be pressed into a deep back bed of  
mastic compound or glazing tape. When outside protection glass is  
used, a watertight seal is not required, and foam tape compressed  
between the glazing bead and glass may suffice.

Machine-made and blown glass from the United States, England,  
France, and Germany are available in most solid colors, as well as  
mixed colors and textures. Uniformity of color will vary from glass  
of different batches. Special colors are derived by “sumping,” or  
kiln firing.  
A twentieth-century development in the art of stained glass intro-  
duced the use of glass dalles, 8 by 12 by 1 in., cast in hundreds of  
different colors. These can be cut to any shape and used in combina-  
tion with an opaque matrix of epoxy resin or reinforced concrete 5/8  
to 1 in. in thickness, to create translucent windows and walls of great  
beauty. Sizes are limited, and an outer protection glass is required.  
Further information is available from the Stained Glass Association  
of America.  
Figure 9.4 shows the potential for condensation on glazing \(at the  
center of the glass\) at various outdoor temperatures and indoor  
relative humidity conditions. Condensation can occur at any point  
on or above the curves. \(Note\: All airspaces are 1/2 in.; all coat-

inner surface of double glazing when the indoor relative humidity  
is 52 percent or higher. It will form at an indoor relative humidity  
of 70 percent or higher if a double-pane window with a low-E coat-  
ing and argon fill is used.

The thermal conductivity of glass is relatively high \(k = 7.5\); and  
for single glazing, most of the thermal resistance is imposed at the  
indoor and outdoor surfaces. Indoors, approximately two-thirds of  
the heat flows by radiation to the room surfaces; only one-third  
flows by convection. This can be materially affected by the use of  
forced airflow from induction units, for example. The inner surface  
coefficient of heat transfer, hi, can be substantially reduced by  
applying a low-emittance metallic film to the glass.  
For glazing with airspaces, the U-value can be reduced to a marked  
degree by the use of low-emittance films. This process imparts a  
variable degree of reflectance to the glass, thereby reducing its  
shading coefficient.  
Manufacturers’ literature should be consulted for more details on  
this important subject. Also consult Chapter 27 of the 1981 ASHRAE  
Handbook of Fundamentals .

Heat gains through sunlit fenestration constitute major sources of  
cooling load in summer. In winter, discomfort is often caused by exces-  
sive amounts of solar radiation entering through south-facing win-  
dows. By contrast, passive solar design depends largely on admission  
and storage of the radiant energy falling on south-facing and horizon-  
tal surfaces. Admission takes place both by transmission through  
glazing and by inward flow of absorbed energy. With or without the  
sun, heat flows through glazing, either inwardly or outwardly, when-  
ever there is a temperature difference between the indoor and out-  
door air. These heat flows may be calculated in the following manner.  
The solar heat gain is estimated by a two-step process. The first  
step is to find, either from tabulated data or by calculation, the rate  
at which solar heat would be admitted under the designated condi-  
tions through a single square foot of double strength \(1/8-in.\) clear  
sheet glass. This quantity, called the solar heat gain factor \(SHGF\),  
is set by \(a\) the local latitude; \(b\) the date, hence the declination;  
\(c\) the time of day \(solar time should be used\); \(d\) the orientation  
of the window. Tabulated values of SHGF are given in the ASHRAE  
Handbook of Fundamentals \(1981\), Chapter 27, for latitudes from  
0° \(the equator\) to 64° N by 8° increments and for orientations  
around the compass from N to NNW, by 22.5° increments. Selected  
values from the 40° table are given in an adjacent column.  
Each individual fenestration system, consisting of glazing and  
shading devices, has a unique capability to admit solar heat. This  
property is evaluated in terms of its shading coefficient \(SC\), which

is the ratio of the amount of solar heat admitted by the system  
under consideration to the solar heat gain factor for the same  
conditions. In equation form, this becomes\:  
Solar heat gain \(Btu/sq. ft. \* hr\) = SC × SHGF  
Values of the shading coefficient also are given in the ASHRAE  
Handbook of Fundamentals \(1981\), Chapter 27, for the most  
widely used glazing materials alone and in combination with inter-  
nal and external shading devices. Selected values for single and  
double glazing are given in Figure 9.6.  
For combinations of glazing and shading devices, also refer to  
Chapter 27 of the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals .  
The heat flow caused by temperature difference is found by multi-  
plying the U-value for the specified fenestration system by the area  
involved and by the applicable temperature difference\:

The same equation is used for both summer and winter, with appro-  
priate U-values, but in winter the conduction heat flow is usually  
outward because the outdoor air is colder than the indoor air.  
As an example, find the total heat gain, in Btu/sq. ft. \* hr, for 1000  
sq. ft. of unshaded 1/4-in. heat-absorbing single glass, facing west,  
in Denver, Colorado \(40°N latitude\) at 4\:00 P.M. solar time on  
October 21. Indoor air temperature is 70°F; outdoor air tempera-  
ture is 40°F.  
From Figure 9.12, for 4\:00 P.M. on October 21, find the SHGF for  
west-facing fenestration on October 21 to be 173 Btu/sq. ft. \* hr.  
For 1/4-in. heat-absorbing glass, SC = 0.69, and U for winter  
conditions is 1.10 Btu/sq. ft. \* hr \* °F.  
Q = 1000 × \[0.69 × 173 + 1.10 × \(40 − 70\)\]  
= 1000 × \(119.4 − 33.0\) = 86,400 Btu/hr  
Even though the outdoor air is 30° cooler than the indoor air, the  
net heat gain through the window in question would be equivalent  
to 7.2 tons of refrigeration.  
For the same window area in summer, on August 21 at 4\:00 P.M.  
solar time, SHGF = 216, and the air temperatures may be taken as  
95°F outdoors and 78°F indoors. The total heat gain will be\:  
Q = 1000 × \[0.69 × 216 + 1.04 × \(95 − 78\)\]  
= 1000 × \(149.0 + 17.7\) = 166,700 Btu/hr  
= 13.9 tons of refrigeration  
The cooling load can be reduced by selecting a fenestration system  
with a lower shading coefficient and U-value. Under the same  
conditions, a double-glazed window with two lights of 1/4-in. clear  
glass and a highly reflective translucent inner shading device  
would have U = 0.52 and SC = 0.37. The cooling load would then  
be reduced to 88,760 Btu/hr, or 7.4 tons of refrigeration.

When the opaque surfaces of a structure are struck by solar  
radiation, much of the energy is absorbed by the irradiated sur-  
face, raising its temperature and increasing the rate of heat flow  
into the roof or wall. The time lag between the onset of irradiation  
and the resulting rise in the indoor surface temperature depends  
on the thickness and mass per unit area of the building element  
and on the thermal conductivity, specific heat, and density of the  
materials. The time lag is negligible for an uninsulated metal roof, but  
it can be a matter of hours for a massive concrete or masonry wall.  
Heat flow through sunlit opaque building elements is estimated by  
using the sol-air temperature, tsa, defined as an imaginary outdoor  
temperature that, in the absence of sunshine, would give the same  
rate of heat flow as actually exists at the specified time under the  
combined influence of the incident solar radiation and the ambient  
air temperature.  
tsa = I × Abs./ho  
12 285 where I = solar irradiance \(Btu/sq. ft. \* hr\)  
Abs. = surface absorptance, dimensionless  
ho = outer surface coefficient \(Btu/sq. ft. \* hr \* °F\)  
Surface absorptances range from as low as 0.30 for a white sur-  
face to 0.95 for a black built-up roof. Values of ho range from the  
conventional 4.0 for summer with an assumed wind speed of 7.5  
mph to a still air value of 3.0.  
For example, find the rate of heat flow through a 1000 sq. ft. unin-  
sulated black built-up roof, U = 0.3, under strong summer sunshine,  
I = 300 Btu/sq. ft. \* hr, still air with 100°F outdoors, 78°F indoors.  
The sol-air temperature is found from\:  
tsa = 300 × \(0.95/3.0\) + 100 = 195°F  
12  
19 253 19 113 The rate of heat flow, neglecting the time lag, is\:  
Q = 1000 × 0.3 × \(195 − 78\) = 35,100 Btu/hr  
With no sunshine on the roof, the heat flow is  
heat flow = 1000 × 0.3 × \(100 − 78\) = 6600 Btu/hr  
The effect of the solar radiation is thus to increase the heat flow  
rate by 88 percent. A more massive roof with a lower U-value would  
show considerably less effect of the incoming solar radiation.  
The National Fenestration Rating Council \(NFRC\) has developed  
a fenestration energy rating system based on whole-product

performance. The system accurately accounts for the energy-related  
effects of all of a product’s component parts and prevents misleading  
comparisons of information about a single component with whole-  
product properties. At this time, NFRC labels on window units give  
ratings for U-value, solar heat gain coefficient, and visible light trans-  
mittance. Soon, labels will include air infiltration rates and an annual  
fenestration heating and cooling rating. The initial development of the  
NFRC rating system has focused on window units manufactured  
mainly for residential applications. In the future, the NFRC will adapt  
the rating system to commercial glazing and curtain wall systems.  
Manufacturers of modern fenestration products want to take  
credit for the technological advances and increasing complexity of  
their products, but these are not easily visually verified. Thus, in  
1989, the NFRC was established to develop a fair, accurate, and  
credible rating system for these products. State energy codes  
began to incorporate NFRC procedures in 1992, and the National  
Energy Policy Act provided for the development of a national rating  
system. The U.S. Department of Energy has certified the NFRC  
procedures as the national rating system, and they are now refer-  
enced in and being incorporated into the Model Energy Code and  
ASHRAE Standards 90.1 and 90.2.  
Note that the total window U-factor takes into account the glass \(edge  
of glass and center of glass\) and the frame in a vertical position.  
Changing the mounting angle can affect the U-factor of a window.  
NFRC ratings are determined for a fixed set of environmental  
conditions and specific product sizes and may not be appropriate  
for directly determining seasonal energy performance.  
absorb more of the other colors. Similarly, bronze-tinted glass will  
absorb the blues and greens and transmit the warmer colors.  
Neutral gray tints absorb most colors equally.  
This same principle applies outside the visible spectrum. Most  
glass is partially transparent to at least some ultraviolet radiation,  
whereas plastics are commonly more opaque to ultraviolet. Glass  
is opaque to far-infrared radiation but generally transparent to  
near-infrared.  
With the recent advances in glazing technology, manufacturers can  
control how glazing materials behave in different areas of the  
spectrum. The basic properties of the substrate material \(glass or  
plastic\) can be altered, and coatings can be added to the surfaces  
of the substrates. For example, a window optimized for daylighting  
and for reducing solar heat gain should transmit adequate light in  
the visible portion of the spectrum but exclude unnecessary heat  
gain from the near-infrared part of the solar spectrum. On the other  
hand, a window optimized for collecting solar heat gain in winter  
should transmit the maximum amount of visible light as well as heat  
from the near-infrared wavelengths in the solar spectrum, while  
blocking the lower-energy radiant heat in the far-infrared range \(an  
important heat-loss component\). These are the strategies of spec-  
trally selective and low-emittance coatings, respectively.  
Three things happen to solar radiation as it passes through a glaz-  
ing material\: some is transmitted, some is reflected, and the rest  
is absorbed. These three components determine many of the other  
energy-performance properties of a glazing material. Manipulating  
the proportion of transmittance, reflectance, and absorptance for  
different wavelengths of solar radiation has been the source of  
much recent innovation in window energy performance. The four  
basic properties of glazing that affect radiant energy transfer are  
transmittance, reflectance, absorptance, and emittance.  
Before the recent innovations in the technology of glass, the pri-  
mary property of glass was its capability to transmit visible light,  
and its quality was judged by how clear it was. However, as atten-  
tion focused on improving the total energy performance of glass, it  
became clear that transparency to visible light is only part of the  
picture.  
Visible light is a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.  
Beyond the blues and purples lie ultraviolet radiation and other  
higher-energy short wavelengths, from X-rays to gamma rays.  
Beyond red light are the near-infrared, given off by very hot  
objects, the far-infrared, given off by warm room-temperature  
objects, and the longer microwaves and radio waves.  
Glazing types vary in their transparency to different parts of the  
spectrum. On the simplest level, a glass that appears to be tinted  
green as you look through it toward the outside will transmit more  
sunlight from the green portion of the visible spectrum and reflect/  
The graphics in Figure 9.10 illustrate the solar heat gain and visi-  
ble light transmittance for common glazing types used in windows  
and curtain walls in commercial buildings. The graphics are for

Important window glazing considerations are as follows\:  
• Dry glazing methods are generally less expensive than wet  
methods.  
• Cap beads make glazing watertight and weathertight and are  
required for face-sealed glazing systems. Cap beads can also be  
used to increase the performance of existing windows.  
• Two-sided structural silicone glazing usually has the other two  
sides either pressure plate–glazed or wet/dry glazed.  
• Heel beads can be added at the bottom edge and turned up 6 to  
8 in. to protect against water leaks caused by differential pres-  
sures between the interior and exterior.  
• Heel beads at the full perimeter may be required to provide a  
continuous air barrier in a pressure-equalized rainscreen curtain-  
wall system.  
• Skylights generally use wet glazing methods, cap beads, or  
structural silicone glazing.

# ELEMENT A\: SUBSTRUCTURE SOILS AND SOILS EXPLORATIONS  
# SOILS AND SOILS EXPLORATIONS  
Bringing together project team design professionals, including  
geotechnical engineers, structural engineers, and architects to  
discuss the matter of soils and foundations is fundamental to  
ensure that the foundation selected satisfies the constraints of the  
project budget as well as the functionality of the structure.  
Understanding the vocabulary of geotechnical science \(for exam-  
ple, the difference between “cohesive” and “cohesionless” soils\)  
is the first step toward fostering collaborative communication,  
which becomes increasingly important as the process continues.  
What should be tested, what the test should be, why it is important,  
and what are the limitations of the test must be addressed.  
Likewise, identifying foundation and ground modification alterna-  
tives \(as well as their pros and cons\) will aid in the preliminary  
design phase, when the building foundations are being developed.  
Understanding the geotechnical investigation report and geo-  
graphical variations such as climate and seismic conditions will  
assist the design professionals in discussing important foundation  
issues.  
It is critical that geotechnical and structural engineering informa-  
tion be understood properly; to that end, the following definitions  
of common soils and other terms are included below for reference\:  
• Clay\: Determined by the size of particles and composition, clays  
are chemically different from their parent materials as a result  
of weathering. Clays are typically inorganic and have grain sizes  
less than 0.0002 in. in diameter. This material contains charged  
particles and has an affinity for water. Because of their size and  
chemical composition, clays exhibit cohesion and plasticity.  
Clays can be classified as stiff, medium, or soft, depending on  
the moisture content, with drier clays typically being stiffer.  
Clays make a satisfactory bearing material under some condi-  
tions. Long-term settlement can sometimes control the allow-  
able bearing pressure. Because of the cohesive nature of clay,  
excavations can have steep slopes for short periods of time.  
• Silt\: Silt consists of inorganic particles between 0.003 in. and  
0.0002 in. in diameter. These fine-grained particles are similar in  
composition to the rocks from which they are derived, and are  
not plastic in nature. Organic silt is found on the bottom of lakes  
and river deltas.  
• Sand\: Classifications of sand vary from fine to coarse; these  
rock particles range in size from 0.003 in. to 0.079 in. in diame-  
ter. Adequately compacted, sand makes an ideal bearing mate-  
rial. The coarser the sand, the higher the allowable bearing  
pressures. Fine sands are susceptible to becoming quick when  
subjected to unbalanced hydrostatic pressures, and may liquefy  
when they are loose, saturated, or subjected to seismic forces.  
Settlement is usually immediate, with little long-term settlement.  
• Gravel\: Classifications of gravel vary from fine to coarse, and  
these unconsolidated rock fragments range from .75 in. to about  
3 in. in size. Except for gravels composed of shale, this material  
makes a good foundation material. Depending on the compact-  
ness and the underlying material, very high bearing pressures  
are allowed by some building codes.  
• Cobbles\: Ranging in size from about 3 in. to about 10 in., these  
rock fragments can make reliable foundation-bearing materials,  
but can be difficult to properly compact, when used for fill.  
Cobble-sized materials can interfere with pile driving and  
drilled-pier construction causing significant problems.  
• Boulders\: Typically classified as rock fragments greater than  
10 in., boulders can be used as part of a fill mass if the voids  
between the boulders are filled with finer-grained sands and  
silts. These materials are generally not considered suitable for  
direct foundation support because of their size and shape, and  
the difficulty in excavating the material to desired shapes. As  
with cobbles, boulders can cause significant problems during  
construction.  
• Bedrock\: Unbroken hard rock that is not over any other material  
is considered bedrock. Depending upon its composition, it can  
be capable of withstanding extremely high bearing pressure,  
and is desirable for foundations supporting high loads. If the  
rock has been weathered or is cracked, its bearing capacity may  
be compromised. Settlement of buildings on bedrock is primarily  
limited to the elastic settlement of the foundation.  
• Residuum\: Residuum consists of soil derived from the in-place  
decomposition of bedrock materials. In general, these soils are  
more weathered near the surface, and gradually transition to a  
more rocklike material with depth. Where residual soils reveal  
evidence of the stratification and structure of the parent rock,  
they are known as saprolitic materials.  
• Alluvial soils\: As materials are eroded, transported, and depos-  
ited through the action of flowing water, these soils are typically  
loose and saturated, hence often are unsuitable for support of  
structures or pavements.  
• Colluvial soils\: As materials are transported by gravity, typically  
associated with landslides, these soils are generally irregular in  
composition and loose. They require improvement prior to being  
used to support buildings and pavements.  
• Aeolian soils \: These soils are transported and deposited by the  
wind. Typically, they consist of silt or sand-sized soils. Loess, one  
of the more common types of aeolian soils, is comprised of fine  
cemented silt. While this material may be competent in-place, it  
loses much of its strength when disturbed or recompacted.  
• Till\: Till is a mixture of clay, silt, sand, gravel, and boulders  
deposited by glaciers. Consolidated tills that are well graded  
\(indicated by a uniform distribution of particle size\) are excep-  
tionally strong and make excellent foundation strata. Loose  
tills can cause differential settlements if used as a bearing  
material.  
• Loam\: This organic material, made up of humus and sand, silt, or  
clay, provides excellent material for agriculture, but should not  
be used for foundations. Organic materials will settle a great  
deal over time, and even lightly loaded slabs on grade will settle  
if bearing on loam.  
• Cohesionless soils\: These types of soils consist of cobbles,  
gravels, sands, and nonplastic silts. They are generally formed  
from the mechanical weathering of bedrock brought about by  
water, ice, heat, and cold. They are typically composed of the  
same minerals as the parent rock. The strength of cohesionless  
materials is derived primarily from interparticle friction.  
• Cohesive soils\: These types of soils contain clay minerals with  
an unbalanced chemical charge. As a result, they tend to attract  
water and bond together. The strength of cohesive materials is  
derived from a combination of these chemical bonds and from  
interparticle friction.  
• Consolidation\: When soils are subjected to loads, water within  
the void spaces initially supports the change in stress through  
an increase in pressure. Excess pressures gradually dissipate in  
proportion to the permeability of the soil. Coarse-grained mate-  
rials drain rapidly, while finer-grained silts and clays drain more  
slowly. As the excess pore pressures dissipate, the void spaces  
compress and transfer the loads to the soil grains. The resulting  
reduction in volume over time is known as consolidation .  
• Underconsolidated soils\: Soils that have built up in river deltas  
and other water bodies are deposited in a very loose state.  
These soils are often underconsolidated, in that they have never  
experienced stresses equal to or greater than current overbur-  
den stresses. These materials tend to consolidate under their  
own weight over time, until all excess pore pressures have been  
dissipated and the soils become “normally consolidated.”  
Foundations bearing on underconsolidated soils can typically  
expect large short- and long-term settlement.  
• Overconsolidated soils\: Unlike many other types of materials,  
soils are not elastic. When stresses are applied to soils, they  
compress. However, when the same stress is removed, they do  
not rebound to the same height. When reloaded, the soils  
“remember” previously loaded conditions and compress to their  
historical level of stress. Soils that have previously been loaded  
to stresses above those created by the current soil overburden  
are considered to be overconsolidated. Foundations bearing on  
overconsolidated soils can typically expect less short- and long-  
term settlements.  
• Desiccation\: All soils typically contain some moisture within the  
voids between soil particles. When soils are dried, capillary ten-  
sion tends to pull the soil grains together, causing the soil to  
shrink and lose volume. This action can cause the soil to become  
overconsolidated, as the capillary tension results in stress.  
The Unified Soil Classification system, as defined in ASTM D2487, is  
the classification system most commonly used by geotechnical engi-  
neers as a basis for defining the soils found in their tests. This sys-  
tem allows for reproducible and reliable understanding of soils found  
from the testing performed at the site. Because some of the testing  
is qualitative, it also provides a mechanism to correlate the soils.  
For a structure to perform properly, it is essential that it bear on a  
suitable foundation tailored to the specific subsurface conditions  
within the project site. While geologic conditions can be generally  
consistent within broad areas of the country, subsurface conditions  
can vary considerably within short horizontal distances caused by  
both natural and human-made factors. Consequently, geotechnical  
investigation must be performed for each new development to  
characterize site-specific conditions and to evaluate cost-effective  
and practical site preparation and foundation recommendations.  
Two types of geotechnical investigations are often conducted. In a  
preliminary study , several sites may be considered for construction,  
and only a broad understanding of conditions may be required  
to find the parcel with the least cost of development. In a final,

subsidence, expansive soils? \(2\) Are landslides prevalent? \(3\) Will  
soils in the area liquefy or rupture during a seismic event?  
• Historical issues\: \(1\) Was the site developed in the past? \(2\) Is  
existing fill present? \(3\) Was mining conducted within or  
beneath the site?  
• Excavation issues\: \(1\) What types of materials will need to be  
excavated as part of development? \(2\) Can excavations be sloped,  
or will they require shoring? \(3\) Will groundwater be encountered  
in excavations, and how may it be dealt with? \(4\) Can excavated  
materials be reused for fill? \(5\) What is the depth and type of  
topsoil, and can it be stripped, stockpiled, and reused?  
• Applicable foundations\: \(1\) Is the site compatible with shallow  
foundations, or can subsurface conditions be improved to sup-  
port shallow foundations? \(2\) What types of deep foundations  
are most cost-effective? \(3\) What parameters should be used in  
the design of foundations? \(4\) What factors should be considered  
in foundation construction, given the nature of subsurface condi-  
tions? \(5\) What is the expected performance of the foundation?  
• Seismic issues\: \(1\) Is the site near a fault? \(2\) How will the site  
react to a seismic event? \(3\) What seismic building code param-  
eters are applicable to the site? \(4\) Are there any local regula-  
tory restrictions on construction?  
Subsurface studies employ a broad array of investigative tech-  
niques that are often specific to an area of the country. Certainly,  
specific needs should be delineated by the project design team, but  
broad latitude should be given to the geotechnical engineer to  
define the scope of study required to properly assess subsurface  
conditions and to develop design recommendations for site prepa-  
ration and substructures.

# ELEMENT A\: SUBSTRUCTURE SOILS AND SOILS EXPLORATIONS  
A geotechnical report helps the design team understand the site on  
which the structure is to be built. Most geotechnical reports con-  
tain the following information, based on the previously defined  
scope of exploration\:  
• Report summary  
• Project information  
• Exploration methods  
• Description of soil and groundwater conditions  
• Design recommendations  
• Construction considerations  
• Location diagram  
• Soil boring or test pit logs  
• Soil profiles  
• Laboratory test results  
The report summary provides the most salient information and  
recommendations of the report. Also included in the report would  
be project information describing the building and site characteris-  
tics such as number of stories, building construction materials,  
foundation loadings, basement data if applicable, and grades. The  
exploration section defines how the geotechnical engineer  
obtained the soil information required to describe the founda-  
tion—this would include number, location, and depth of soil bor-  
ings and test pits, and laboratory and field-testing to be performed.  
The general soil and groundwater conditions include a general  
overview of the results of the geotechnical engineer’s tests. More  
detailed information is contained in the soil boring and test pit  
logs, which can be reviewed when required.  
The design recommendations section makes specific recommenda-  
tions concerning the design of foundations, grade slab, walls,  
drainage requirements, and other key building components. It  
should be read together with the section on construction consider-  
ations, which identifies potential problems during construction that  
can be avoided or minimized.  
Often reports will provide a transverse section of the soil profile,  
combining the soil-boring information in a convenient picture. This  
will enable the reader to better understand approximately how the  
soil properties vary across the site.  
A soil boring log, which is prepared by the geotechnical engineer,  
identifies the layers of soil found at specific depths beneath the  
surface and lists several measured characteristics of this soil,  
which could impact the design of any structure built upon it.

These soils need to be removed, treated, or bypassed through the  
use of deep foundations to prevent damage to structures.  
Expansive soils contain clay minerals derived from volcanic ash and  
marine deposits that attract and readily absorb water. The water  
chemically bonds with the clay mineral and causes the soil to expand.  
It is not unusual for such materials to swell 5 to 10 percent upon  
wetting and to exert pressures of 10,000 psf or more. These soils are  
prevalent in the southwestern and western parts of the United  
States, but are present in limited areas of the South and Midwest.  
when accumulated inside buildings. According to the World Health  
Organization, the decay product of radon can enter into the lungs  
and increase the risk of lung cancer. The EPA established that a  
concentration of 4.0 pCi/L \(picocuries per liter\) constitutes a  
potential hazard and recommends remediation action when 2 to  
4 pCi/L are detected. The agency recommends that every home and  
workplace be tested for amount of radon in the air.  
Radon, which comes from the natural decay of uranium in rocks  
and soil, is a gas which cannot be detected by our senses. It is  
harmless when present in outdoor air but can be a health threat

Cold climates in North America are generally north of the 40th  
parallel. “Very cold” is identified by the southern boundary of the  
32°F mean annual temperature, and includes most of Canada and  
Alaska, except along the Pacific Coast. Permafrost extends from  
below the Hudson Bay and just north of the southern coast of  
Alaska to the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic Circle designates the south-  
ernmost point where continuous daylight in summer and continu-  
ous darkness in winter exists. Foundations in these climates are  
extremely important, and technically challenging to design.  
The danger for foundations in these climates is that the soil around  
and under the foundation might thaw and lose strength. There are  
several strategies for designing in these areas. Both self- contained  
convection \(passive\) and mechanically refrigerated \(active\)  
systems are used for new construction and stabilization of existing  
foundations, either directly as pipe piles or in smaller pipes  
\(probes\) that can be placed beside a pile or under a slab or founda-  
tion. Passive systems rely on natural convection of a liquid or gas  
medium to remove heat from the ground to keep it frozen; active  
systems use pumps and refrigeration technology. Recent concerns  
regarding global warming have caused renewed interest in the  
design parameters for passive systems.  
In the scope of climate issues, the following are important terms\:  
• Permafrost\: Ground of any kind that stays colder than the freez-  
ing temperature of water throughout several years. Depth can  
extend to 2000 ft. below the active layer.  
• Active layer\: Top layer of ground subject to annual freezing and  
thawing. Can be up to 10 ft. or only 18 in. over some permafrost.  
• Frost heaving\: Lifting or heaving of soil surface created by the  
freezing of subsurface frost-susceptible material.  
• Frost-susceptible soil\: Soil that has enough permeability and  
capillary action \(wickability\) to allow ice lenses to form and  
expand upon freezing.  
• Ice lense \(taber ice\)\: Subsurface pocket of ice in soil.  
• Ice wedge\: Wedge-shaped mass of ice within thaw zone.  
Wedges range up to 3 or 4 ft. wide and 10 ft. deep.  
• Pereletok\: Frozen layer at the base of the active layer that  
remains unthawed during some cold summers.  
• Residual thaw zone\: Layer of unfrozen ground between the  
permafrost and active layer. This layer does not exist when  
annual frost extends to the permafrost, but is present during  
some warm winters.

• Condition 1\: Buildings elevated on piles allow the dispersion of  
building heat to prevent ground thaw and allow the wind to  
remove snow. Wooden piles, with low thermal conductivity,  
induce minimal heat into the frozen ground, while thermopiles  
can remove heat to retain frozen state.  
• Condition 2\: Buildings elevated on non-frost-susceptible gravel  
pads provide insulation in addition to existing ground cover. Rigid  
insulation adds to the protection from thaw of the permafrost.  
Thermopiles are used to refreeze fill and keep permafrost frozen.

lifecycle.

Foundations, because they are hidden below the surface, are often  
overlooked and their importance minimized by the design team. A  
great deal of scientifically guided creativity is often necessary to  
produce a foundation that supports the loads of the structure in  
such a way as to economically maintain the aesthetics and function  
of a facility. The wide variety of soil types and conditions across the  
United States—from the bedrock near the surface in New York to  
the sink holes and coral in Florida to the deep soft clays in the  
Midwest and South, and expansive soils in the Southwest to the  
seismically active areas of the country such as the West Coast—  
pose a challenge to the design team. The most popular and eco-  
nomical foundation solution is the spread footing. Spread footings  
are typically shallow, simple to design and construct, and perform  
well under many conditions. When properly designed, load is  
spread from a column to the soil at a bearing pressure that causes  
neither excessive settlement nor failure of the soil.  
Should the soil conditions near the surface be weak, poorly com-  
pacted, filled with debris or organic material, or too compressible,  
deep foundations are warranted. The effect is to extend the foun-  
dation through the weak strata to a soil type that can withstand the  
loadings with tolerable settlement. Deep foundations come in  
several types and, depending on the soil conditions, may include  
driven piles, bored piles \(bored, augered, or drilled\) or caissons.  
Deep foundations resist imposed loads either by end bearing or  
side friction or some combination. It is not necessary to drive or  
drill a deep foundation to rock, only to the depth required to reach  
a suitable stratum.  
A spread footing is not always appropriate, such as when the  
property line limits the extent of the foundation in one direction, or  
when the soil conditions are very weak and suitable soil strata too  
deep to reach with a deep foundation. In these cases, other types  
of special foundations \(such as combined footings, strap footings,  
and raft foundations\) are sometimes required.  
Two basic criteria should be met for all foundations\:  
• Soil strength \(bearing capacity\) \: The ability of a soil to support a  
load without experiencing failure is known as the bearing capac-  
ity and is a function of the foundation size as well as the inherent  
strength properties of the soil. If the pressures exerted by a  
foundation exceed the strength of a soil, the soil mass experi-  
ences a shear failure leading to gross movements of both the  
soil and the supporting foundation element.  
• Limitations of settlement \: Settlement can happen either imme-  
diately \(foundations on sands\), or over a period of time, short  
or long term \(foundations on clays\). Some settlement is  
expected, over various parts of the country; typical and accept-  
able settlement is usually less than 1 in. Settlement is not as  
important with a solitary structure, but becomes more impor-  
tant when\: \(1\) buildings adjacent to an existing structure need  
to be interconnected; \(2\) long utility runs need to be connected  
to the structure; or \(3\) there is sensitive equipment in the build-  
ing. Uniform settlement is somewhat better tolerated than dif-  
ferential settlement that is uneven across several columns.  
Differential settlement distorts the structure and causes crack-  
ing of the exterior skin and interior partitions, broken windows,  
and doors that don’t open. Allowable differential settlement  
may be dependent on the material of the skin and structure; for  
example, brick and concrete masonry buildings tolerate less  
differential settlement than curtain-wall buildings. Differential  
settlement of 1/4 in. is typically considered tolerable for most  
building types.  
The importance of proper foundation design and detailing cannot  
be overemphasized. Working with the geotechnical engineer,  
Often, settlement governs the allowable bearing pressure, which is  
set at an intensity that will yield a settlement within tolerable lev-  
els for the building type. Allowable settlement is typically building  
and use specific. Total and differential settlement, as well as the  
time rate of the occurrence of the settlement, must be considered  
when evaluating whether the settlement is tolerable. For example,  
in the case of a conventional steel frame structure, in typical prac-  
tice a total maximum settlement of 1 in. is usually acceptable, and  
differential settlement of one-half of the total settlement is also  
usually tolerable.  
Settlement tolerance is commonly referred to in terms of angular  
distortion in the building or settlement between columns. Typically,  
an angular distortion of 1\:480 is used for conventional structures.  
This equates to 1 in. in 480 in., or 1 in. in 40 ft. Depending on the  
type of structure, the allowable angular distortion might vary from  
1\:240 for a flexible structure \(such as a wood frame, single-story  
structure\) to 1\:1000 for a more “brittle” or sensitive structure.  
certain point. For instance, in excavating for a large basement,  
the weight of the soil removed will relieve pressure on the  
underlying soil, and the soil will immediately expand vertically  
upward in an elastic manner because of the stress relief. If the  
excavation is filled back in with soil or a building, the underlying  
soil will experience elastic recompression. Normally, the elastic  
heave and recompression are relatively minor, and are usually  
taken into consideration by the geotechnical engineer.  
• Lowering of the water table\: The lowering of a groundwater  
table can have significant settlement consequences if proper  
precautions are not taken. The lowering of the groundwater  
table can occur naturally by drought conditions or vegetation or  
by human activities. If a temporary dewatering system is  
installed in conjunction with a construction project, or if a per-  
manent perimeter drain is constructed around a basement  
below the original groundwater table, then settlement of nearby  
structures can occur. The reason is that the clay soil that was  
previously below the groundwater table and is now above the  
groundwater table after dewatering has lost its buoyancy condi-  
tion. This increases the effective stress and weight on the  
underlying soil. While a rather complicated process, the design  
professional should be aware that any significant lowering of  
the groundwater table could adversely affect adjoining property.  
• Vibration\: This type of special settlement problem occurs when  
granular soils \(primarily sand and gravel\) are subjected to vibra-  
tions. The vibrations can be from machinery installations, traffic,  
pile driving, other construction operations, or seismic events.  
When the vibrations encounter a granular soil deposit that is in  
a less-than-optimum dense condition, the vibration energy  
causes the particles to rearrange themselves. The soil settles  
into a denser condition and settlement results. Clay soils are not  
nearly as susceptible to densification by vibrations as are  
granular soils.  
When load is applied to granular soils, the grains of soil are able  
to respond almost immediately, and they will densify as the packing  
of the grains becomes tighter.  
Clay soils exhibit a time-dependent relationship associated with  
the consolidation of the clay soil. In order for the clay to consoli-  
date, and the overlying soil or structure to settle, the excess pres-  
sures that are induced in the water in the clay must dissipate, and  
this takes time because of the low permeability of the clay.  
Depending on the drainage characteristics of the clay, the time  
required for 90 percent of the consolidation \(and settlement\) to  
occur may vary from a few months to several years. If there is a  
high frequency of sand layers or seams within the clay mass, then  
the consolidation will be quicker, because the excess pore water  
pressure can be dissipated faster.  
Both sand and clay soils have a built-in “memory” that, in effect,  
remember the maximum load that was applied to the soil at some  
time in the past. This memory is referred to as the preconsolidation  
pressure . If 10 ft. of soil has been removed \(by excavation or ero-  
sion\) from a soil profile, then the equivalent weight of that 10 ft. of  
soil \(approximately 1250 lbs per square foot\) could be reapplied to  
the soil profile without the soil below sensing any difference.  
Depending on the process that deposited the soil—weathering  
processes, past climatological changes, or human activities—the  
preconsolidation pressure of the soil may be far in excess of the  
pressures induced by the current soil profile. When that is the case,  
settlement of conventional structures is rarely a significant con-  
cern. But when the soil has not been preconsolidated, the addition  
of any new load may result in excessive settlement.  
Footings lie under the basement, crawl space, or foundation walls,  
and transfer structural loads from the walls of the building to the  
supporting soil. Footings are typically cast-in-place concrete,  
extending beneath the frost depth to prevent damage and heaving  
caused by freezing of water in the soil.  
The bottom surface of the footing should not exceed a slope of 1 in  
10\. The footing should rest on undisturbed native soil, unless this  
soil is unsuitable, in which case, the unsuitable soil should be  
removed and replaced with compacted fill material. Similarly, tree  
roots, construction debris, and ice should be removed prior to plac-  
ing footings.  
Footings should be carefully aligned so that the supported wall will  
be near the centerline of the footing. The top surface of cast-in-  
place concrete footings should be relatively level and generally  
should not be troweled smooth, as a slightly roughened surface  
enhances the bond between the wall and footing.  
Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete and  
Commentary, ACI 318, and Requirements for Residential Concrete  
Construction and Commentary, ACI 332 establish requirements for  
footing design which take into account the weathering probability,  
as indicated in Figure 10.10.  
Three special types of settlement are sometimes of concern\:  
• Elastic compression\: Soil is a viscoelastic material, which means  
that if a pressure is applied, the soil will deform elastically to a

Shallow foundations are typically the most economical foundations  
to construct where soil and loading conditions permit. Coordination  
with local codes for frost depth and with the underground utilities  
is required. The thickness of the footing has to be coordinated with  
anchor bolt and dowel embedment. Typically, one layer of steel in  
the bottom of the footing is required to resist the bending of the  
footing caused by soil-bearing pressures.  
Minimum sizes of spread footings are specified by the geotechnical  
engineer, to reduce the possibility of local soil failures by punching  
shear of an overall movement of soil mass. Maximum sizes of  
spread footings keep the non-uniform bearing pressure from  
becoming extreme and overstressing the soil.  
Axial loads are distributed in a uniform manner under the footing.  
The allowable bearing pressure necessary to resist the load deter-  
mines footing size.  
Axial loads, combined with shear and overturning forces can be  
resisted by spread footings. The combination of axial load and  
moment forces on the foundation need to be balanced to keep the  
calculated loads on the footing less than the allowable bearing  
pressure of the soil as determined by the geotechnical engineer.

# ELEMENT A\: SUBSTRUCTURE FOUNDATIONS  
Foundation walls are used where basements are not required and  
the need to support a limited load on firm soil exists. Typically, the  
excavation is to below frost depth or as required by the geotechni-  
cal engineer. The wall thickness is typically 8 in. but may be thicker  
if the wall it is supporting is thicker. Minimal amounts of reinforcing  
steel are required to limit cracking. Reinforcing requirements may  
increase as the height of the building wall increases.  
In colder climates, insulation is sometimes provided on the inside  
face of the foundation and under the slab to minimize the cold  
penetration to the interior.  
When required, brick ledges need to be coordinated between  
grade elevation and desired brick coursing. Generally, an isolation  
joint is provided at the slab-wall interface to allow the slab and  
grade wall to settle independently.  
Standard foundation walls may be constructed using concrete,  
masonry units, or wood.  
Concrete unit masonry used in foundation wall construction should  
be laid on a clean footing. Mud, oil, dirt, ice, or other materials that  
reduce the bond should be removed prior to wall construction. To  
accommodate surface irregularities in the footing, set the first unit  
masonry course on a mortar bed ranging in thickness from 1/4 to  
3/4 in. Fully bed the first course of unit masonry including webs;

mortar should not protrude excessively into masonry cells that will  
be grouted. Many building codes require Type M or Type S mortar  
for use in foundation wall construction.  
For reinforced construction, reinforcing steel must be properly  
located. In most cases, vertical reinforcing is positioned toward  
the interior face of below-grade walls to provide the greatest  
resistance to soil pressure.  
A solid top course on the below-grade concrete masonry wall  
spreads loads from the building above. Where only the top course  
is to be grouted, wire mesh or other equivalent grout stop mate-  
rial can be used to contain the grout.  
For residential construction, anchor bolts are typically embedded  
7 in. into the masonry, are 1/2 in. in diameter, and are spaced at a  
maximum of 6 ft. on center, to attach the home to the foundation.  
Wood in direct contact with masonry materials should be pressure-  
treated or naturally decay-resistant.

# ELEMENT A\: SUBSTRUCTURE FOUNDATIONS  
Deep foundations come in several types and, depending on the soil  
conditions, may include driven piles, bored piles \(bored, augered,  
or drilled\) or caissons.  
When the soil near the surface is not suitable to support the build-  
ing loads, it is sometimes necessary to support the structure on  
deep foundations. There are several scenarios when a deep  
foundation makes more sense than a shallow foundation, including  
the following\:  
• If a suitable and reliable bearing stratum is at a much lower  
elevation.  
• If scour from flowing water can occur at the surface.  
• If the structure transmits great loads to the foundation.  
• If the structure transmits tension loads to the foundation.  
• If there are large horizontal loads transmitted to the foundation.  
• If reducing settlement or differential settlement is crucial.  
Driven piles include concrete piles, steel piles, timber piles, and  
composite piles. The resistance to vertical compressive load typi-  
cally results from friction along the sides and end bearing as  
these types of foundations are driven into the ground with a  
mechanical hammer. The geotechnical conditions that make driven  
piles advantageous include cohesionless soils with few boulders.  
Driven piles are selected over bored piles and caissons when  
groundwater or methane gas is present above the suitable bear-  
ing soil layer. These conditions make bored piles difficult and more  
costly than driven piles.  
Bored piles include auger cast grout piles, bored and socketed  
piles, bored concrete piles, drilled caissons, drilled concrete piers  
and shafts, and drilled micropiles. In a similar manner to driven  
piles, resistance to vertical loads typically results from a combina-  
tion of end bearing and side friction. The geological conditions that  
make bored piles advantageous include\: cohesive soils, obstruc-  
tions that can be tolerated with the right size of drill, and a dense  
reliable bearing surface.  
Bored piles are preferred over driven piles when\:  
• The loads are exceptionally high and the bearing surface reliable.  
• Work is in close proximity to existing structures where vibration  
from driven piles may damage existing structures.  
• Inspecting the bearing surface is important, and limited inspec-  
tion of the bearing material is possible.

# ELEMENT A\: SUBSTRUCTURE FOUNDATIONS  
In most instances, more than one deep foundation element is  
required to resist the gravity and lateral loads. In order to distrib-  
ute the loads from the single point column to the multiple founda-  
tion elements, a pile cap is required. Pile caps are thick, reinforced  
concrete blocks that distribute the load from the column to the  
foundations through a combination of flexure and shear.  
Other applications of the pile caps include providing a method  
of connecting the columns to the foundations, and easing the  
construction tolerance issues that occur when installing deep  
foundations. These pile caps are designed and detailed to encase  
a small portion of the deep foundation, and transition to the column  
support elevation, thus providing a convenient location to position  
anchor bolts and column dowels.  
Rams, called hammers, are used to drive piles to impart a vertical  
force to the top of the pile. Most hammers use a weight that is  
repeatedly lifted and dropped on top of the pile.  
Several methods are used to lift the hammer or ram including  
mechanical, hydraulic, and pneumatic, driven devices. Vibratory  
hammers consist of eccentric weights that oscillate at a very high  
frequency, thus imparting a downward vibratory force to the pile.  
These are especially effective in granular soils. Vertical steel sup-  
ports or leads are used to support the hammer and position the  
pile before and during driving. Crawler-type cranes are generally  
used to position the hammer leads over the pile locations.  
Bored piles use various types of boring equipment and tools to  
remove a cylindrical area of soil and replace it with a grout or  
concrete. The boring equipment is generally attached to a tracked  
or rubber-tired vehicle to allow easy access to the pile location. The  
drilling equipment uses a power source \(gas engine, diesel engine,  
or electric motor\) to turn either a continuous flight of augers or a  
short length of auger on the end of the steel shaft. The augers  
transport the soil to the ground surface, where the spoil is  
removed.  
Cohesive soils generally allow an open excavation of a large drilled  
shaft without any additional support. In contrast, granular soils  
and some fill soils require the use of steel casings, or a drilling  
slurry for large shaft construction. Concrete or grout is placed in  
the excavated hole either by direct fall methods or by pumping or  
tremie methods.  
Testing of deep foundations is conducted \(and is often required\) to  
verify the load capacity and structural integrity of deep foundation  
elements. Load testing of deep foundation shafts is sometimes  
done to provide greater design capacity than can be obtained with  
conventional analytical methods or with presumptive values com-  
monly used in a particular region. Two common types of testing are\:  
• Static load test\: This is the most common type of load test for a  
deep foundation. It consists of incrementally loading a pile with  
a static load at a specified rate, and measuring the movement of  
the pile. The pile is normally loaded to twice the design load of  
the pile, which will result in a minimum safety factor of 2.  
Compressive loading is the most common static load test,  
although tension and lateral load testing is sometimes per-  
formed if such loads are deemed critical to the structure.

• Dynamic load test\: Piles can also be tested using dynamic loads.  
The pile dynamic analyzer \(PDA\) is a device that measures the  
response of a pile under a dynamic impact load such as the driv-  
ing hammer. The results from the PDA are used to determine the  
most probable static load capacity for each strike of the hammer.  
A common analytical tool used to predict driven pile capacities is  
the wave equation. The hammer-pile-soil system is mathemati-  
cally modeled in the computer program to simulate the driving of  
the pile. The output is the estimated ultimate capacity of the pile  
at various driving resistances, and the induced stresses in the  
pile at those resistances. This analytical tool is very useful for  
determining what size of pile, as well as what size and type of  
hammer, are required to achieve a desired capacity in the given  
soil profile.  
spread footing becomes excessive or overlaps adjacent footings. For  
structures that cannot tolerate differential settlement between col-  
umns, mat foundations become ideal. Structures that use mat foun-  
dations include chimneys, silos, and large pieces of equipment.  
Mat foundations combine all the column loads and distribute them to  
the soil on a single large foundation. Mat foundations are used where  
the allowable soil-bearing pressures are low and the size of a single  
Base isolation of structures refers to the concept of detaching the  
structure from the foundation for the purpose of reducing the level  
of seismic forces imparted to the structure through horizontal  
ground-shaking by changing the dynamic characteristics of the  
structure. The separation of foundation and structure is accom-  
plished by providing a flexible connection between the two that  
allows for horizontal movement of the foundation at a different  
frequency of that from the structure above. Energy-dissipating  
devices are used in conjunction with the isolators to control struc-  
tural displacements.  
Reduced demands on the lateral force-resisting structural elements,  
including foundations, allows for a more economical design of these  
elements. By limiting the amount of force that is delivered to the  
structure, and by also limiting the amount of movement, damage to  
the structure, facade, and building contents is significantly lessened.  
Base isolation of structures in high seismic regions is most appro-  
priate for low- to midrise buildings, essential service buildings  
\(such as hospitals and police and fire stations\), and buildings with  
valuable contents \(such as museums and scientific research  
facilities\). Base isolation has been successfully used for both new  
and existing structures.  
When using base isolation, it is important to ensure that the isola-  
tors are the only places where the building touches the surround-  
ing earth. This is normally accomplished by positioning the building  
in a large, excavated area, and connecting the building to the sur-  
rounding ground with flexible “bridges.” The base isolators are  
usually located in a subbasement dedicated to their use.  
A recent variation of base isolation is offered by a family of devices  
that absorb or dissipate energy and change the response of a struc-  
ture to seismic activity. These devices are most useful for retro exist-  
ing structures without the need for an entirely new structural system.

encountered in slab-on-grade design delineate soil according to  
grain size, moisture content, plastic, and liquid limit. Atterberg  
plastic and liquid limits indicate the percentage of moisture where  
soil acts as a semisolid, or acts as a liquid, and will affect capacity  
and performance of the slab. Unified soil classifications are the  
most recognized and preferred by geotechnical firms. The base  
material should be compactable and well drained and provide uni-  
form load-bearing support; coarse-grained materials are most  
likely to be specified for this application. Soil materials designated  
as fine-grained are generally associated with either a high degree  
of compressibility or instability resulting from volume changes, and  
may allow the floor slab to settle or sink over a long period. When  
fine-grained soils are encountered, input from the geotechnical  
engineer is advised.  
The performance of concrete slabs depends on the specific charac-  
teristics of ingredients; therefore the concrete mix design must be  
reviewed for strength, shrinkage, finishability, and durability. The  
Portland cement content and the content of other cementitious  
products, if used, should be sufficient for finishability and durabil-  
ity, per ACI 301. The setting characteristics of concrete should be  
relatively predictable, and concrete should not experience exces-  
sive retardation and surface crusting. Concrete floors exposed to  
freezing and thawing should have water/cementitious ratios of no  
more than 0.5, and if subjected to deicing chemicals, of no more  
than 0.45. Concrete in these exposure conditions should also have  
air contents between 4 and 7 percent.  
Expect some cracking in concrete construction. Generally, cracking is  
controlled with joints and reinforcement. However, not all cracks indi-  
cate errors or performance problems, and not all cracks need to be  
repaired. These types of joints are classified as one of the following\:  
• Isolation joints\: Allow complete freedom of horizontal and verti-  
cal movement between the floor and adjoining walls not requiring  
lateral restraint from the slab, columns, equipment foundations,  
or other points of restraint \(such as drains, manholes, sumps,  
and so on\).  
• Construction joints\: Define the extent of the individual placement  
of concrete, generally in conformity with a predetermined joint  
layout. These can also function as contraction or isolation joints.  
• Contraction \(control\) joints\: Induce cracking at preselected loca-  
tions, usually at column lines, with intermediate joints located at  
equal spaces between column lines. Spacing of contraction joints  
depends on the method of design, slab thickness, type and  
amount of reinforcement, base friction, layout of foundations,  
and curing, among other items. Saw-cut contraction joints  
should be made as early as practical after finishing the slab; and  
in areas with wet conditions, hygienic and dust control require-  
ments, or where the floor is subjected to traffic by hard-wheeled  
vehicles such as forklifts, they should be filled. A semirigid filler  
with a Shore Hardness “A” of at least 80 should be used in joints  
supporting forklift traffic.  
Reinforcement in slabs, including reinforcing bars, welded wire  
fabric, steel or synthetic fibers, is provided primarily to control the  
width of cracks caused by shrinkage. Only when reinforcing steel  
is properly sized and placed can the effect of shrinkage cracks be  
controlled. The best way to reduce or prevent shrinkage cracking is  
to pay close attention to the smoothness of the base, the quality of  
the concrete, the curing process, and the joint spacing and timing  
of the joint cutting.  
ACI 302 recommends a minimum of 10-mil thickness for vapor  
retarders. This material will limit vapor transmission from the soil  
support system through concrete slabs, which can adversely affect  
moisture-impermeable or moisture-sensitive floor finishes. ACI  
302 recommendations regarding where to place the vapor retarder  
are governed by local conditions and construction sequences.  
Joints in the concrete slab-on-grade are provided to reduce the  
frequency and width of random cracks caused by concrete shrink-  
age, or to allow for the practical limits of concrete placement.

In general, concrete floor slabs are monolithically finished by float-  
ing and troweling, to achieve a smooth and dense surface finish.  
ACI 302 provides guidance for appropriate finishing procedures to  
control achievable floor flatness. ACI 302, ACI 360, and ACI 117  
provide guidance for flatness selection, as well as techniques by  
which flatness and levelness are produced and measured.  
Floor finish tolerance is measured by placing a freestanding 10-ft  
straightedge on the slab surface, or by F-Numbers. The preferred  
method of measuring flatness and levelness is the F-Number  
System. Special finishes are available to improve appearance, as  
well as surface properties. These include sprinkled \(shake\) finishes  
or high-strength toppings, either as monolithic or separate surfaces.  
# ELEMENT A\: SUBSTRUCTURE CAST-IN-PLACE CONCRETE SLAB  
• Type 2, Slab-reinforced for shrinkage\: Shrinkage cracking is  
controlled by a nominal amount of distributed reinforcement or  
steel fibers to hold tightly and prevent cracks that may develop  
between joints. Joint spacing is usually the same or slightly  
larger than Type 1 concrete slabs.  
• Type 3, Shrinkage-compensating concrete slab\: The shrinkage-  
compensating concrete used in this slab contains an expansive  
admixture or Type K concrete with reinforcing, which is placed in  
the upper half of the slab to limit the initial slab expansion and  
to restrain the slab’s subsequent drying shrinkage. Joints can be  
spaced farther apart than in Type 1 or 2 slabs.  
• Type 4, Slab post-tensioned to offset shrinkage\: These slabs  
contain post-tensioning tendons intended for crack control. The  
prestressing force allows a wide spacing of construction joints  
with no intermediate contraction joints.  
• Type 5, Slab post-tensioned and/or reinforced with active pre-  
stress\: These slabs are designed following the Post-Tension  
Institute’s procedures using active prestress, which permits  
thinner slabs. They are reinforced with post-tensioning tendons  
and mild steel reinforcement, and incorporate monolithic beams  
to increase the rigidity of the section. In addition, these slabs  
are designed to accept structural edge loading from building  
superstructures, as well as to resist the forces caused by swell-  
ing or shrinking of unsuitable soils.  
• Type 6, Structurally reinforced slabs\: These slabs are designed  
as reinforced concrete slabs to allow cracking at some prede-  
termined level of loading.  
Subdrainage is a very different engineering design from surface  
drainage. Surface drainage intercepts and collects stormwater  
runoff and conveys it away from a building and site with the use of  
large inlets and storm drains. Subsurface drainage typically is  
smaller in size and capacity, designed to intercept the slower  
underground flows of a natural groundwater table, underground  
stream, or infiltration of soils from surface sources. Surface and  
subsurface drainage typically requires discharge either through a  
pumping station or by gravity.  
Please see section Site Civil Utilities - Subsurface Drainage  
Systems, images 16.106 through 16.111 for perimeter building  
foundation drainage systems and details.  
There are six identifiable slab types that are commonly used per  
ACI 360\:  
• Type 1, Plain concrete slab\: This type contains no reinforcement  
or fibers. Joint spacings are 24 to 36 times the slab thickness.  
Up to a maximum of 18 ft. is recommended to reduce shrinkage  
cracking.  
Cause Shrinkage of cement  
paste at exposed  
concrete surfaces due  
to concrete mix, too-  
wet excessive bleeding,  
overtroweling surface,  
or rapid drying of  
surface.  
Water at the concrete  
surface evaporates too  
rapidly due to job-site  
conditions such as low  
humidity, high wind  
speeds, high concrete  
temperatures, or high  
to moderate air  
temperatures.  
As concrete cools and  
hardens, concrete volume  
shrinks; cracking will  
occur if slab is restrained  
at any point.  
Subgrade settlement Premature excessive  
loading on slab  
Same as for slabs on  
grade; also, heavier  
amounts of  
reinforcement and  
nature of formed or  
shored construction  
Flexible forms and  
insufficient vibration  
can increase  
likelihood.  
Subgrade or formwork  
settlement, early  
volume changes,  
construction overloads,  
errors in design and  
detailing  
Effect Unsightly crazing of  
surface layer, although  
surface is probably  
sound  
Parallel cracking, fairly  
wide at the exposed  
surface but shallow;  
doesn’t typically extend  
to slab edge. Crack  
spacing and length  
vary greatly.  
Random or regularly  
spaced cracks, usually  
passing completely  
through slab; during saw  
cutting of joints, crack  
may jump ahead of saw  
cut  
Slab will bend and crack Punch-through at edge  
by heavy equipment,  
etc.  
Longitudinal cracks  
develop over  
reinforcement bars;  
can cause  
reinforcement bar  
corrosion  
General cracking  
Preventive  
measures  
Reduce amount and  
rate of shrinkage at  
concrete surface by  
avoiding wet mixes,  
limiting bleeding by  
increasing sand or air  
content, limiting  
troweling or not  
troweling too early, or  
curing as soon as  
possible.  
Reduce rate at which  
surface moisture  
evaporates by erecting  
windbreaks or building  
walls before slab,  
avoiding wet mixes,  
dampening subgrade  
before concrete  
placement, curing as  
soon as possible, or  
avoiding vapor barrier  
under slab unless  
necessary.  
Not always preventable;  
careful joint design or  
reinforcement may help.  
Other measures\: tool or  
saw cut joints 1/4 of slab  
thickness, min.; time saw  
cut according to concrete  
curing rate; locate  
contraction joints at  
column lines, min.; for  
unreinforced slabs, space  
joints at 24 to 36 times  
slab thickness, max.;  
post-tension at slab;  
isolate slabs from  
adjoining structures with  
preformed joint filler or if  
continuity is required,  
increase slab  
reinforcement.  
Compact subgrade well Generally, curing  
periods of 4 to 7 days,  
followed by 1 to 2 days  
of drying  
Proper form design  
and sufficient vibration  
or revibration\: use  
lowest possible slump  
and increase concrete  
cover.

cracking is controlled with joints and reinforcement; however, not all  
cracks indicate errors or performance problems, and not all cracks  
need to be repaired.

# CRAWL SPACE CONSTRUCTION  
The best understanding of the interrelated issues surrounding  
control of heat, air, and moisture \(HAM\) inside crawl spaces and  
the transfer of HAM to the building interior suggests that it is  
preferable to treat the crawl space as part of the interior condi-  
tioned environment.  
Arguments against ventilating crawl spaces include\:  
• Venting of a crawl space is meant to keep moisture within  
acceptable levels; pulling hot, humid air into the space is coun-  
terproductive, especially when it is likely that the ground surface  
temperatures may be below the dew point temperature.  
• Insulated floor assemblies are rarely constructed airtight and  
allow air infiltration/exfiltration.  
• Insulated floor assemblies are rarely as warm or as comfort-  
able as floors with a conditioned environment on both sides.  
• Conditioned spaces above hot, humid, ventilated crawl spaces  
create a vapor drive, which may result in excess load on the  
HVAC, uncontrolled condensation, and potentially rot and mold.  
• Crawl spaces are frequently used for distribution of mechanical  
ductwork. The distribution ductwork is outside of the thermal  
envelope and, therefore, experiences greater loss than if inte-  
rior to the thermal envelope. The penetrations required for the  
ductwork create more opportunities for air leakage between the  
conditioned and unconditioned space. In hot, humid conditions,  
there is a likelihood that the vapor retarder on the duct insula-  
tion will not be perfect, causing condensation on the ductwork  
to occur, thereby adding more moisture to an already damp  
environment.  
• Sanitary sewer and domestic water supply lines likely pass  
through the unconditioned crawl space and may be susceptible  
to freezing and condensation.  
Recommendations for crawl spaces include the following\:  
• Codes generally require ventilation of crawl spaces; however,  
they also provide exemptions for a variety of conditions, specifi-  
cally\: “where warranted by climatic conditions,” “where con-  
tinuously operated mechanical ventilation is provided,” and  
“when the perimeter walls are insulated.” Most exemptions  
require the ground surface to be covered with a vapor retarder.  
Refer to the specific building codes in effect for all requirements.  
• Cover the ground surface in the crawl space with a vapor  
retarder. Tape seams and seal penetrations. Consider protecting  
the vapor retarder with a rough concrete mud slab. Mechanically  
fasten the retarder to the foundation at the perimeter with a  
nailing strip. In cold climates, it may be desirable to insulate the  
entire ground surface.  
• Insulate the crawl space walls as required by code. Follow rec-  
ommendations for exterior walls regarding the permeability of  
insulation materials, air sealing, and the use of vapor retarders.  
Insulation may need to be fire-rated, especially board insula-  
tion; or use noncombustible-type insulation. If possible, locate  
insulation outside of the dampproofing on the foundation wall.  
• Ventilate the crawl space, typically with a small supply duct at  
code-specified rate, normally 1 cfm for each 50 sq. ft., and pro-  
vide connection to the return air plenum, either directly through  
the interior space above via transfer grilles. Locate the supply  
and return points to evenly mix and distribute the air  
• Alternative crawl space drying methods include a permanent  
dehumidifier or exhaust fans controlled by humidistats, with  
makeup air from the interior and ducted to the exterior.  
However, this solution may use a large amount of energy.  
• Pay attention to exterior wall detailing and proper drainage to  
keep water away from the crawl space.  
• Crawl spaces used as the supply plenum to the remainder of the  
house require special treatment to maintain air quality.  
Two primary difficulties encountered with the insulation of floor  
assemblies are providing a continuous vapor retarder on the warm  
side, and keeping the floor warm, even with insulation. In cold cli-  
mates, the floor will be uncomfortable for any long-term occupan-  
cy. If possible, it is best to avoid insulation applied directly to  
the bottom of floor assemblies; instead, use an insulated soffit.  
If direct application is unavoidable, consider the following two  
methods\:  
• Board insulation is typically applied to the underside of the  
structure by impaling over adhesive-applied stickpins and  
crimped with large washers. Mineral wool insulation is a good  
choice because it is noncombustible and performs well even if it  
becomes slightly damp from condensation.  
• Sprayed insulation can be cellulose-based, mineral-based, or  
foam. Closed-cell foam can eliminate the need for a separate  
vapor barrier.

# ELEMENT A\: SUBSTRUCTURE BASEMENT CONSTRUCTION  
# BASEMENT CONSTRUCTION  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
In residential construction, particularly in the colder climates,  
basements are inexpensive spaces, because the frost depths  
require excavations deep enough that a little more excavation can  
result in a habitable area, providing space for the utilities and  
warmth for the first floor.  
In commercial construction, basements are sometimes provided  
for the mechanical and electrical facility services. Basements can  
also be economical if a relatively thin layer of poor soil is encoun-  
tered. The cost of removing and replacing the poor soil can be off-  
set by the excavation and installation of a basement.  
Basement walls may be constructed of various materials, includ-  
ing, concrete, masonry, and wood.  
Concrete basement walls may be either cast-in-place or precast.  
Cast-in-place concrete basement walls provide a cost-effective  
means of supporting a floor and resisting soil pressures.  
Commercial and residential applications of concrete basement  
walls are prevalent. Forms are easily placed in the excavation on  
the footings. Reinforcing steel may be tied on- or off-site, and is  
placed within the wall formwork. Depending on the soil and  
groundwater conditions, dampproofing should typically be used on  
foundation walls and waterproofing is generally required on base-  
ment walls prior to backfilling. Unless lateral bracing is utilized,  
the top of the basement wall must be supported by the first floor  
and the base of the wall by the footing or slab-on-grade before  
backfilling against the wall can begin. Keeping the wall heights  
uniform, as well as reducing the number of penetrations and main-  
taining a simple plan configuration, will help reduce the final cost  
of the wall.  
Precast concrete basement walls enable basement construction in  
less time than conventional cast-in-place concrete. In addition to  
time and construction methods other advantages of precast con-  
crete include the ability of the precast supplier to utilize concrete  
admixtures that focus on ultimate strength, rather than cure time  
and temperature. Precast manufacturers are able to produce  
mixes that cure to 5000 psi, which is stronger than concrete unit  
masonry or cast-in-place concrete walls. Additionally, better con-  
trol of the concrete mixture and curing environment allows the use  
of low water/cement ratios, which results in a dense material that  
reduces water penetration.

Masonry walls have long served as foundations for structures.  
Today, most masonry basement walls consist of a single wythe,  
hollow, or solid concrete masonry units, depending on the required  
bearing capacity. The walls are reinforced as necessary to resist  
lateral loads. Generally, such reinforcing should be held as close to  
the interior face shell as possible, to provide the maximum tensile  
strength.

ungrouted

Basement walls should protect against heat and cold, insect infes-  
tation \(particularly termites\), fire, and penetration of water and  
soil gases.  
If radon is a major concern, the top course of the masonry and the  
course of masonry at or below the slab should be constructed of  
solid units or fully grouted hollow units. Foundation drain, used to  
collect and drain condensation moisture from basements, should  
be avoided in areas where soil-gas entry is a concern.  
Architectural masonry units may be used to improve the appear-  
ance of the wall. Masonry units with architectural finishes facing  
the interior can be used for economical construction of finished  
basement space.  
Masonry easily accommodates any floor plan, and returns and  
corners increase the structural performance of the wall for lateral  
load resistance.

# ELEMENT A\: SUBSTRUCTURE BASEMENT CONSTRUCTION  
Backfilling against a basement wall is not appropriate, unless  
resistance to the overturning load has been provided. The most  
common approach is to construct the first-floor slab before back-  
filling. Alternate approaches include designing the wall as a  
freestanding retaining wall, or providing temporary lateral brac-  
ing for the basement wall. A retaining wall is either a freestanding  
or a laterally braced wall that bears against soil or other fill  
material that resists lateral forces from the material in contact  
with the face of the wall. Below-grade portions of basement walls  
are considered retaining walls.  
By constructing a freestanding retaining wall or providing lateral  
bracing on the perimeter, backfilling operations can progress with-  
out the first floor being complete. An additional cost is involved in  
constructing the basement wall as a freestanding retaining wall,  
because more concrete, reinforcing, and excavation are required.

1.0 to 1.5 is used for design, with the lateral movement required to  
achieve this passive resistance limited to between 1/4 and 1/2 in.  
Soil, similar to water, exerts pressure on the back face of basement  
walls. The pressure exerted by water is equal to the density of  
water times the depth. Soil also exerts pressure in proportion to  
the density of the soil times the depth of the wall. This proportion  
is based on an earth pressure coefficient, which is dependent on  
the type and magnitude of soil movement and flexibility of the wall.  
It is important to understand these influences before designing  
retaining walls.  
Four types of soil pressure need to be understood and resisted by  
retaining walls\: active, at-rest, passive, and surcharge.  
Active soil pressure exists when a wall moves inward and the soil  
fails \(shears\) in the zone right behind the wall. The active soil pres-  
sure is dependent on the shear resistance \(i.e., strength\) of the  
soil. The higher the strength of the soil the lower the active pres-  
sure on the wall. The retaining wall must be flexible to allow for  
enough movement to occur so the active pressure can develop.  
Unfortunately, most concrete basement walls do not behave flexi-  
bly enough to allow for the full active condition to develop; how-  
ever, freestanding retaining walls rotate about the base to allow  
for active pressure to be used for design. An active earth pressure  
coefficient of typically around 0.30 to 0.35 is used for compacted  
sand wall backfill.  
Surcharge loading is an often-overlooked load on a foundation  
wall, especially for construction surcharge loadings. Surcharge  
loads can be due to a number of sources; car, truck, or pedestrian  
traffic, storage of materials, landscaping berms, snow piles, etc.  
Additional lateral pressures on the walls occur due to the vertical  
surcharge loads applied at or near the surface. Uniform surcharge  
pressures are typically given in feet-of-soil equivalents \(such as 1,  
2, or 3 ft. of soil\). This typically equates to 100, 200, or 300 psf of  
surcharge loading. The effective lateral load from the uniform  
surcharge is computed with the same earth pressure coefficient  
used in calculating the lateral load on the foundation wall\: either  
the active or the at-rest coefficient.  
Various types of surcharge loadings should be considered when  
designing the foundation walls. Construction loads are typically  
point loads, and transient. The lateral load distribution of concen-  
trated-point loads is a bulb-type loading, and affects only a short  
length of the wall. The uniform load of storage material can exist  
over a great length of the wall, and can have a significant effect on  
the design of the wall. Because emergency equipment often must  
have close access to a building, foundation walls should be  
designed to resist the large concentrated loads of fire and emer-  
gency equipment.  
At-rest soil pressures occur when there is no wall movement  
\(inward or outward\) as a result of placement of soil against the  
wall. This condition most often occurs when backfilling against rigid  
or stiff walls which deflect very little under the lateral soil pres-  
sures. Since there is no soil movement, the soils do not shear and  
the pressures are transmitted elastically to the walls. Typical base-  
ment walls are considered rigid enough to resist the soil in an at-  
rest condition. The coefficient of at-rest soil pressure is typically  
around 0.50 to 0.55 for compacted sand wall backfill.  
Passive soil pressures occur when a foundation wall actually  
moves into the soil away from the wall due to an external force.  
This typically happens when the lateral loads on the structure are  
resisted by the foundation. Here, the soil is being pushed away  
from the wall with the pressure increasing with the amount of lat-  
eral wall movement until an ultimate \(maximum\) pressure occurs.  
The ultimate passive pressure is also based on the shearing resis-  
tance of the soil. Care must be taken to determine how much  
movement is anticipated for the level of passive resistance needed  
to resist the lateral loads from the structure. Typical values of  
ultimate passive soil coefficients can range around 2.0 to 5.0 for  
compacted sand wall backfill, but the movement required to obtain  
these values is greater than most structures can tolerate.  
Therefore, a lower “allowable” passive soil coefficient of around  
Consult a geotechnical engineer to determine soil types and  
groundwater levels, as well as their effect on drainage and water-  
proofing methods. Consult a waterproofing specialist to determine  
a specific design approach for problem soils and conditions. Sites  
may have groundwater contamination that will degrade the dura-  
bility of the waterproofing materials. Generally, waterproofing will  
be necessary if a head of water is expected against the basement  
wall or under the slab. Because groundwater levels can vary with  
seasons, it is important to understand these seasonal fluctuations  
and design for the maximum expected head.  
Foundation drainage is recommended when the groundwater level  
may rise above the top of the floor slab or when the foundation is  
subject to hydrostatic pressure after heavy rain. Geosynthetic  
drainage material conveys water to the drainage piping, thus  
reducing hydrostatic pressure. It is important to understand the  
hydrostatic pressures exerted on the floor slab and wall systems if  
the drainage system is not adequate to remove all the water.  
Special negative-side coatings on the interior face of a foundation  
wall, such as metallic oxide, are recommended only when the  
exterior is not accessible \(such as pits and trenches, and in par-  
ticular, elevator pits\).  
Grading around the building is an important part of the overall  
water management plan. The backfilling operation usually results  
in a more porous material than the adjacent undisturbed soil,  
which makes it easier for water to collect next to the building.  
Finished grade should slope away from the building, and an imper-  
vious layer of soil placed on top of the backfill against the building.  
Drainage from downspouts should be diverted away from the  
foundations.  
Types of waterproofing include built-up bituminous, sheet, fluid-  
applied, cementitious and reactive, and bentonite.  
• Built-up bituminous\: Composed of alternating layers of bitumi-  
nous sheets and viscous bituminous coatings. Bituminous  
waterproofing includes built-up asphalt and cold-tar waterproof-  
ing systems.  
• Sheet waterproofing \: Formed with sheets of elastomeric, bitu-  
minous, modified bituminous or thermoplastic materials. Sheet  
waterproofing may be either mechanically attached or self-  
adhered. Sheet waterproofing provides an impermeable surface  
to water penetration.  
• Fluid -applied \: Applied in a hot or cold viscous state. Includes hot  
fluid-applied rubberized asphalt. As with sheet waterproofing,  
fluid-applied waterproofing will bridge minor cracks in a con-  
crete surface.  
• Cementitious and reactive\: Types of waterproofing that achieve  
waterproof qualities through chemical reaction and include poly-  
mer modified cement, crystalline, and metal oxide waterproofing  
systems. Metal oxide is recommended for use when the exterior  
surface is not accessible, as in the case of an elevator pit.  
• Bentonite\: Formed from clay into panels and composite sheets.  
When moistened, the clay swells and takes on a gel-like consis-  
tency, forming an impermeable retarder when confined.  
Bentonite clay works well only when moistened. For applications  
where the water table fluctuates, there may be a time lag  
between the rising water table and when the bentonite takes  
effect, during which time there is the possibility of water infiltra-  
tion. Therefore, when the water table varies, caution is in order  
when relying on bentonite clay for waterproofing. Proper coor-  
dination between the wall construction details and the water-  
proofing termination is required.  
At the interface of the foundation wall and slab, waterstops are  
placed on top of the footing, at vertical concrete keyed wall joints.  
Most waterproofing materials require a stable, rigid, and level  
substrate. Generally, a mud slab \(subslab that is nonreinforced and  
nonstructural\) is used when the waterproofing material is placed  
below the structural slab and/or when a solid working surface is  
needed on unstable soils. When waterproofing materials are  
placed on top of the structural slab, a protective cover, such as  
another concrete slab, is required.

# ELEMENT A\: SUBSTRUCTURE BASEMENT CONSTRUCTION  
Protection of waterproofing or coatings during construction and  
backfilling is essential. Protection materials should be selected  
according to soil, climate, and cost requirements. These materials  
include the following\:  
• Composite drainage board \: Recommended when water is fre-  
quently present in soils surrounding foundations. Usually, this is  
made up of a rigid open-weave material, approximately 3/4 in.  
thick, covered on both sides by a geotextile filter fabric that  
prevents small stones or other materials from clogging the  
drainage route of water inside. Typically, the drainage material  
is terminated at drain tiles at the bottom of the foundation. This  
system has a higher in-place cost than other protection board  
materials.  
• Board insulation \: Used above the frost line or if ground tem-  
peratures are low. Rigid insulation boards are usually made of  
expanded or extruded polystyrene, with a minimum thickness of  
1/4 in. when used as protection board only, and 1 in. or thicker  
if thermal insulation properties are desired.  
• Protection board \: Used only to protect waterproofing; it does  
not drain or insulate. Protection board is usually made of 1/8-in.  
asphalt-impregnated fiberboard or ¼-in. extruded polystyrene.  
This is the least expensive material when protection of the  
waterproofing is the only requirement.  
• Grout \: Packed around pipes penetrating the foundation and  
other types of waterproofing, grout should contain a mixture of  
iron oxide, which chemically alters the grout to be more water-  
resistant.  
Dampproofing is generally provided to reduce or prohibit the  
absorption of condensation and high-humidity into below-grade  
concrete or masonry and to reduce the likelihood of water not  
under a head of pressure from moving through or up the construc-  
tion. Examples of applications requiring dampproofing include on  
the back side of site retaining walls or at basement walls where  
there is no head of water.  
Dampproofing is not “water-tight” and will not perform to the  
same levels as waterproofing, and so should not be used in appli-  
cations that require waterproofing.  
In addition to the desire to resist water intrusion through a wall,  
dampproofing has historically been utilized to prevent water intru-  
sion into concrete or masonry below grade, as a means to limit or  
eliminate “rising damp”—that is, a condition in which moisture is  
absorbed into the subgrade construction and travels upward by  
capillary action to drier materials such as masonry or wood. Water  
infiltration of this type can lead to rotting of wood, efflorescence of  
masonry, or freeze-thaw masonry damage, as well as corrosion of  
unprotected or improperly protected metals \(such as light-gauge  
steel framing\). Note that this may not be a problem only at exterior  
walls but can also be problematic at foundations and piers \(espe-  
cially crawl spaces\) and within the building interior if there are  
unfavorable water conditions.  
Another appropriate use of dampproofing is at site-retaining walls  
that may have special finishes such as architectural precast con-  
crete applied to a structural retaining wall. In this case, it would be  
highly desirable to prohibit excessive water penetration from the  
back side to be transmitted to the decorative finish. Waterproofing  
is sometimes not appropriate in these conditions; however, damp-  
proofing often provides the correct level of protection in these  
cases.  
Dampproofing is most often a spray-, roller-, or brush-applied  
bituminous material \(asphalts\), but may include cementitious and  
sheet materials. Fluid-applied and cementitious applications have  
little capability to bridge across cracks or discontinuities of the  
concrete or masonry wall to which they are applied, and have very  
limited capability to accept movement.

Insulation requirements are proportional to heating loads. The  
foundation is often underinsulated and can be a major source of  
heat loss. The desirable insulation level depends on the use of the  
basement space, basement temperature, and insulation levels in  
the rest of the building. An approximate thermal optimum is\:  
T T  
− \( \)  
bsmt 0  
R  
ins  
=  
− \( \) × − R R ref wall  
T T  
1 0  
Rins = R-value to be added to basement wall above grade  
Rref = R-value of superstructure wall  
Rwall = R-value of uninsulated basement foundation wall  
Tbsmt = Average seasonal temperature of basement  
T1 = Average seasonal temperature of living space  
T0 = Average seasonal outdoor temperature  
The added foundation insulation above grade is Rins. It should  
decrease with depth by R-2 per foot in ordinary soils and R-1.5 in  
wet soils. A horizontal skirt can be used to reduce floor perimeter  
losses. Exterior insulation keeps the wall warm and eliminates  
condensation and thermal bridges. As seasonal basement temper-  
ature decreases, losses to it from the superstructure increase, and  
basement ceiling R-values should increase. As a very rough rule,  
the basement ceiling R-value should be greater than \(Rref−Rins\).  
There are basically two insulation types used for foundations\:  
• Expanded polystyrene \: Also known as “bead board,” this is  
generally a low-density, low-compressive strength material that  
is supplied in sheet form, usually 2 to 4 ft. wide and 8 ft. long  
\(2 in. is a typical thickness of insulation\).  
• Extruded polystyrene \: This is a sheet material that is also used  
as masonry cavity wall insulation. This material can come in  
compressive strengths of 20 to 100 psi in sheets of 2 to 4 ft.  
wide and 8 ft. in length \(2 in. is a fairly typical basement insula-  
tion thickness\).  
Both the extruded and expanded polystyrene insulations are sus-  
ceptible to chemical reaction to direct contact with petroleum-  
based chemicals in the soil, or driven by percolation from the  
surface.  
Expanded or cellular glass \(also known as “stink board” because  
of the sulphur that is trapped within the closed cell-glass structure\)  
is inert and may be the best insulation product in these situations.  
However, if cellular glass products are used in areas prone to  
freezing temperatures, special precautions are necessary, to pre-  
vent deterioration and damage to the insulation caused by freezing  
of water that gets into the open cells at the insulation edges. The  
edges of the board are cut and, therefore, have open cells along  
the edges. The edges of these sheets must be sealed when  
exposed to freezing temperatures.  
maintenance and large-scale traffic circulation. The design should  
take into account control and filtering of storm and drainage water,  
to avoid percolation and potential contamination of adjoining soils.  
It should be noted that the insulation sheets can also be used as a  
very effective protection board for waterproofing. Some water-  
proofing manufacturers have strong recommendations regarding  
the appropriate type of protection board.  
This insulation also comes in sheet form, 2 by 4 ft.; thicknesses can  
vary according to need. Cell-glass insulation may be appropriate  
for projects requiring foundation insulation adjoining vehicle

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS  
# DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS  
Of primary importance to the shell of a building is the mediation  
between the exterior and interior environment. Proper design and  
detailing of the building enclosure requires an understanding of the  
specific characteristics of both the desired interior environmental  
conditions and specific exterior environmental conditions, on both  
a macro and micro scale.  
When reading the content of this chapter, keep in mind the follow-  
ing definitions of concepts and principles\:  
• Air barriers\: Materials or combinations of materials that form a  
continuous envelope around all sides of the conditioned space to  
resist the passage of air. Joints, seams, transitions, penetra-  
tions, and gaps must be sealed. The air barrier must be capable  
of withstanding combined positive and negative wind load and  
fan and stack pressure without damage or displacement. The air  
barrier must be at least as durable as the overlying construction  
and be detailed to accommodate anticipated building movement.  
An air barrier may or may not be a vapor retarder.  
• Vapor barriers and retarders\: Without industrywide consensus,  
materials with a perm rating less than 1 are interchangeably  
called a vapor barrier or vapor retarder \(IBC and IEC 2003 use  
vapor retarder\). More important than the term is to understand  
a few basic principles\:  
• Vapor diffusion through materials with perm ratings less than  
1 is nearly inconsequential, but even small gaps or holes can  
easily transport many times as much water vapor.  
• All materials have some greater or lesser degree of resis-  
tance to diffusion, and their placement in an enclosure  
assembly, whether intended as a retarder or not, will affect  
wetting and, more importantly, drying of an assembly.  
• Insulation\: A material that slows the flow of heat through con-  
duction.  
• Radiant barriers\: A material, usually metallic or shiny, that  
reflects radiant thermal energy.  
• Weather barrier \(Water-resistant barrier\)\: A material that is  
resistant to the penetration of water in the liquid state, or is  
waterproof. It may or may not be an air barrier or vapor  
retarder. The face of the weather barrier is sometimes called the  
drainage plane .  
• Barrier wall\: A wall assembly that resists moisture with a con-  
tinuous waterproof membrane, or with a plane of weather  
barrier material thick enough to prevent absorbed moisture  
from penetrating to the interior.  
• Drained cavity wall\: A wall assembly with an outer water-  
shedding layer over an air cavity, and with a weather barrier.  
The cavity is flashed and weeped to drain incidental water.  
• Drainage plane wall\: A wall assembly with a continuous water-  
resistant barrier under an outer water-shedding layer. The lack  
of a cavity limits the amount of water that can be quickly  
drained.  
• Pressure-equalized rainscreen wall\: A wall assembly that  
resists all the physical forces that can transport water across a  
joint in the outer or “rainscreen” layer. Kinetic energy forces are  
controlled by venting a cavity behind the rainscreen and, thus,  
allowing the pressure differential across the joint to be equal-  
ized. An air barrier and compartmentalization of the cavity are  
required to control the pressure equalization. The cavity is  
flashed and weeped to drain incidental moisture.  
The United States has widely varying climates. More than the obvi-  
ous extremes of Miami and Alaska are the subtler—and just as  
important—variations within the contingent states. The ANSI/

ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1, Map of Climate Zones for the  
United States reproduced herein dictates zones based on heating  
and cooling requirements. \(Note\: A simplified map of climatic zones  
can be found in Moisture Control Handbook\: Principles and  
Practices for Residential and Small Commercial Buildings, by  
Joseph W. Lstiburek and John Carmody, 1996.\) There are six zones  
within the continental states and Hawaii, plus two more for Alaska.  
Within these zones are subzones for moist, dry, marine, and warm-  
humid.  
As this chapter will demonstrate, solutions appropriate for one  
zone may be totally unsuited for another. SEI/ASCE 7, “Minimum  
Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures,” and other simi-  
lar standards establish the wind, snow, and seismic structural  
loads on buildings. Again, there is wide variation in wind speed,  
snowfall, and ground movement. In addition to the base loads,  
localized conditions such as surrounding topography and adjacent  
buildings can cause wide variances in the environmental influenc-  
es. Figure 11.2 shows the annual precipitation for North America.  
Suggested types of exterior enclosure systems that will meet the  
minimum level of service and reliability are correlated to the rain-  
fall levels.  
Environmental conditions to be maintained within the building also  
influence the design of the shell. Buildings with requirements for  
high or low levels of humidity, tight temperature tolerances, pres-  
sure differentials to the exterior, high-reliability containment,  
acoustic isolation, protection from blast or forced entry, high  
indoor air quality, or other extraordinary requirements will require  
particular attention to system selection and detailing, in concert  
with consideration of the exterior climate.  
In addition to the obvious structural loads, the building enclosure  
must resist the transfer of heat, air, and moisture \(HAM\). The laws  
of physics dictate that heat always flows from hot to cold. Air  
moves through building enclosures by passing through porous  
materials, or through holes and gaps in nonporous materials,  
based on differential air pressures. Moisture, as water in the liquid  
state \(such as rain, snow, and groundwater\), moves through enclo-  
sures by four methods\: capillary action, surface tension, gravity,  
and kinetic energy \(e.g., wind-driven rain\). Moisture in the vapor  
state moves through enclosures from zones of higher to lower  
vapor pressures, by diffusion through solid materials or by air  
transport through holes.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Control of the flow of HAM across the building enclosure is an  
interrelated problem, in that air movement can create the kinetic  
energy that pulls water through joints, dramatically reduce thermal  
insulation effectiveness, or cause massive vapor transport.  
Improper thermal insulation can cause condensation on uncon-  
trolled surfaces.  
To control HAM, three components must be considered separately\:  
heat, air, and moisture.  
Heat is most commonly controlled by thermal insulation. Keep in  
mind the following\:  
• Air movement around thermal insulation can seriously degrade  
its effectiveness, so avoid systems that ventilate the conditioned  
side of the thermal insulation.  
• Radiant barriers may be effective, particularly in hot climates,  
but they must have an airspace on the warm side. Generally  
speaking, radiant barriers have virtually no insulating value and  
should not replace but, instead, enhance typical thermal insula-  
tion and conductive losses.  
• Thermal short circuits can dramatically reduce the U-value of  
thermal insulation. The most common example is metal studs,  
which may reduce the effective value of thermal insulation  
between the studs by half.  
Air transfer is controlled by a coordinated and continuous system  
of air barriers for all six sides of the enclosure \(i.e., the lowest-  
grade level, foundation walls, exterior walls, and the roof\).  
• Common approaches to wall air barriers are continuous mem-  
branes applied to sheathing and sealed to windows, doors, and  
penetrations.  
• Below-grade assemblies can utilize either the concrete walls  
and slabs or applied waterproofing membranes.  
• Most typical low-slope roof membranes will provide an air bar-  
rier, except for mechanically fastened systems that may not be  
able to resist all of the required loads.  
• It is possible to design the gypsum board as an air barrier, if all  
joints and cracks are sealed.  
• Many air barrier systems require a combination of a membrane  
and a structural panel to resist loading, such as spun-bond  
polyolefin membranes stapled to sheathing or bituminous mem-  
branes adhered to CMU.  
Moisture management consists of controlling moisture entry, mois-  
ture accumulation, and allowing for drying.  
• Perfect barriers to moisture are virtually impossible to achieve,  
therefore it is important that measures taken to keep out mois-  
ture do not also trap moisture—for example, waterproofing  
membranes that trap thermal insulation between a vapor  
retarder.  
• It is essential to maintain a balance of the moisture that is able to  
accumulate in an assembly between drying cycles. Accumulation

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS  
and drying are extremely dependent on the local climate. Some  
materials such as wood-framed walls and masonry have the  
capacity to absorb relatively large quantities of moisture and to  
then later dry out without damage or deterioration. Other sys-  
tems such as gypsum board on metal studs have very little capac-  
ity for storage of moisture.  
• The source of water is primarily rain, which should be limited by  
a reasonably detailed assembly based on the expected amount  
of precipitation. The precipitation map in Figure 11.2 shows  
recommended enclosure types along with the required perfor-  
mance to minimize water entry.  
• Below grade, the primary source of moisture is through capillary  
action that can be controlled through membranes and capillary  
breaks.  
• Sources of vapor may be from the interior or exterior environ-  
ment. Vapor retarders have been the traditional method used to  
control vapor movement, but their use in mixed heating and cool-  
ing climates must be carefully evaluated to allow drying.  
• Moisture control in the solid state \(i.e., ice\) depends on not let-  
ting liquid water freeze; or, if it does, allowing room for expan-  
sion. For example, cold roof surfaces that eliminate thawing also  
prevent ice buildup, and air-entrained concrete provides room  
for ice crystals to expand.  
Figures 11.3 and 11.6 show details of wall assemblies that can be  
used for analysis of drying under various climatic conditions. The  
various assemblies are somewhat independent of the cladding  
type. Other wall assemblies, including face-sealed or massive bar-  
rier assemblies, should receive similar analysis of HAM control.  
Two useful tools for this purpose are\:  
• Computerized modeling of wetting and drying of walls\: This is  
widely available and is very helpful in understanding moisture  
accumulation and drying. Analysis is recommended for large  
projects and any assembly that requires seasonal drying. Mixed  
climates may be the most difficult to predict by rule of thumb or  
empirical analysis. WUFI, developed by the Fraunhofer Institute  
for Building Physics in Germany with a North American version  
developed jointly with Oak Ridge National Laboratory \(www.ornl.  
gov \) is a widely recognized modeling tool. Similar software is  
available through www.virtual-north.com/download/OrderForm.  
pdf and www.architects.org/emplibrary/HAMtoolbox.pdf.  
• Manual analysis of simple two-dimensional diagrams of wall  
sections\: This involves using temperature gradients plotted  
against dew point temperature or vapor-pressure gradients  
plotted against saturation pressure. For instructions refer to  
“Design Tools,” by Anton TenWolde \(Chapter 11 in the manual  
Moisture Control in Buildings \[MNL18\], Heinz R. Trechsel, edi-  
tor, published by ASTM, 1994\).  
• Thermal insulation must be continuous to prevent the vapor  
retarder from reaching the dew point.  
• Masonry veneer over CMU or metal stud backup systems is an  
excellent choice.  
• If metal stud backup systems are used, do not place thermal  
insulation between the studs.  
• Any paint or wall covering is allowed on the interior finish.  
• Materials should be progressively more permeable, because  
they are located closer to the exterior face.  
• Any paint or wall covering is allowed on the interior finish.  
• A mechanical system is not required to dry the interior air.  
• Failure of the building paper may allow moisture accumulation  
that cannot be overcome by drying.  
• Elements penetrating thermal insulation \(such as beams support-  
ing a projecting canopy or the sump pan of roof drains\) can cause  
condensation problems, unless they are insulated with closed-  
cell thermal insulation or a thermal insulation with a vapor  
retarder to keep moisture-laden air from getting to these sur-  
faces. This is particularly true for occupancies with high humidity  
\(including residences, hospitals, museums, swimming pools\).  
• The mechanical system must provide dehumidification of the  
interior air for drying.  
• Avoid any vapor-impermeable interior finishes \(e.g., a vinyl wall  
covering that will trap moisture\).  
• A radiant barrier may be incorporated into the cavity.  
• Taped joints in sheathing, board insulation, or a combination  
may provide an air barrier.  
• An air barrier is crucial to limit moisture transport through  
imperfections in the vapor retarder.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
• Refer to specific details for each material for more information  
regarding selection criteria and proper detailing.  
• Include only one vapor retarder in a wall assembly, and ensure  
that all other materials are increasingly permeable from the  
vapor retarder out.  
• It is acceptable \(and sometimes desirable\) to provide more than  
one air barrier in a wall assembly.  
• It is generally desirable to protect blanket insulation from air-  
washing with an air barrier on the cold side.  
• All materials must be relatively vapor-permeable to allow drying  
in both directions, because seasons change direction of heat  
flow and vapor drive.  
• Detail system with interior and exterior side-permeable air bar-  
riers to limit moisture transport and infiltration/exfiltration.  
• May be possible to use board insulation with taped joints as  
sheathing, which will form a vapor retarder if board and blanket  
insulation have approximately the same U-value.  
• Secure a highly reliable enclosure system to control HAM in all  
climate zones, without relying on building mechanical systems to  
dry interior air.  
• Thermal insulation located outside of the structure and wall  
framing allows easy installation of continuous air barriers and  
vapor retarders.  
Walls and other surfaces on or around buildings respond to ambient  
temperature change, solar radiation, wetting and drying effects  
from precipitation, and varying cloud cover by either increasing or  
decreasing in volume and therefore in linear dimension. The dimen-  
sional change of a material causes a change in the width of a sealant  
joint opening, producing movement in a sealant. Thermal movement  
is usually the predominate effect causing dimensional change.  
Thermal movement may need to be evaluated at different stages in  
a building’s life; for example, expected temperature differentials  
may need to be considered for the building when it is\: \(1\) under  
construction, \(2\) unoccupied and unconditioned, and \(3\) occupied  
and conditioned. Each of these stages will have different building  
interior environmental conditions, and depending on the building  
enclosure material or system being analyzed for movement, one of  
those stages may produce the maximum expected thermal move-  
ment. ASTM Guide C 1472 provides procedures to assist a joint  
designer in determining material or system minimum winter and  
maximum summer surface temperatures as well as information to  
assist in establishing joint opening installation temperature effects.  
11.3–11.6 Provide an air barrier in the assembly at one or more of the  
locations noted by properly detailing either the inner layer of gypsum  
board, the sheathing layer, or the permeable weather barrier. The  
inner gypsum board can be made an air barrier by sealing the perim-  
eter, penetrations, and transitions to adjacent air barrier assemblies.  
The sheathing can be made an air barrier through similar means of  
sealing all joints, penetrations, and transitions. Using a membrane  
over the sheathering \(either fluid-applied or sheet material\) that is  
vapor permeable, weather-resistant, anmd airtight is extremely effec-  
tive for providing an air barries with the added benefits of simple  
installation and inspection.

The industry standard is a 4\:1 joint design factor, which accom-  
modates thermal movement only, for most sealants. This design  
ratio reflects an absolute minimum. Construction, fabrication, and  
erection tolerances must be added to calculate the nominal joint  
size. The 4\:1 joint design factor can be explained as follows\:  
Anticipated movement of joint\: 1/8 in.  
Apply the 4\:1 joint design factor\: 4 × 1/8 in. = 1/2-in. joint  
The maximum allowable joint size will vary depending on the seal-  
ant being applied. The minimum allowable caulking joint size con-  
figuration is set at 1/4 in. by 1/4 in. These dimensions are the limit  
in order to allow for adequate cleaning, priming, and application of  
the sealant in a dynamically moving joint.  
The depth of the sealant should never exceed the width. If this is  
ignored the sealant will not be able to perform properly and with-  
stand movement. A standard recommendation for joint width to  
depth is a ratio of 2\:1. However, the depth of the sealant should be  
no more than a 1/2 in. to 5/8 in. for most standard caulking joints.  
The following details illustrate the basic typical joints.  
• Butt joint\: Butt joints are the typical joint found in construction.  
They can be expansion joints in walls, floors, and floor perimeters.  
• Fillet or angle joint\: Fillet or angle joints are typically construct-  
ed where two substrates meet at a 90-degree angle. Applications  
around window and door perimeters are typical angle joints. If  
adequate space is not available to insert a backer rod, bond  
breaker tape is required to allow movement of the sealant. A  
1/4-in. minimum sealant depth and a 3/8-in. sealant/surface  
contact are required.  
• Lap joint\: To seal metal to metal joinery, lap joints are usually  
constructed.  
Expansion joint covers that will respond to differential movement,  
both laterally and horizontally, should be provided at joints in  
structure, located where seismic action may be expected or where  
differential settlement is anticipated.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS  
A large selection of prefabricated assemblies to cover interior  
expansion joints is available. Fire-rated barrier-type inserts are  
available and applicable to most assemblies.  
Expansion joints in the exterior enclosure need to be covered in a  
manner that allows for the anticipated movement and to ensure it  
remains weather tight. Continuity of the expansion joint cover from  
foundation up walls and across soffits, ledges, and other offsets up  
to the roofing expansion joint is crucial.  
When expansion joints occur within pressure equalized rainscreen  
walls and drained cavity walls, both the outer layer and the inner  
air/vapor barrier must both be sealed. The outer layer is typically  
sealed with systems listed previously. The air/vapor barrier is  
generally sealed with a fold of flexible membrane; or an elastic  
bellows is commonly used for roofing expansion joints.  
Types of exterior expansion joint covers include\:  
• Metal-framed joint covers\: These are typically available with  
extruded aluminum, stainless steel, and brass or bronze frames,  
which retain a thermoplastic diaphragm. The diaphragm is avail-  
able in a variety of colors, and joints are typically heat-welded in  
the field. These joint systems often come with a secondary inner  
seal. Widths between 2 and 12 in. are common. The diaphragm  
is available in lengths up to 50 ft., which are effective on tall,  
uninterrupted walls.  
• Gland-type joint covers\: These are thermoplastic glands of fold-  
ed or multicelled cross section, typically with molded-in wings  
for grouting into a blockout \(i.e., tee joint\). These systems are  
most commonly used in parking garages and other horizontal  
surfaces.  
• Faced precompressed foam\: The same product listed for use as  
a sealant can be used for expansion joints. The faced materials  
are typically used to provide a finished appearance. These sys-  
tems are relatively easy to install and to make complicated  
transitions, corners, and turns.  
• Sheet metal\: Sheet metal \(preferably interlocking, but possibly  
just overlapping\) can be used to form an expansion joint cover if  
a backup layer is provided. These may be preferred in metal  
panel systems or within a curtain wall.

The building shell should be a major part of the sustainable strat-  
egy. At a minimum, the shell should\:  
• Contribute to minimizing energy use.  
• Incorporate environmentally sensitive materials.  
• Ensure good indoor air quality and occupant comfort.  
• Be durable.  
For high-performance building projects, the enclosure could help  
generate energy, return nutrients to the environment, and filter  
pollutants.  
One area of special concern for the building shell is durability. The  
building superstructure and enclosure are frequently portions of  
the building that should last the longest and are the most difficult to  
repair or replace. Buildings that perform well for many years slow  
or reduce the consumption of resources and the waste stream.  
Failures of the enclosure can lead not only to water-damaged  
materials needing repair or replacement but also to unnecessary  
long-term energy consumption, toxic mold, and sick buildings.  
Buildings are major consumers of energy, so the enclosures should  
be part of a strategy to reduce energy consumption. In fact, creat-  
ing a well-performing enclosure is considered to be the first step  
in reducing energy use, ahead of other more sophisticated strate-  
gies, such as high-performance mechanical systems. A thorough  
understanding of the interior and exterior environments is para-  
mount. For residential buildings in cold climates, heat loss through  
the enclosure may be the largest component of total energy  
consumption. For large commercial buildings in a moderate envi-  
ronment, daylighting schemes may save more energy, even as they  
may result in an enclosure with lower thermal resistance.  
Most jurisdictions require compliance with an energy conservation  
code. ASHRAE 90.1 and the International Energy Conservation  
Code \(in various editions\) are common model codes. These are  
minimum standards and should be exceeded if possible.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL SUPERSTRUCTURE  
# SUPERSTRUCTURE  
Thermal\: Daily and seasonal temperature cycles can cause signifi-  
cant changes in structural shape and member stresses, and may  
lead to fatigue failure.  
Freeze/thaw cycles or corrosive atmosphere\: Evaluate long-term  
effects on structural performance, particularly for exposed  
concrete structures.  
Examples of long-span structures shown in Figure 11.21 are rated  
for their capability to address the following design factor conditions.  
Uneven or excessive snow and ice loads\: Geometry, equipment, or  
surrounding structure may contribute to snow drifting or ice buildup.  
Ponding\: Provide positive drainage to remove water from the  
structure when roof drains clog.  
Wind\: Evaluate potential of wind-induced destructive vibration in  
members or connections.  
Load paths\: Two or more load paths for all loads should be pro-  
vided wherever possible. The greater the area a single member  
supports, the greater should be its safety factor.  
Compression failure\: Resistance to lateral buckling of long mem-  
bers is crucial. Use members that ensure initial and verifiable  
alignment.  
Tension failure\: Dynamic stability under wind or other vibration  
loading should be carefully verified.  
Deflection\: Changes in orientation of members at joints can  
increase destructive stresses from loads.  
Member interaction\: Load flows through structures in such a way  
as to minimize strength. Check all possible load paths of com-  
plex geometric structures.  
Nonstructural connections\: Assemblies attached to a structure will  
influence structural load flow and even become part of the load  
flow if the attachment changes the deflected shape.  
Scale\: Most members have a span limit, beyond which weight of  
the member itself becomes a limiting factor.  
Stress concentration\: Check stresses at changes of cross sections,  
holes, and connections. High-strength materials are particularly  
sensitive.

Erection alignment\: True member length and spatial position are  
crucial for proper alignment and load flow.  
Creep\: Length changes over time will influence both primary and  
secondary stresses.  
Supports and foundations\: Supports must accept movements due  
to deflections from primary and secondary stresses and differ-  
ential foundation settlement.  
Site observation\: Only when the structure is properly established  
in space should it be accepted. Changes in construction materi-  
als or methods should be carefully evaluated.  
Structural building maintenance\: Conditions and alignment of vari-  
ous members, especially crucial nonredundant members, should  
be verified on a regular schedule. Consider using equipment to  
detect excessive deflection.  
Nonstructural building maintenance\: The condition of building  
components should not adversely affect the structure \(e.g., keep  
roof drains open, prevent excessive equipment vibration, and  
maintain expansion joints\).  
Design\: Engineering design must not be compromised by time,  
scheduling, design changes, or building codes.  
Methods\: Construction methods should be selected carefully to  
safely and accurately locate the structural components.

Live load is the weight superimposed by the use and occupancy of  
the building or other structure, not including environmental loads  
such as wind, snow, rain, flood, and seismic loads. The live loads to  
be assumed in the design of buildings and other structures will be  
the greatest loads that probably will be produced by the intended  
use or occupancy; but in no case will they be less than the minimum  
uniformly distributed unit load.  
In general, design live loads should not be in excess of 100 psf on  
any member, supporting an area of 150 sq. ft. or more, except for  
places of public assembly, storage, repair garages, parking struc-  
tures, and roofs. The reduction must not exceed the value of R,  
from the following formulas\:  
R = 0.08 \(A−150\)  
R = 23 \(1+D/L\)  
where the following is true\:  
R = reduction \(%\)  
D = dead load per square foot of area supported by the  
member  
L = live load per square foot of area supported by the  
member  
A = area supported by the member  
In no case should the reduction exceed 60 percent for vertical  
members, or 40 percent for horizontal members.  
For live loads in excess of 100 psf, some codes allow a live load  
reduction of 20 percent for columns only.  
For specific uniformly distributed live loads, movable partition load,  
special and concentrated load requirements, refer to the applica-  
ble building code.  
In addition to specific code requirements, the designer must con-  
sider the effects of special loading conditions such as moving  
loads, construction loads, rooftop planting loads, and concentrated  
loads from supported or hanging equipment \(radiology, computer,  
heavy filing, or mechanical equipment\).  
The live loads given in Figure 11.25 are obtained by reference to  
ICC.  
Floors must be designed to safely support the uniformly distribut-  
ed live load, or the concentrated load in pounds given, whichever  
produces the greater stresses. Unless otherwise specified, the  
indicated concentration is assumed to occupy an area of 2–1/2 ft.  
by 2–1/2 ft. \(6.26 sq. ft.\) and be located so as to produce the  
maximum load effects in the structural members.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL SUPERSTRUCTURE  
The information presented here is intended only as a preliminary  
design guide. All structural dimensions for slab thickness, beam  
and joint sizes, column sizes, should be calculated and analyzed for  
each project condition by a licensed professional engineer.  
Spans shown in the accompanying figures are approximate and are  
based on use of mild reinforcing steel. For spans greater than  
40 ft., consider post-tensioning.  
Consider embedded items such as conduits and penetrations for  
ducts and pipes when coordinating a structural system. Concrete  
floor construction may have less flexibility for locating large duct  
openings close to beam lines or small penetrations immediately  
adjacent to columns.

Two-way slab Similar to joist slab; joists must be  
designed as beams; forms may require  
special order  
Formwork costs more and uses more  
concrete and steel than a joist slab.  
Beams interfere with mechanical services;  
more expensive forms than flat plate.  
Same as for one-way beams, only more so Long span in two directions; small  
deflection; can carry concentrated loads  
Same as for joist slabs, especially for longer  
fire ratings  
Prominent buildings with exposed ceiling  
structure; same types as are suitable for flat  
slab, but with longer spans  
Parking garages, especially with  
post-tensioning  
Portions of buildings in which two-way beam  
framing is needed for other reasons; industrial  
buildings with heavy concentrated loads  
A flat plate is best for moderate spans because it is the most  
economical floor system and has the lowest structural  
thickness. Avoid penetrations for piping and ductwork through  
the slab near the columns. Spandrel beams may be necessary.  
Flat slabs are most commonly used today for buildings  
supporting very heavy loads. When live load exceeds 150 lb.  
per sq. ft., this scheme is by far the most economical.  
A banded slab has most of the advantages of a flat plate, but  
permits a longer span in one direction. It can resist greater  
lateral loads in the direction of the beams.  
This is the best scheme if slabs are too long for a flat plate and  
the structure is not exposed. The slab thickness between joints  
is determined by fire requirements. Joists are most economical  
if beams are the same depth as the joists. Orient joists in the  
same direction throughout the building and in the long direction  
of long rectangular bays.  
Ensure the availability of formwork before specifying skip  
joists. For larger projects, a skip joist slab should be less  
expensive than a joist slab, and it permits lights and equipment  
recessed between joists.  
Column spacing should be multiples of span spacing to ensure  
uniformity of drop panels at each column. Drop panels can be  
diamond-shaped, square, or rectangular.  
This scheme is most favored for parking garages, but the long  
span of about 60 ft. must be post-tensioned, unless beams are  
quite deep. Shallow beams will deflect excessively.  
The high cost of the formwork and structural interference with  
mechanical systems make this scheme unattractive, unless  
heavy concentrated loads must be carried.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL SUPERSTRUCTURE  
Concrete by itself is inherently strong in tension and weak in com-  
pression. There are two procedures used for placing concrete in  
compression. Prestressing of the reinforcing steel occurs prior to  
placement of concrete and is used almost exclusively with precast  
concrete. Post-tensioning is the permanent tensioning of reinforc-  
ing steel for cast-in-place concrete.  
• Concrete strength is usually 5000 psi at 28 days, and at least  
3000 psi at the time of post-tensioning. Use hard-rock aggregate  
or lightweight concrete. Low-slump-controlled mix concrete is  
required to reduce shrinkage. Concrete shrinkage after post-  
tensioning decreases strength gains.  
• Post-tensioning systems can be divided into three categories  
depending on whether the tendon is wire , strand , or bar . Wire  
systems use 0.25-in. diameter wires that have a minimum  
strength of 240,000 psi, and are usually cut to length in the shop.  
Strand systems use tendons \(made of seven wires wrapped  
together\) that have a minimum strength of 270,000 psi, and are  
cut in the field. Bar systems use bars ranging from 5/8- to 13/8-  
in. diameter, with a minimum strength of 145,000 psi, and may  
be smooth or deformed. The system used determines the type of  
anchorage used, which in turn affects the size of blockout  
required \(in the edge of slab or beam\) for the anchorage to be  
recessed.  
• Grease and wrap tendons, or place in conduits, to reduce fric-  
tional losses during stressing operations. Limit the length of  
continuous tendons to about 10 ft. if stressed from one end.  
Long tendons require simultaneous stressing from both ends to  
reduce friction loss. Tendons may be grouted after stressing, or  
left unbonded. Bonded tendons have structural advantages that  
are more important for beams and primary structural members.  
• Minimum average post-tensioning \(net force per area of con-  
crete\) equals 150 to 250 psi for flat plates and 200 to 500 psi for  
beams. Exceeding these values by much causes excessive post-  
tension loss because of creep.  
• Field inspection of post-tensioned concrete is critical to ensure  
proper size and location of tendons, and to monitor the tendon  
stress. Check tendon stress by measuring the elongation of the  
tendon and by monitoring gauge pressures on the stressing jack.  
• Make provisions for the shortening of post-tensioned beams and  
slabs caused by elastic compression, shrinkage, and creep.  
After the post-tensioning is complete, build shear walls, curtain  
walls, or other stiff elements that adjoin post-tensioned mem-  
bers and isolate them with an expansion joint. Otherwise, addi-  
tional post-tensioning force will be required to overcome the  
stiffness of the walls and prevent cracking.  
• Fire tests have been conducted on prestressed beam and slab  
assemblies according to ASTM E119, “Standard Test Methods  
for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Material” test proce-  
dures. They compare favorably with reinforced cast-in-place  
concrete. There is little difference between beams using grouted  
tendons and those using ungrouted tendons.  
Consult the following references\:  
• Post-Tensioning Institute, “Post-Tensioning Manual”  
• Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute, “PCI Design  
Handbook—Precast and Prestressed Concrete”  
• “Design of Prestressed Concrete Structures,” 1981, T.Y. Lin and  
Ned H. Burns, Wiley  
• American Concrete Institute, “Building Code Requirements for  
Structural Concrete and Commentary” \(ACI-318\)  
When working with a prestressed or post-tensioned beam, keep  
the following in mind\:  
• Prestressing force compresses the entire cross section of the  
beam, thereby reducing unwanted tension cracks.  
• Permanent tension is introduced into the tendon and “locked in”  
with the stressing anchorage in one of two ways, though the  
principle in both cases is the same. In prestressed concrete, the  
tendon is elongated in a stressing bed before the concrete is  
poured. In post-tensioned concrete, the tendon is elongated  
after concrete has been poured and allowed to cure by means of  
hydraulic jacks pushing against the beam itself. Post-tensioned  
beams permit casting at the site for members too large or heavy  
for transporting from the factory to the site.  
• Internal vertical forces within the beam are created by applying  
tension on the tendon, making the tendon begin to “straighten  
out.” The tension reduces downward beam deflection and allows  
for shallower beams and longer spans than in conventionally  
reinforced beams.  
• Auxiliary reinforcing steel provides additional strength and  
controls cracking and produces more ductile behavior.  
• Use stirrups to provide additional shear strength in the beam and  
to support the tendons and longitudinal reinforcing steel. Stirrups  
should be open at the top to allow the reinforcing to be placed  
before the tendon is installed. After the tendons are placed,  
“hairpins” that close the stirrups may be used, when required.  
Precast concrete frame systems are ideal for highly repetitive  
structural frames such as parking garages and hotel/apartment/  
dormitory buildings. Precast members can be precast structural  
concrete or precast architectural concrete in exposed locations.  
Detailing of connections for both aesthetics and to protect embedded  
steel members from corrosion is crucial. Typically, welded or bolted  
connections are grouted after final adjustment and anchorage.  
Shear walls in both directions are the most common method to  
resist lateral loads. Stair/elevator cores and dwelling unit separa-  
tion may also serve as shear walls.

Normal weight \(150 pcf\) or lightweight concrete \(115 pcf\) is used  
in standard precast concrete slab construction. Concrete topping is  
usually normal-weight concrete with a cylinder strength of 3000  
psi. All units are prestressed with strand release once concrete  
strength is 3500 psi. Strands are available in various sizes,  
strengths, and placements, according to individual manufacturers.  
Camber varies substantially depending on slab design, span, and  
loading. Nonstructural components attached to members may be  
affected by camber variations. Calculations of topping quantities  
should recognize camber variations. Safe superimposed surface  
loads include a dead load of 10 psf for untopped concrete and 15  
psf for topped concrete. The remainder is live load.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL SUPERSTRUCTURE  
A moment-resisting frame’s lateral stability and resistance to wind  
and seismic forces depend on a fixed connection of beams and  
columns. A moment-resisting connection is achieved when the top  
and bottom flanges of each beam are welded to the flanges of the  
connecting columns with full-depth welds. By directly welding the  
beam web to the column flange, the beam’s horizontal reaction to  
wind forces is transferred to the column. \(A connection using web  
angles and high-strength bolts is also permitted.\) The building’s  
floors are designed to act as diaphragms that connect all of the  
columns and beams, enabling the building to react as a unit.  
• Horizontal loads from wind and seismic events must be resisted,  
typically by diagonal bracing, moment connections, or shear  
walls.  
• Moment frames allow maximum floor plan flexibility, but typi-  
cally increase weight and cost of the structural steel framing.  
• Braced frames are cost-effective, but disrupt the floor plan if not  
carefully located around typical core elements such as stairs,  
shafts, and toilet rooms. Bracing typically is provided by angles  
or W-shapes, as well as hollow structural shapes. Rods and  
cables may be used for architectural expression.  
• Shear walls, typically around shafts for stairs, ducts, and eleva-  
tors, can be an effective lateral load design option. Shear walls  
can be constructed of steel plate, concrete, or reinforced CMU.  
Minimize openings in shear walls for doors and services.  
• It may be effective to mix different lateral restraint methods.  
For a long, narrow building, bracing in the short direction with  
moment frames in the long direction may be effective.  
• The floor or roof deck typically is designed to act as a diaphragm  
to transmit loads to the lateral restraint elements. Structures  
without a deck capable of transmitting loads \(such as bar grat-  
ing or metal roofing\) may require diagonal bracing in the floor or  
roof framing.  
• Open-web steel joists may be used within a main frame of struc-  
tural steel for economy.  
For more information, refer to the AISC Manual of Steel  
Construction.  
Moment-resisting frames are uneconomical in tall steel buildings  
because the larger lateral forces in such structures can be handled  
more efficiently by compression and tension diagonal members, as  
found in braced frames. To save costs, often the upper stories of a  
braced-frame building use moment-resisting beam-column connec-  
tions to resist wind loads.  
The characteristics and principles to keep in mind when working  
with architecturally exposed structural steel \(AESS\) include the  
following\:  
• AESS is structural steel superstructure, supporting all or por-  
tions of a building, which is left exposed in the finished work.  
Through layout and detailing, AESS is meant to contribute to the  
architectural expression.  
• The challenge to successful use of AESS is to clearly specify and  
detail the level of quality required, which is substantially beyond  
the requirements for normal structural steel. Primary areas of  
concern are the quality of finish of the individual members, the  
quality of the methods of joining members together \(particularly  
of welds\), and the tolerances of the finished work.  
• AESS frequently incorporates a variety of tension members  
fabricated of stainless steel and proprietary fittings.  
• AESS may need special fire protection, such as intumescent  
coating or deluge sprinkler systems.  
• For economy, it is worthwhile to carefully identify which portions  
of the AESS will be viewed in close proximity versus those that  
are farther away. Locate defects, welds, and connections on the  
side of assembly away from view, for economy.  
Refer to the “AESS Supplement” to Modern Steel Construction  
\(May 2003\), for an explanation of how to specify AESS.  
In the braced core system, walls around elevator shafts and stair-  
wells are designed to act as vertical trusses that cantilever up from  
the foundation. The chords of each truss are building columns; the  
floor beams act as ties. Diagonals placed in a K-pattern \(occasion-  
ally, in an X-pattern\) complete the truss. A system employing knee  
braces is used in seismic areas because of its greater capability to  
dissipate earthquake energy.  
Braced-core systems can be used efficiently in single-story build-  
ings, as well as in buildings over 50 stories.  
Following are characteristics and principles to keep in mind when  
working with structural steel framing\:  
• High strength of steel provides for economical construction of  
relatively large structural bays.  
• Major framing elements are typically W-shaped sections, or  
round, square, and rectangular hollow structural sections.  
Angles or channels may be used for architectural expression.  
• Building codes require protection of the steel from fire, except  
for small or low-rise structures in some low-hazard occupancies.

Design consideration of steel joist floor framing should include\:  
• Ceilings\: Ceiling supports can be suspended from or mounted  
directly to the bottom chords of joists. Suspended systems are  
recommended, because of dimensional variations in actual joist  
depths.  
11.50\. a. Knee bracing introduces bending into columns and beams and  
may increase their size, but allows for larger openings.  
b. Cross or diagonal bracing is very efficient but limits opening location  
and size.

• Floor construction\: Joists are usually covered by 2–1/2 to 3 in.  
of concrete on steel decking. Concrete thickness may be  
increased to accommodate electrical conduit or electrical/com-  
munications raceways. Precast concrete, gypsum planks, or  
plywood can also be used for the floor system.  
• Vibration\: Objectionable vibrations can occur in open web joist  
and 2–1/2-in. concrete slab designs for open floor areas at  
spans between 20 and 40 ft., in particular at 28 ft. When a floor  
area cannot have partitions, objectionable vibrations can be  
prevented or reduced by increasing slab thickness or modifying  
the joist span. Attention should also be given to sup-  
port for framing beams, which can magnify a vibra-  
tion problem when unsupported.  
• Openings in floor or roof systems\: Small openings between  
joists are framed with angles or channels supported on the  
adjoining two joists. Larger openings necessitating interruption  
of joists are framed with steel angle or channel headers.  
• Adaptability\: It is more difficult to alter joists, add openings, or  
change loading than with structural steel framing.  
• Fireproofing\: Applying fireproofing to joists is more difficult and  
expensive than to structural steel.

Cold-formed steel \(CFS\) floor framing uses C-shaped members that  
are cold-rolled from a steel sheet. CFS framing is laid out similar to  
traditional wood joist floor framing. Finishes may be hot-dipped-  
galvanized coating or shop primed. Fastening is typically self-drilling,  
self-tapping screws, or welded.  
Final engineering of CFS framing is commonly provided by a struc-  
tural engineer hired by the installing contractor, based on a per-  
formance specification prepared by the architect and project  
structural engineer. This delivery method, known as delegated  
design, allows an optimization of the design of the CFS system.  
CFS framing characteristics vary by manufacturer. Based on pre-  
liminary investigation and other project design requirements, the  
design professional may select certain characteristics of the  
joists, for example depth or minimum spacing. The installer’s  
engineer will then select specific joists that conform to the design  
characteristics that also meet the structural performance criteria,  
including yield strength \(33 or 50 ksi\), joist gauge, and flange  
width. CFS rim joists, plates, and other framing may require con-  
tinuous insulation outside of the CFS element, to reduce thermal  
bridging and to comply with energy code.  
11.52 HSS refers to hollow structural section. HSS members can be  
circular, square, or rectangular sections, although other shapes are  
available, such as elliptical. HSS is only composed of structural steel.  
Rectangular and square HSS are also commonly called tube  
steel or structural tubing . Locate HSS seam away from line of sight, or  
grind smooth.

A space frame is a three-dimensional truss with linear members  
that form a series of triangulated polyhedrons. It can be seen as a  
plane of constant depth that can sustain fairly long spans and  
varied configurations of shape.  
Space frames’ prime attributes include\:  
• Light weight  
• Inherent rigidity  
• Wide variety of form, size, and span  
• Compatible interaction with services, primarily HVAC  
Most space frames are designed for specific applications, and a  
structural engineer with specific experience should be consulted.  
Manufacturers can provide the full range of capabilities \(loading,  
spans, shapes, specific details\) for their products. Standardized  
structural assemblies in 4- and 5-ft. modules are available.  
Metal space frames are classified as noncombustible construction,  
and can usually be exposed when 20 ft. above the floor. However,  
a fire suppression or a rated ceiling assembly may be required.  
Consult codes.  
Common finishes include paint, thermoset polyester, galvanized,  
stainless steel, and metal plating.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL SUPERSTRUCTURE  
Lightweight steel framing is cold-formed, which means the compo-  
nents are manufactured by brake forming and punching galvanized  
coil and sheet stock. Cold-formed framing members consist of two  
basic types of components that are C-shaped in section\: one type  
has 1/4-in. flanges folded inward; the other has no flanges. Studs,  
joists, and rafters are made with flanges to stiffen them so they  
will more readily stand vertically. Components without flanges  
\(called tracks \) have unpunched solid webs. For added strength,  
tracks are sized slightly larger than the flanged members so the  
tracks will fit snugly inside them as sill or top plates or as part of  
posts or headers.  
Cold-formed metal framing is strong and versatile. The strength  
and load-carrying capacity of a member can be increased simply by  
increasing the thickness, or gauge, of the metal; the dimensions of  
the member, or the spacing, do not necessarily have to be  
increased. There is little limitation on the length of steel framing  
members; joists or studs may be fabricated in lengths up to 40 ft.  
If handled with care, steel framing is straight and consistent; also,  
it is not affected by moisture content.  
Disadvantages of cold-formed metal framing include lack of insu-  
lating qualities; difficulty in cutting, compared to wood; and dan-  
gerously sharp edges. Consult the American Iron and Steel  
Institute \(AISI\) for further information.

Buildings must be properly braced to resist racking under wind and  
seismic loads. Diagonal strap bracing is sloped to resist forces in  
tension, and fastened by screws or welds to studs and plates.  
Properly spaced lateral steel bracing resists stud rotation and  
minor axis bending under wind, seismic, and axial loads; this is espe-  
cially critical during construction, before sheathing or finishes are  
installed.

is for buildings more than two stories. Steel channel, plate, and anchor  
size depend on applied uplift and horizontal shear forces.

11.71 The number of required rows of bridging is dependent on the  
structural design.

When designing with metal decking, two guidelines are important  
to follow\:  
• When lightweight concrete is used in the construction, use  
galvanized deck material.  
• In a fire-resistant assembly, ensure that metal components are  
unprimed.  
These are some advantages of metal floor decks\:  
• They provide a working platform, eliminating temporary wood  
planking in high-rise use.  
• Composite decks provide positive reinforcement for concrete slabs.  
• Both noncomposite and composite decks serve as forms for  
concrete, eliminating the need for forming and stripping.  
• Acoustic treatment is possible.  
• Electric raceways may be built into the floor slab.  
• Metal floor decking provides economical floor assemblies.

fire-rating requirements.

Cold-formed steel \(CFS\) framing members can be used to frame  
roofs in essentially the same manner as wood rafters or trusses.  
Note that thermal bridging can be a problem in cold climates when  
CFS members are not covered by continuous insulation.  
Similar to cold-formed metal floor joist framing, including the use  
of delegated design, the following characteristics should be con-  
sidered when utilizing CFS for roof framing\:  
• Cold-formed metal roof framing uses C-shaped members, in  
sizes approximating wood framing, with special details for  
sloped bearing conditions.  
• CFS framing is laid out similar to traditional wood joist framing.  
• CFS roof trusses are available in virtually all of the configura-  
tions available for wood trusses.  
• Proprietary roof truss systems use various shapes for chords  
and webs designed to allow higher productivity in fabrication  
and optimization of structural performance. It is generally not  
advisable to design around any single system, but instead to  
provide a general shape that many fabricators can provide.  
• For more information, consult the reference “Product Technical  
Information,” Steel Stud Manufacturers Association; www.  
ssma.com.  
Some of the many types of available metal roof decking include\:  
• Roof decking  
• Composite deck  
• Permanent forms for self-supporting concrete slabs  
• Raceway \(composite or noncomposite\)  
• Acoustic metal decking  
• Acoustic cellular deck \(composite or noncomposite\)  
• Vented roof deck \(used with lightweight insulating concrete fill\)  
Heavy roof-mounted mechanical equipment should not be placed  
directly on a metal roof deck. Equipment on curbs should be sup-  
ported directly on main and supplementary structural members,  
and the deck must be supported along all free edges. Heavy items  
such as cooling towers that must be elevated should be supported  
directly onto structural members below the deck.  
Fire-resistance ratings for roof assemblies are published by Code  
authorities, Underwriters Laboratories, and Factory Mutual. Fire-  
resistance ratings may be achieved by various methods including  
applied fireproofing, rated acoustic ceilings, and gypsum board  
enclosures.  
Metal roof decks must be secured to supports, generally by means  
of welds made through the decking to supporting steel. Steel sheet  
lighter than 22 gauge should be secured by use of welding washers.  
Side laps between adjacent sheets of deck must be secured by  
button-punching standing seams, welding, or screws, in accor-  
dance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.  
Decks used as lateral diaphragms must be welded to steel sup-  
ports around their entire perimeter to ensure development of dia-  
phragm action. More stringent requirements may govern the size  
and/or spacing of attachments to supports and side lap fasteners  
or welds.  
Roof deck selection must consider construction and maintenance  
loads, as well as the capacity to support uniformly distributed live  
loads. Consult the Steel Deck Institute’s recommendations and  
Factory Mutual Global’s requirements.  
There are a number of advantages to using metal roof decks\:  
• A high strength-to-weight ratio reduces roof dead load.  
• They can be erected in most weather conditions.  
• A variety of depths and rib patterns are available.  
• Acoustic treatment is possible.  
• They can serve as the base for insulation and roofing.  
• Fire ratings can be obtained with standard assemblies.  
• They can provide a lateral diaphragm.  
• They can be erected quickly and economically.  
• Using them makes it easy and economical to create roof slopes  
for drainage when mounted over sloped structural steel.

may be cut in a roof or floor deck without reinforcing the deck.  
b. Openings up to 10 in. by 10 in. or 10-in. diameter require reinforcing  
of the deck either by welding a reinforcing plate to the deck all around  
the openings or providing channel-shaped headers and/or supplemen-  
tary reinforcing parallel to the deck span. Reinforcing plates should be  
14-gauge sheets with a minimum projection of 6 in. beyond all sides of  
the opening, and they should be welded to each cell of the deck.  
c. Larger openings should be framed with supplementary steel mem-  
bers so that all free edges of the deck are supported.

the shop to fit the required dimensions.  
Treads and landings may be filled with 1–1⁄2 to 2 in. of concrete.  
Many finish materials can then be applied to the concrete.  
Balusters are anchored by welding, bolting, or screwing to the  
stringers. Glass balusters are often anchored into a special  
U-shaped channel, which is attached to the edge of the stringer. A  
similar detail can be used for glass railings.

11.95 a. Heavy timber beam\: Timber beams are available in a variety of  
species and grades; Douglas fir is the strongest. Heavy timber uses  
rectangular solid-wood framing members that are nominally a minimum  
of 5 in., in both dimensions.  
b. Laminated veneer lumber \(LVL\) beam\: Vertical factory-laminated sec-  
tions are glued together. Actual widths are multiples of 1–3/4 in. \(two  
pieces match thickness of 2 × 4 wall\). Actual heights range from 5–1/2  
to 18 in.  
c. Parallel strand lumber \(PSL\) beam\: Factory-glued composite beam  
made with long narrow strips of veneer, oriented along beam length. Actual  
widths are 3–1/2, 5–1/4, and 7 in. Heights range from 9–1/4 to 18 in.  
d. Glue-laminated beam\: Horizontal factory-glued laminations make a  
knot-free and very stable beam. Actual widths are 3–1/8, 5–1/8, 7–1/8  
in., and so on. Heights are in multiples of 1–1/2 in.  
e. Built-up beam\: Dimension lumber is nailed together to form a single  
beam \(four pieces maximum\). Widths are multiples of 1–1/2 in. Height  
follows dimension lumber.  
f. Flitch beam\: A steel plate sandwiched between two pieces of lumber  
adds strength without substantially increasing the beam size. The lum-  
ber prevents buckling of the steel and provides a nailing surface. Widths  
are 3 to 3–1/2 in. Heights follow dimension lumber.  
g. Box beam\: 2 × 4 lumber is sandwiched between two plywood skins.  
Plywood is both nailed and glued to 2 × 4s and at all edges. Plywood  
joints must be offset.

Before any of the superstructure is erected, the first-floor framing  
and subflooring is put down, making a platform on which the walls  
and partitions can be assembled and tilted into place. Because  
floor framing and wall frames do not interlock, adequate sheathing  
must act as bracing and provide the necessary lateral resistance.  
Where required for additional stiffness or bracing, metal strapping  
or a 1 by 4 may be let into outer face of studs at 45° angles,  
secured at the top, bottom, and to the studs. The process is  
repeated for each story of the building.  
Bridging may be omitted when flooring is nailed adequately to the  
joist. However, where nominal depth-to-thickness ratio of joists  
exceeds 6, bridging would be installed at 8-ft-0-in. intervals.  
Building codes may allow omission of bridging under certain  
conditions. Steel bridging is available. Some types do not require  
nails.  
For firestopping, all concealed spaces in framing, with the excep-  
tion of areas around flues and chimneys, are to be fitted with 2-in.  
blocking arranged to prevent drafts between spaces.  
Platform framing has essentially replaced balloon framing. Balloon  
framing with studs continuous from wood sill to top plate is rarely  
used, except at special locations \(such as two-story spaces, at  
parapets, and similar situations where a structural cantilever of  
the wall is required\).

Steel lintels are selected from steel beam design tables on the  
basis of floor, wall, and roof openings. Wood lintels over openings  
in bearing walls may be engineered as beams. Composite beams,  
such as glued-laminated beams, also are appropriate in some  
applications. Plywood box beams are used for garage doors. Steel  
flitch plates can add strength without adding extra width to a  
composite beam.

11.114 a. Some framing details rely on techniques that reduce the  
amount of lumber in wood construction. Among these are in-line fram-  
ing details and corner details with metal framing clips for gypsum  
board. These types of details were developed to conserve wood  
resources, reduce material cost and job-site waste, and enhance ener-  
gy efficiency by reducing thermal bridging across wall systems and  
increasing insulation cavities. When wood levels are to be reduced, a  
structural engineer should first be consulted.  
b. Gypsum board installed at inside corners with metal clips or wood  
backers does not get fastened to either. The sheet resting against the  
backer or clips is installed first so the second sheet \(which is nailed to  
the stud\) will lock the first sheet in place. The “floating joint” that  
results is recommended, to reduce cracks in the corner.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL SUPERSTRUCTURE  
Heavy timber construction is characterized by large, exposed tim-  
ber columns, beams, and other structural members, joined togeth-  
er by traditional pegged mortise-and-tenon or similar joints. Heavy  
timber uses rectangular solid-wood framing members that are  
nominally a minimum of 5 in., in both dimensions. Heavy timber  
fabricated timber frame modules are called bents. Bents run per-  
pendicular to the ridge, and include the primary columns, beams,  
girders, and rafters, and knee braces. Bents are typically spaced  
10 to 16 ft. on center. Note that alternate framing methods running  
parallel to the ridge, or utilizing systems similar in concept to  
platform framing, are available from some timber framers. Knee  
braces typically provide bracing against lateral loads.  
Heavy timber structures are typically enclosed with stressed-skin  
insulated panels, leaving the frame totally exposed on the interior.  
Heavy timber construction is being updated with modern materi-  
als such as glulam members and proprietary concealed metal  
connections.  
A beveled shoulder or housed joint is used to connect all load-  
bearing beams \(such as bent and connecting girts and summer  
beams\) to posts. Angled variations can be used when principal  
rafters join to posts or for diagonal braces. The depth of the shoul-  
der depends on loading, torsion, other joinery in the area, and  
wood species.  
The basic mortise-and-tenon joint can be very effective in resisting  
both tension and compression forces. To increase tensile strength,  
increase the depth and thickness of the tenon and use additional  
pegs if the width and length of the tenon allow.

Note in simple framing, shown in Figure 11.130, the “positive,” or  
downward, bending that occurs in conventional framing with sim-  
ple spans. Note also in cantilevered framing the combination of  
“positive” \(downward\) and “negative” \(upward\) bending that  
occurs with beams spliced at quarter point, producing supported  
beam and cantilevered beam. The two types of bending counterbal-  
ance each other, which produces more uniform stresses and uses  
material more efficiently.  
Moment splice occurs when compression stress is taken in bearing  
on the wood through a steel compression plate. Tension is taken  
across the splice by means of steel straps and shear plates. Side  
plates and straps are used to hold sides and tops of members in  
position. Shear is taken by shear plates in end grain. Bolts and  
shear plates may be used as design and construction consider-  
ations require.  
Cantilever beam systems may be composed of any of the various  
types and combinations of beams shown in the figures in this section.  
Cantilever systems generally permit longer spans or larger loads per  
size member than do simple span systems.  
For economy, the negative bending moment at the support of a  
cantilevered beam should be equal in magnitude to the positive  
moment.

both horizontal forces and uplift. Moisture barrier is recommended. It

The term glued-laminated construction refers to an engineered,  
stress-rated product made of wood laminations bonded with adhe-  
sives, with the grain approximately parallel lengthwise. Laminated  
pieces can be end-joined to form any length, be glued edge to edge  
to make wider pieces, or be of bent pieces curved during the lami-  
nating process.  
Dimension lumber surfaced to 1–1/2 in. is used to laminate  
straight members and members that have a curvature within the  
bending radius limitations for the species. Boards surfaced to 3/4  
in. are recommended for laminating curved members when the  
bending radius is too short to permit the use of dimension lumber,  
provided that the bending radius limitations for the species are  
observed. Other lamination thicknesses may be used to meet spe-  
cial requirements.

The design of connections for glued-laminated construction is  
similar to the design of connections for dimension lumber. Since  
glued-laminated members often are much larger than dimension  
lumber, and the loads transferred are larger, the effect of  
increased size should be taken into account in the design of con-  
nections. In addition to being designed for strength to transfer  
loads, connections also should be designed to avoid splitting of the  
member, as well as to accommodate swelling and shrinking of the  
wood.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Similar in nature to heavy timber, the self-insulating qualities of  
glued-laminated construction cause the members to burn slowly.  
Good structural details, elimination of concealed spaces, and use  
of vertical fireblocking contribute to its fire-resistance and ability  
to retain its strength longer than unprotected metals.  
Therefore, building codes generally classify glued-laminated con-  
struction as heavy timber construction if certain minimum dimen-  
sional requirements are met. Codes also allow for calculation of  
one-hour fire ratings for exposed glued-laminated members.  
It is not recommended that fire-retardant treatments be applied to  
glued-laminated members because they do not substantially  
increase the fire resistance. In considering fire-retardant treat-  
ments, it is essential to investigate the following\: reduction of  
strength related to type and penetration of treatment, compatibility  
of treatment and adhesive, use of special gluing methods, difficulty  
of application, and effect on wood color and fabrication process.

Guidelines for selecting fasteners include\:  
• Use hot-dipped galvanized fasteners to avoid corrosion and  
staining.  
• Preservative treated wood requires stainless steel fasteners or  
special heavy galvanized coating recommended by the treat-  
ment manufacturer.  
• To reduce board splitting by nailing, do the following\: blunt nail  
points, predrill \(3/4 of nail diameter\), stagger nailing, and place  
nails no closer to the edge than one-half of board thickness.  
• Avoid end-grain nailing and toenailing, if possible.  
• Use flat washers under heads of lag screws and bolts, and  
under nuts.  
In addition, note that hot-dipped galvanized casing nails or stain-  
less steel deck screws are typically the best type of decking fasten-  
ers, and plated ring shank or spiral groove shank nails are suitable  
for arid climates.  
These figures illustrate details of common types of roof framing.  
To protect wood decking from moisture, follow these guidelines\:  
• Protect wood members from weather by preservative wood  
treatment.  
• Treat wood in direct contact with soil or concrete with preservative.  
• Ensure that the bottoms of posts on piers are 6 in. above grade.  
• Sterilize or cover soil with membrane to keep plant growth away  
from wood members, to minimize moisture exchange.  
• Treat ends, cuts, and holes, with preservative before placement.  
• Kerf decking and flat-trim boards, 2 in. by 6 in. and wider, on the  
underside with 3/4-in.-deep saw cuts at 1 in. o.c., to prevent  
cupping.  
• Avoid horizontal exposure of end grain, or provide adequate  
protection by flashing or sealing. Avoid or minimize joint condi-  
tions where moisture may be trapped by using spacers and/or  
flashing, caulking, sealant, or plastic roofing cement.  
On large decks or decks where post heights exceed 5 ft., lateral  
stability should be achieved with horizontal bracing \(metal or wood  
diagonal ties on top or bottom of joists or diagonal application of  
decking\), in combination with vertical bracing \(rigid bolted or gus-  
seted connections at tops of posts, knee bracing, or cross-bracing  
between posts\), and/or connection to a braced building wall.  
Lateral stability should be assessed by a structural engineer.  
Composite decking is composed of various plastics with wood,  
glass, or carbon fibers, as well as other additives. Typically a por-  
tion of the plastic is recycled material. Composite decking may be  
solid, similar to wood, or extruded hollow shapes. Many assem-  
blies are designed to utilize concealed fasteners.  
Composite decking typically is more consistent in appearance and  
more durable than wood, but initially costs more, may not look  
natural, and may become very hot in direct sun.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL SUPERSTRUCTURE  
Shop-fabricated wood trusses have been used in building construc-  
tion since 1953, when the metal connector plate was invented.  
Metal plates are available in a range of styles and tooth orienta-  
tions. The metal plates are punched with barbs that grab onto the  
wood truss, thus reducing the hand-nailing required to fabricate a  
structure. Plate size for a given truss is based on a combination of  
the tooth withdrawal strength of the plate, the tensile and shear  
strength of the steel, and the net sectional area of the lumber.  
This system is primarily used for roofs with either pitched or paral-  
lel chord trusses. It is occasionally employed for floors with paral-  
lel chord trusses. Individual trusses are cut from 2-by-4-in. or  
2-by-6-in. dimension lumber and can be spaced 24 in. or 48 in. o.c.  
For typical residential construction, 24 in. o.c. is used. Exceptionally  
long spans are possible with shop-fabricated wood trusses, allow-  
ing the large, unencumbered interior spaces often required in  
commercial, agricultural, and other nonresidential building types.  
Camber is designed for dead load only\: Camber \(in.\) = Length  
\(ft.\)/60  
Providing adequate bracing for trusses is essential, both during  
installation and as a component of the overall roof design. Truss  
members must be held in place with supports that meet them at  
right angles. Truss chords and web members are placed in a verti-  
cal, plumb position, and maintain that position, resisting applied  
design loads throughout the life of the structure. Permanent brac-  
ing and anchorage are expected to be an integral part of construc-  
tion, and strongbacks are often used for this purpose.  
Movement by crane can damage trusses. Crane spreader bars are  
used to avoid this “out-of-plane” buckling. Special stiffening may  
be applied to trusses during erection.

o.c.; but it varies, up to 4 ft. The average combined dead and live loads  
is 45 lb./sq. ft. Spans are usually between 20 and 32 ft., but can be as

When examining the shapes of structural glued-laminated mem-  
bers, note the following\:  
• Beam names describe top and bottom surfaces of the beam.  
Sloped or pitched surfaces should be used on the tension side of  
the beam.  
• The three-hinged arches and frames shown in Figure 11.171  
produce horizontal reactions requiring horizontal ties or modi-  
fied foundations.  
• The triangulated and the radial arch are the two basic types of  
structural glued-laminated wood dome systems available. Both  
require a tension ring at the dome spring line to convert axial  
thrusts to vertical loads. Consideration must be given to the  
perimeter bond beam design, as wind forces will produce loads in  
this member. The lengths of the main members of the radial arch  
system, which must span a distance greater than half the dome  
diameter, limit the maximum practical dome diameter. The much  
smaller members of the triangulated dome result in the greater  
diameters. The triangulated system can be designed for five or  
more segments, with an equal number of peripheral supports at  
each segment.  
• More complicated shapes may be fabricated. Contact the  
American Institute of Timber Construction \(AITC\) and the  
American Plywood Association \(APA\).

Wood stairs used in private, residential applications usually are not  
governed by the ADA; however, wood stairs in commercial facilities  
and places of public accommodation must conform to the accessi-  
bility guidelines adopted in the local jurisdiction.  
The following are general recommendations; verify specific  
requirements that may vary from  
• A minimum interior stair width of 36 in. should be provided.  
• Minimum headroom is 6 ft-8 in. as measured vertically from a  
diagonal line connecting tread nosings to the underside of the  
finished ceiling or stair landing directly above the stair run.  
• Recommended headroom is 7 ft.  
Only handrails and stair stringers may project into the required  
width of a stair. Use the following guidelines\:  
• The maximum handrail projection is 3–1⁄2 in.  
• The maximum stringer projection is 1–1⁄2 in.  
• The width of a landing or platform should be at least as wide as  
the stair.  
• The maximum vertical rise of a stair between landings is 12.  
• Riser height should be between 4 in. minimum and 7 in. maximum.  
• Tread depth should be 11 in. minimum, measured from riser to  
riser or nosing to nosing.  
• Variation in adjacent treads or risers should not exceed 3⁄16 in.  
The maximum variation allowed in the tread depth or riser  
height within a flight of stairs is 3⁄8 in.  
• Nosings project 1–1⁄2 in. maximum.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL SUPERSTRUCTURE  
Structural building panels are factory-assembled composite panels  
ready for installation as a complete structural and/or insulating  
wall section. The material of each component of the panel system  
is very important when selecting a panel manufacturer. Components  
include the skin, foam core, adhesive, and optional exterior or  
interior finish. The application for which the panel is intended  
determines the materials used. Consult manufacturers for specifi-  
cations.  
Sizes vary from 4-by-8-ft panels weighing about 100 lb., to 8-by-  
28-ft panels that must be installed using a crane.  
Insulating concrete forms \(ICFs\) are basically forms for poured  
concrete walls that stay in place as a permanent part of the wall  
assembly.  
The forms, made of foam insulation, are either formed interlocking  
blocks or separate panels connected with plastic ties. The left-in-  
place forms not only provide a continuous insulation and sound  
barrier, but also a backing for gypsum board on the inside and  
stucco cement plaster, lap siding, or brick on the outside.  
Although all ICFs are identical in principle, the various brands dif-  
fer widely in the details of their shapes, cavities, and component  
parts.  
Block assemblies have the smallest individual units, ranging from  
8 in. × 1 ft-4 in. \(height × length\) to 1 ft-4 in. × 41 in. A typical  
ICF block is 10 in. in overall width, with a 6-in. cavity for the con-  
crete. The units are factory-molded with special interlocking edges  
that allow them to fit together much like plastic children’s blocks.  
Panel systems have the largest units, ranging from roughly 1ft ×  
8 ft. to 4 ft. × 12 ft. Their foam edges are flat, and interconnection  
requires attachment of a separate connector or “tie.” Panels are  
assembled into units before setting in place—either on-site or  
prior to delivery.  
Plank systems are similar to panel systems, but generally use  
smaller faces of foam, ranging in height from 8 in. to 12 in. and in  
width from 4 ft. to 8 ft. The major difference between planks and  
panels is assembly. The foam planks are outfitted with ties as part  
of the setting sequence, rather than being assembled into units.  
Within these broad categories of ICF, individual brands vary in their  
cavity design. “Flat wall” systems yield a continuous thickness of  
concrete, like a conventional poured wall. “Grid wall” systems  
have a waffle pattern where the concrete is thicker at some points  
than others. Post-and-beam systems have widely spaced horizon-  
tal and vertical columns of concrete that are completely encapsu-  
lated in the foam form. Whatever the differences among ICF  
brands, all major ICF systems are engineer designed, code  
accepted, and field proven.  
There are two main types of structural building panels\:  
• Stressed skin panels\: These are manufactured by gluing and  
nailing plywood skins to both sides of a wood frame, resulting in  
a unit that performs like an I-beam. Stressed skin panels are not  
necessarily insulated.  
• Structural foam core panels\: These fall into two groups\: sand-  
wich panels and unfaced panels. Sandwich panels are rigid-foam  
panels faced with two structural-grade skins, usually made of  
oriented-strand board \(OSB\) or plywood. Depending on the  
application and the manufacturer, these foam core panels may  
or may not include framing members within the core. Unfaced  
structural foam core panels look like panels of stick-framing  
with thermal insulation between the members, instead of blan-  
ket insulation. Interior and exterior finishes are applied to these  
panels in the field.  
The skins of structural building panels \(such as I-beam flanges\)  
resist tension and compression, while the wood frame or core  
\(such as an I-beam web\) resists shear and prevents buckling of the  
skins.  
All structural foam core panels are insulated with a core of  
expanded polystyrene \(EPS\), extruded polystyrene, or urethane  
foam, from 3–1/2 to 11–1/4 in. thick. Urethane panels are either  
glued-laminated like polystyrene or foamed in place, either in the  
factory or in the field. Urethane has an R-value of 6 or 7 per inch,  
versus R-5 for extruded polystyrene and R-4 for EPS foam.  
Urethane is about twice as strong in compression as polystyrene,  
and has a perm rating of less than 1, which technically qualifies it  
as a vapor retarder. EPS has a perm rating of from 1 to 3 and may  
require an additional vapor retarder. EPS, however, is inert, non-  
toxic \(if ingested\), and resilient; it doesn’t feed microorganisms  
and is generally cheaper than urethane.  
Consult manufacturers on CFC and formaldehyde content in the  
foam core and skin material because it varies among manufactur-  
ers. Regarding flammability of both foam core types, consult with  
the manufacturer about the individual product.  
Using structural panels generally speeds construction because the  
panels replace three standard steps\: framing, sheathing, and  
insulation. Panel assemblies offer superior energy performance  
compared to a conventional framing. This is largely because the

thermal insulation has higher R-values, there are fewer seams to  
seal, and conductive heat is not lost through air infiltration around  
the framing. Structural building panels also offer good resistance  
to lateral loads.  
These panels can, however, be susceptible to infestation by insects  
such as carpenter ants and termites, which eat through wood and  
tunnel through the insulation material, reducing insulation value  
and even compromising structural integrity. Use of termite shields,  
foam cores treated with insect repellant, and other strategies  
should be considered.  
Structural building panels are components of a relatively new  
building system, therefore it is important to consult code officials  
early to prevent any misunderstandings or delays in the code  
approval process. Also, check with manufacturers to determine  
whether their products have received compliance approval from  
authorities having jurisdiction.  
The seams between the panels are the part of the assembly most  
prone to infiltration and weakness, hence most likely to show the  
results of expansion and contraction. Tight spline connections with  
sealant at all edges \(top, bottom, and sides\) can greatly increase  
thermal efficiency.  
In very cold climates, the seams of the panels should be taped and  
sealed against air infiltration and to prevent condensation and  
rotting inside joints.

Glass floor panels are made from laminated glass, usually heat-  
treated for additional strength. Laminating glass ensures that the  
panel will retain its structural integrity if the glass breaks. Heat-  
strengthened glass is preferable to fully tempered glass, because  
when fully tempered units crack, they lose a higher percentage of  
the structural capacity.  
Other features of glass flooring include\:  
• Five-layer laminations are common.  
• Glass is generally translucent, rather than fully transparent for  
modesty, and because of the slip-resistant surface treatment.  
• The glass panels are typically laid on gaskets over steel or alu-  
minum frames, with traffic-grade silicone joint sealant. Panels  
can be supported on point support systems similar to those used  
for curtain walls.  
• Laminated glass can also be used as a beam or joist to support  
glass floor panels. Joists are supported with gasketed shoes or  
clip angles.  
• The walking surface is made slip-resistant by sandblasting, cast  
texture, fired-on frit, or applied coatings.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
Exterior wall assemblies can be defined in three basic categories\:  
• Barrier assemblies  
• Drainage walls  
• Pressure-equalized walls  
Mass barrier walls rely on thickness of water-resistant materials  
to absorb moisture and then dry when precipitation stops. Typical  
assemblies include\:  
• Cast-in-place concrete  
• Precast concrete  
• Concrete masonry units  
Face-sealed barrier walls rely on a perfect continuous seal at the  
exterior face. Common assemblies include\:  
• Exterior insulation and finish systems \(EIFS\)  
• Windows with a single sealant bead  
Typical internal drainage plane walls include\:  
• Portland cement stucco over lath and a weather barrier  
• Wood or vinyl siding  
• Water-drainage EIFS  
Pressure-equalized \(PE\) rainscreen walls use a drainage cavity,  
with the air pressure in the cavity, similar to the exterior air pres-  
sure. Proper detailing of joints and the PE chamber eliminates the  
migration of water across the cavity. PE rainscreen walls must  
include a weather barrier at the inner face of the cavity, venting,  
and compartmentalization of the cavity.  
Typical pressure-equalized rainscreen walls include\:  
• Some unitized stone or metal panels  
• Many curtain-wall systems  
Through careful detailing, brick veneer and many siding products  
can be made into PE rainscreen assemblies.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Drainage cavity walls resist air and moisture penetration with an  
outer layer, to block the bulk of precipitation, and an inner water  
barrier. At drainage cavity walls, a cavity of 3/4 in. or more is pres-  
ent in front of the drainage plane. If the water barrier is not also  
an air barrier, then another layer of the wall assembly must serve  
as an air barrier.  
Common drainage cavity walls include\:  
• Brick veneer  
• Some metal panels  
Mineral-fiber cement siding can be detailed to function as a drain-  
age cavity wall, usually by adding 1 by 3 vertical furring strips.  
Tilt-up concrete construction is a fast, economical method of  
enclosing a building with durable, load-bearing walls. The wall panel  
units are formed and cast horizontally at the job site, on either the  
building slab floor or a temporary casting slab. The panels do not  
have to be transported, so there are fewer restrictions on panel  
size. Wood formwork is typically used to define the edges, reveals,  
details, and openings in the panel. Once the concrete has reached  
sufficient strength, the panels are lifted \(or tilted up\) by crane and  
placed on isolated or continuous foundations \(usually grade  
beams\). The panels are braced against the floor slab or a brace  
foundation until they are tied to the roof and floor system, and then  
become an integral part of the completed structure. Although ini-  
tially restricted primarily to single-story construction, tilt-up tech-  
nology can now be used for buildings nearly 100-ft in height. Tilt-up  
load-bearing walls can be erected up to seven stories.

Panel thickness varies from 6 to 14 in., depending on height, loads,  
span, depth of reveals, surface finish, local codes, and construction  
practices. Full-height panel widths of 20 ft. and weights of 30,000  
to 50,000 lb. are typical. Spans of 30 ft. are common for spandrel  
panels, as are cantilevers of 10 to 15 ft. Panels are designed struc-  
turally to resist lifting stresses, which frequently exceed in-place  
loads. A structural engineer designs the structural load-bearing  
envelope and slab with load transfer to typical foundation of either  
continuous footings or piers.  
Panels can be cast either face-down or face-up, depending on  
desired finish and formwork methods. The face-down method,  
however, is usually easier to erect. Casting method, desired finish,  
and available aggregates affect concrete mix design. Control of the  
concrete mix design and placement of the concrete in the forms  
are more difficult than with factory-cast units. Discoloration occurs  
if cracks and joints in the castings are not sealed. Tilt-up can repli-  
cate or incorporate a great variety of finishes using a variety of  
form liners, embedded materials, applied or cast-in colors, and  
various measures of abrasion, for the desired aesthetics.  
Tilt-up offers the broadest variety of thermal enveloped design and  
performance. Configured with high-strength, reinforced concrete,  
the panels are rated air barriers and when combined, the vertical  
joint treatments as well as caulking at openings, the wall system is  
easily maintained to current code requirements. Insulation sys-  
tems are available for designer options for interior and exterior as  
well as the assembly known as sandwich panel, which is continu-  
ous insulation held between two layers of concrete panel.  
The proceeding illustrations show four details of common roof  
terminations to tilt-up panels. Attachment of steel trusses and  
other common roof members to the panel is accomplished through  
four primary options\:  
Vertically supported along the panel top  
Vertically supported at void-form pockets or ledges  
Vertically supported at seat angles or shoes  
Vertically supported at integrally cast ledges or pilasters  
These bearing mechanisms allow the tilt-up panels to carry virtu-  
ally any roof type, from wood joist/deck to heavy timber, from  
precast plank to cast-in-place deck, and from steel brace to stan-  
dard steel joist/deck. Regardless of the type of roof structure, the  
connections to the tilt-up panel can be designed to accommodate  
the loads and required connection points. Aligning embedded  
plates or pocket-forming materials can be completed easily and  
checked for accuracy before any concrete is placed.  
The primary design value for these connections that is consistent  
throughout these roof types and connection designs is the ease  
and simplicity of the erection procedure.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
There is a wide variety of methods used to connect tilt-up panels  
to foundations to ensure the transfer of building loads, including  
shear. Panels can extend below the finished floor elevation \(some-  
times substantially\) to rest on the footing, or the footing height and  
or a foundation wall may be extended upward to meet the panel at  
a higher bearing elevation.  
Whether connecting to the footing or the slab, a combination of  
inserts, reinforcing bars, and angles is often used with welded or  
bolted final constructions. The two proceeding details show differ-  
ent levels of floor slab intersection with the panels, including a  
dock-high elevation.  
In general, the design of this intersection accommodates a balance  
between the ease of erection and the installation costs of the  
foundation system. At all locations, however, the panels initially  
bear on shim stacks and are supported long-term by a fully grouted  
base detail.  
Control of heat flow through the panel is typically accomplished by  
adding insulation to the interior side \(except insulated sandwich  
panels\). The insulation is best installed immediately adjacent to the  
inside face of the panel using board insulation installed with adhe-  
sive, stickpins, or Z-shaped furring channels. Because the insulation  
may be exposed to moisture penetrating the concrete, insulation  
should be selected that will withstand occasional moisture.  
Blanket insulation may be used between stud walls erected inside  
of the precast panel, but thermal loss through the studs must be  
accounted for. Effectiveness of the insulation is dependent on close  
contact with the weather barrier, so the interior gypsum board  
should be sealed.  
The precast concrete panels function as a weather barrier. To  
complete the weather barrier assembly, joints and penetrations  
should be double-sealed and allowance made for weepholes.  
Precast concrete wall panels typically perform as mass barrier  
walls. The density and thickness of the concrete controls the pen-  
etration of water. In cold climates, a vapor retarder is typically  
applied over the interior face of the insulation. \(Blanket insulation  
installed in a stud wall will probably need the vapor retarder to be  
sealed around electrical and other types of junction boxes.\)  
However, even with the vapor retarder applied directly to the  
inside face of the insulation that is adhered to the inside panel,  
sealing joints is unlikely at the spandrel beams and columns, mak-  
ing the system less desirable in very cold climates. In hot climates,  
a vapor barrier can be applied to the interior face of the panel  
before adhering the insulation.  
Access to the joints for sealing of the vapor retarder is difficult.  
In mixed climates, it is best to select an insulation that can tolerate  
wetting, provide no vapor retarder, and allow the assembly to dry  
to both the interior and exterior. Precast concrete may not perform  
well in areas of high precipitation or situations with an extreme  
vapor drive.  
Joints between precast concrete panels are very susceptible to  
HAM problems. Therefore, joints should be designed as two-stage  
sealant joints as indicated in Figure 11.212.  
It is important to carefully distinguish between the more special-  
ized architectural wall panel and the structural wall panel that is a  
derivative of floor systems. Work with fabricators early in the  
design process, giving careful attention to manufacturing and joint  
tolerance. Thoroughly examine joint sealants for adhesion and  
expected joint movement between the panels.  
Form liner molds provide a wide variety of smooth and textured  
finishes. Finishes after casting \(but prior to hardening\) include  
exposed aggregate, broom, trowel, screed, float, or stippled. After  
hardening, finishes include acid-etched, sandblasted, honed, pol-  
ished, and hammered rib.  
Glass fiber-reinforced concrete \(GFRC\) is a composite material  
manufactured under controlled conditions and consisting of port-  
land cement, fine aggregate, water, alkali-resistant glass fibers,  
and additives. It can be used for cladding applications, especially  
where weight is a significant factor. GFRC is categorized into two  
primary applications\:  
• Architectural cladding panels are very similar in application,  
strength, and performance to architectural precast concrete  
panels, except for providing a significant reduction in weight.  
• Decorative shapes are generally smaller elements not part of  
the building enclosure.

Select a color range, as complete uniformity cannot be guaranteed.  
White cement offers the best color uniformity, as gray cement is  
subject to color variations even when supplied from one source.  
Pigments require high-quality manufacturing and curing standards.  
Fine aggregate color requires control of the mixture graduation;  
coarse aggregate color provides the best durability and appearance.  
GFRC panels consist of a GFRC skin supported by a structural  
frame, usually constructed of cold-formed steel members or a  
small structural channel, angles, and tubes. The GFRC skin is typi-  
cally sprayed into a mold approximately 1/2 to 3/4 in. thick. After  
spraying, the structural frame backup is suspended over the skin,

The fine aggregate, high cement ratio, and spray application allow  
for a fine level of finish, which is very effective at imitating the  
appearance of limestone and other tight-grained uniform stone. The  
finish and detailing can also produce a very precise and machine-  
like appearance. Other characteristics include the following\:  
• The low weight of the panels makes large overhangs, cornices,  
and other horizontal projections possible.  
• Shipping of the panels is relatively inexpensive if the design  
allows for four to six panels to be shipped on each truckload.  
• Relatively flat panels, articulated with joints, are the most cost-  
effective; but large three-dimensional configurations with  
reveals, returns, and setbacks can be economically produced  
because the lightweight material requires less structural sup-  
port and limited backforming.  
• The skin has relatively large amounts of thermal movement, so  
it is generally broken into multiple segments when more than  
30 ft. long, even when mounted on a longer steel backup frame.  
GFRC panels typically perform as thin barrier walls. The density of  
the thin concrete layer controls the penetration of water. GFRC  
panels may not perform well in areas of high precipitation or situ-  
ations with an extreme vapor drive.  
Joints between GFRC panels are very susceptible to HAM prob-  
lems. As with precast, a double line of joint sealant is preferred, as  
indicated in Figure 11.227. Control of heat flow through the panel  
is typically accomplished by adding insulation between the studs of  
the backup frame. Reduction of effectiveness of the insulation  
because of conductive loss through the studs must be accounted  
for. In cold climates, a vapor retarder is typically applied over the  
interior face of the insulation. Fasteners joining the GFRC members  
may be in an environment that may get moist because of condensa-  
tion. Therefore, stainless steel fasteners and careful touch-up of  
welds is very important.  
The GFRC skin typically functions as a weather barrier. To complete  
the weather barrier assembly, joints and penetrations must also be  
sealed. For additional information, consult the GFRC Handbook , pub-  
lished by the Architectural Precast Association \(www.archprecast  
.org/GFRC\_handbook.htm\).

and anchors are embedded in the wet mix, which must be applied  
while the skin is still green. The anchors are designed to allow for  
a relatively large amount of differential movement between the  
backup and the skin.  
team of record. The characteristics of GFRC differ from architec-  
tural concrete mixes often influencing the final design.  
• The strength of GFRC is typically very high\: 10,000 psi is not  
unusual, which is cost effective because a relatively small amount  
of material is required. The high strength results in a more dense  
material that is necessary to resist water penetration.  
• Aggregates are generally small, 3/8 in. or less. Such small  
aggregate limits some of the surface textures available in archi-  
tectural concrete.  
• Because small amounts of aggregate are required, it is possible  
to carefully control the quality and moisture content. Oven-dried  
aggregate is available, which allows for very precise control of  
the moisture content of the finished mix and, therefore, better  
control over the finished color.  
The GFRC mix is typically designed by the manufacturer’s engi-  
neers in a process called delegated design. The mix is designed to  
comply with the performance requirements indicated by the design  
GFRC can be very similar to architectural precast panels, but the  
manufacturing process, assembly, and inherent qualities of GFRC  
allow for a slightly different design expression.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
Single wythe CMU walls may be either load-bearing or non-load-  
bearing supported by the building frame. CMU walls are subject to  
significant movement from shrinkage caused by initial drying and  
then ongoing movement caused by temperature and moisture  
content variations. Therefore, control joints within the masonry  
must be provided at approximately 30-ft centers, near corners, and  
at changes in the strength of the wall \(e.g., chases, changes of  
thickness, door openings, and window openings\).  
Masonry units for the wall may be structural, though architectural  
units may provide more design options. Architectural units include  
split-faced, scored, integrally colored, ground-faced, and specially  
shaped/sized. Glazed CMU and structural clay tile also may be  
used and are advantageous because they are less absorptive.

Single wythe masonry walls function as mass barrier walls. They  
absorb moisture during precipitation and then dry out. Control of  
heat flow is typically accomplished by adding insulation to the  
interior side or by inserting insulation into the cores of the CMU.  
Board insulation is best installed immediately adjacent to the inside  
face of the panel using stickpins, or Z-shaped furring channels.  
Because the insulation may be exposed to moisture, which pene-  
trates the concrete, the insulation should be capable of withstand-  
ing occasional moisture. Blanket insulation may be used between  
stud walls erected inside of the CMU, but thermal loss through the  
studs must be accounted for, along with the use of a weather bar-  
rier. Insulation inside of the CMU cores can be factory-installed  
foam inserts, foamed-in-place insulation, or poured fill. Note, how-  
ever, that insulation in the cores is less effective because it cannot  
cover the entire area. For both insulation applied to the interior  
face or in the cores, the advantage of the thermal mass of the  
masonry is largely lost because it is outside the thermal envelope.  
CMU is generally too porous to function as a weather barrier;  
therefore, a different layer of the assembly must provide that func-  
tion. A membrane may be applied to the interior surface or plaster  
may be applied to the exterior, or an interior gypsum board layer  
may be detailed as components of the weather barrier.  
Single wythe CMU assemblies are very susceptible to water pen-  
etration. The porous nature of the CMU itself, the large number of  
joints that are only as deep as the thickness of the outer face,  
cracks caused by thermal movement, control joints, and lack of a  
dependable drainage path once moisture penetrates make single  
wythe walls a poor choice in relationship to heat, air, and moisture.  
A variety of proprietary water-repellant additives for both the  
concrete used to manufacture the CMU and in the mortar can help  
reduce water absorption. Flashing systems to provide internal  
drainage of the cores of the CMU at the base are also available,  
and may improve performance. The application of water-repellant  
coatings may help, but will need maintenance coatings over the life  
of the structure.  
Applying a three-coat stucco system over the CMU may help mini-  
mize absorption. Exterior insulation and finish systems \(EIFS\)  
applied over the CMU will help with both minimizing absorption and  
continuity of the insulation layer. Providing a drainage mat and  
weather barrier to the inside face of the CMU can substantially  
improve performance.

Council, a committee of the Boston Society of Architects for the

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
Clay masonry, including brick used in veneer walls, can provide  
some of the most cost-effective, high-performance exterior wall  
assemblies available. The wall may function as a drained cavity  
wall or, possibly, as a pressure-equalized wall, when properly  
detailed and constructed. The brick veneer must be supported by a  
structural backup, most typically CMU, wood studs, or cold-formed  
steel framing, but may also be placed over structural concrete or  
precast concrete.  
Architectural concrete masonry units \(e.g., split-faced, scored,  
integrally colored, ground-faced, and specially shaped/sized\)  
stone, cast stone, or most other masonry units may be substituted  
for the brick, with little or no effect on total performance.  
• CMU\: CMU provides a nearly ideal backup to brick veneer. It  
matches structural stiffness, is resistant to minor wetting, and  
has similar movement characteristics. The veneer is typically  
anchored with loose pintles attached to eyes on crosspieces of  
the horizontal reinforcing.  
• Cold-formed steel framing\: CFS framing should be designed stiff  
enough to limit cracks caused by deflection\: L/600 is minimum,  
but L/720 or L/900 might be appropriate for longer perfor-  
mance. Veneer ties not only must provide structural anchorage  
but must also be able to seal penetrations through the sheath-  
ing.  
• Wood framing\: Wood framing is typically limited to residential  
and very light commercial construction without the benefit of  
structural engineering. Stud framing should be limited to normal  
limits dictated by codes. Sheathing varies widely from plywood,  
OSB, board insulation, wood fiberboard, and gypsum sheathing.  
Ties are normally light-gauge, corrugated galvanized steel tabs  
nailed to the studs.  
Brick veneer walls in commercial construction should always be  
detailed as drained cavity walls; and in high-rise situations or  
where very high performance is required, they may be upgraded to  
pressure-equalized walls. This wall assembly performs very well in  
all climates. The application of the weather barrier and insulation  
outside the backup allows for a continuous application with a  
minimum of breaks or gaps. If CMU backup is used, the mass stays  
within the insulation, providing a thermal reservoir.  
Incorporate the following recommendations\:  
• 2–in. airspace. If airspace is reduced to 1 in., take extra care to  
keep airspace clear of mortar droppings, or add proprietary  
products.

• Functional weeps above every line of through-wall flashing.  
• Through-wall flashing to direct any moisture within the airspace  
to the exterior.  
• A continuous weather barrier applied to the airspace face of the  
backup. Coordinate the membrane into through-wall flashing,  
window frames, and other penetrations.  
• Board insulation installed in the airspace.  
• Movement capability of the veneer and of the structure, while  
maintaining continuity of the weather barrier.  
In cold-formed steel studs, avoid insulation in the stud space,  
unless dictated by economics. If required, evaluate the assembly  
for the proper location of the vapor barrier, the loss of effective-  
ness of the insulation because of thermal bridges through the  
studs, and the location of the air barrier. A water-resistant mem-  
brane must be installed over the sheathing; and if it also performs  
as a weather barrier, it may have to be vapor-permeable.  
In residential wood-framed brick veneer walls, blanket insulation  
is typically installed in the stud space. The sheathing, board insula-  
tion, weather barrier, and detailing must all be carefully considered  
and balanced in relationship to the local climate.  
For pressure-equalized walls, divide the airspace behind the brick  
veneer into zones approximately one story high by 15 or 20 ft.  
wide. Divide the cavity at inside and outside corners approximately  
5 ft. wide, because these are areas of large pressure changes.  
Extra venting at the top of the cavity is required. Ensure cavity is  
divided from roof at parapets.

• Wood grain\: Real wood or printed wood veneer.  
• Speckled\: Stone-look or decorative speckled patterns.  
Panels are used in a drained cavity exterior wall system by mount-  
ing over a suspension system with airspace, a weather barrier, and  
a structural backup \(usually sheathing over studs\). The panels  
come in a wide variety of base materials, sizes, and colors. Most  
manufacturers sell the tiles together with the suspension system  
as a proprietary system.  
Panels are available in a large variety of types. Some are homoge-  
neous through the thickness, while others have the decorative  
finish applied to one or both faces. Common panel types include\:  
• Solid phenolic resin panels with wood fiber binder\: These have a  
decorative face on one or both sides, with a black core.  
• Engineered wood panels, with veneers and/or cores in clear  
resin \: In these, the exposed face is available in a variety of high-  
quality wood veneers.  
• Resin panels with mineral filler\: These panels are generally  
integrally colored through the entire thickness.  
• Panel\: Panel should be mounted to allow for relatively large  
amounts of thermal movement. Exposed fastener systems must  
provide oversized holes. Concealed clip systems should allow  
sliding of connections.  
• Structural backup\: CMU or gypsum sheathing over cold-formed  
metal framing.  
• Weather barrier\: Continuous barrier applied over sheathing or  
CMU.  
• Insulation\: Board or blanket insulation installed in the airspace  
between suspension system members.  
• Suspension system\: Commonly extruded aluminum or cold-  
formed galvanized steel furring with mounting clips, that may be  
propriety to the panel manufacturer. Wood battens can be used  
in residential or light commercial construction.  
• Through-wall flashing\: Stainless steel or aluminum sheet incor-  
porated with weather barrier. Flashing must incorporate open-  
ings to allow ventilation and weeping of cavity.  
backup wall allows for a continuous application with a minimum of  
breaks or gaps. If CMU backup is used, the mass stays within the  
insulation, providing thermal dampening.  
Avoid insulation in the stud space, unless dictated by economics.  
If required, evaluate the assembly for the proper location of the  
weather barrier and the loss of effectiveness of the insulation  
because of thermal bridges through the studs. A weather barrier  
should be installed over the sheathing; dependent on climatic  
conditions the weather barrier may need to be vapor-permeable.  
Panels range from 4 by 8 ft. to 5 by 12 ft. Thickness ranges from  
5/16 to 1/2 in.  
Water can penetrate the exterior face of a building when wind is  
driven through the cracks and unsealed surfaces. The rainscreen  
wall is based on a principle of providing a small air gap between  
the wall face and a water-proofed inner wall. This allows the mois-  
ture to be directed out. Companies produce a variety of proprietary  
synthetic stucco rainscreen systems based on this principle. The  
systems vary from exterior insulation boards that have extruded  
channels, drainage panels, and troweled adhesive, to facilitate  
water drainage. Particular attention is to be given to system flash-  
ing and sealing at expansion and control joints, wall openings such  
as windows and doors, or any water barrier penetrations within  
the wall structure.  
Not all panel types are available in all finishes.  
• Solid colors with smooth surfaces and satin gloss\: Standard color  
ranges are wide, and custom colors are available for larger runs.  
In commercial construction, high-rise situations, or where very  
high performance is required, rainscreen panel walls should be  
detailed as drained cavity walls; though they can also be pressure-  
equalized walls. This wall system performs very well in all climates.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
Stucco is a traditional exterior finish material, typically three coats  
of portland cement plaster, applied over weather barrier to create  
a drainage plane wall system. It is impact- and fire-resistant; and  
because it is applied in a plastic state, it can be made to conform  
to virtually any shape. Durable stucco is, however, highly depen-  
dent on knowledgeable and skilled application, as many of the  
problems attributed to stucco \(e.g., cracking, delamination, water  
leakage\) are not inherent to the product but are the result of  
improper installation.  
Stucco is applied in three coats\: scratch, brown, and finish.  
• The scratch and brown coats are portland cement plaster, typi-  
cally each approximately 3/8-in. thick; together they are called  
the base coat. The base coat must be moist-cured for two days,  
then further curing of five days before application of the finish  
coat. In very hot or windy conditions, it may be necessary to  
protect the base coat with tarps or sheeting.  
• The scratch coat is so-called because, after application, the  
surface is roughened with a rake or other device to promote a  
mechanical bond of the brown coat.  
• The brown coat is applied after the scratch coat has set up. IBC  
requires a minimum or 24 hours between coats if damp-curing is  
used, or 48 hours without. In the recent past, one week was  
common for curing. It is important that the scratch coat be prop-  
erly cured before the application of the brown coat, to minimize  
the cracking. The brown coat may be reinforced with a variety of  
fibers, and it must be trowel-floated while still moist but after  
taking an initial set, to densify the surface and further reduce  
cracking. Application of the brown coat before the scratch coat  
has properly cured, and failure to make the additional trowel-  
float pass, are common causes of cracking in the finished stucco.  
• The finish coat may be either portland cement plaster or acrylic,  
typically 1/8-in. thick. Portland cement-based finish coats are  
likely to be more durable, but acrylic finish coats generally have  
better color consistency. Factory-mixed finish coat mixes  
improve color consistency of cement-based finish coats.  
barrier is very difficult. Without a backup, it is difficult to main-  
tain a consistent thickness of the stucco, resulting in increased  
cracking. A reasonable amount of moisture will be introduced  
into insulation in the stud space, so drying of the entire assembly  
must be analyzed. The location or need of a vapor retarder must  
be analyzed to allow for drying. The interior gypsum board will  
need to be detailed as a continuous weather barrier.  
• Stucco on sheathing\: In this assembly, the sheathing provides  
for a better substrate for both the weather barrier and the  
stucco, resulting in improved performance of the drainage  
plane; moreover, the sheathing can be appropriately detailed as  
the weather barrier. Insulation in the stud space is susceptible  
to wetting and must be analyzed for moisture accumulation. The  
location or need of a vapor retarder must be analyzed to also  
allow for drying. In hot climates, the weather barrier can be  
upgraded to a weather barrier for improved performance.  
• Stucco on board insulation\: Moving the insulation to the outside of  
the sheathing allows for the installation of a continuous weather  
barrier, and improves performance of the drainage plane. Wetting  
of insulation within the stud space is eliminated, so this type of  
assembly is more appropriate for colder and wetter climates.  
• Stucco on furring\: Spacing the stucco away from the insulation  
creates a drainage cavity and improves the performance of the  
system. However, because a solid layer does not continuously  
back the lath, it is difficult to maintain consistent thickness of  
the stucco. Paper-faced lath is helpful.  
Portland cement stucco is a cement-based mixture of sand, lime,  
water, and portland cement. It is typically troweled directly onto  
the masonry or over metal lath, either in two or three coat layers.  
Synthetic stucco, or Exterior Insulation Finish System, is formed of  
foam boards and coated with acrylic resin \(which is similar to paint\).  
A fine or coarse sand aggregate is added to the finish coat to give  
it a textured appearance, similar to cement-based stucco. It can be  
applied directly to a sheathing substrate, masonry, or concrete.  
Lath is typically expanded metal or welded wire mesh of galvanized  
steel. Self-furring lath has crimps or dimples to space it off the  
substrate, allowing proper embedment of the stucco. Lath is avail-  
able with a paper backing, but this should be avoided, because it is  
extremely difficult to create laps in the paper to properly control  
the flow of water.  
Accessories should be formed from rust-resistant materials. Zinc  
is preferred, but depending on application and conditions, galva-  
nized steel may be acceptable. Plastic accessories are also avail-  
able. All accessories that are used at the base of the system \(such  
as edge screeds, control joints, and expansion joints\) must be  
perforated to allow drainage of water from within the stucco.  
Stucco requires weather barrier behind the lath to control the  
penetration of water. The paper must be continuous and properly  
shingled over each sheet and accessories to direct the flow of  
water. The weather barrier gets wet during application of the  
stucco and, after drying, pulls away from stucco, creating the  
drainage plane.

Stucco should be applied over weather barrier to create a drainage  
plane wall assembly. Stucco applied directly to CMU or concrete,  
which both function as a barrier system, should be limited to very  
dry climates. The performance of stucco assemblies can be  
upgraded by detailing the wall as a drainage cavity with insulation.  
Wall assemblies fall into five categories\:  
• Stucco on CMU\: Limit the use of this assembly to very dry cli-  
mates. Insulation needs to be added within the CMU cores or  
applied to the inside surface. \(Refer to the analysis for single  
wythe masonry.\)  
• Stucco on studs\: Application of stucco over open studs is possi-  
ble, but not recommended, as proper installation of the weather  
Cement-based stucco dries hard, and is therefore susceptible to  
cracking. Placement of joints prevents cracking and spalling of  
stucco and results in long-lasting exterior finish.  
Control joint is a technique used to isolate or limit cracking due to  
internally or externally induced stresses. Stresses in exterior  
building envelopes can be caused by shrinkage, movement, or dis-  
similarity of materials. Joints should extend the full width and  
height of wall panels and should coincide with square corners such  
as windows, doors, or changes in heights.  
A joint can be handled by insertion of a metal device which allows  
for construction and expansion caused by dissimilarity of materi-  
als, settlement, or building movements.  
Joints in the stucco substrate such as masonry, concrete, or cold-  
formed metal stud walls, should be carried through to avoid crack-  
ing. The following are good principles for joint location and spacing\:  
• Length of wall no greater than 18 ft. in either direction  
• Panel area not to exceed 144 sq. ft. for vertical applications  
• Panel area should not exceed 100 sq. ft. for horizontal applica-  
tion, whether curved or angular

• Length-to-width ratio should not exceed 2 1/2 to 1 in any given  
panel.  
• Joints are required at transition of materials or where joints are  
present in the substrate concrete, masonry, or masonry veneer  
walls.  
The types of plywood recommended for exterior siding are APA  
grade trademarked, medium-density overlay \(MDO\), Type 303 sid-  
ing; or Texture 1-11 \(T1-11 special 303 siding\). T1-11 plywood siding  
is manufactured with 3/8-in.-wide parallel grooves and shiplapped  
edges. MDO, which is recommended for paint finishes, is available  
in a variety of surfaces. The 303 plywood panels are also available  
in a wide variety of surfaces. The most common APA plywood siding  
panel dimensions are 4 in. by 8 ft., but the panels are also available  
in 9-ft and 10-ft lengths, with lap siding to 16 ft.

Detailing stone panel wall assemblies is important; consider the  
following recommendations\:  
• Because of the cost and weight of stone, a highly reliable backup  
and support system is recommended.  
• Provide a continuous weather barrier over the face of the  
sheathing.  
• Insulation is located in the cavity; not in the stud space.  
• CMU may be used for backup, instead of studs and sheathing.  
• Bolt anchors to steel studs.  
• Design considerations for bearing and retaining anchors  
include\: width of cavity, adjustability of slotted connections, shim  
systems, avoidance of down-turned slots, and minimum thick-  
ness between anchor slot and face of stone.

Fabricated stone panel technology offers savings in on-site labor  
and accuracy in the joining of component stone units.  
Shipping and erection stresses on the stone panels and stone  
anchorage system of the fabricated units should be evaluated.  
Design of sealant joints between fabricated units should include at  
least the following\:  
• Thermal movement  
• Fabrication and erection tolerances  
• Irreversible material growth or shrinkage  
• Sealant movement potential  
Stone panels are mounted in a steel frame, with expansion anchors  
and dowel pins \(as recommended by the fabricator\). Joints  
between the panels are sealed with epoxy, maintaining a gap of  
approximately 1/8-in. Stone panels in the assembly are anchored  
as a unit to the building structure. Fabricated stone panel installa-  
tion reduces individual leveling, plumbing, and aligning; and on-site  
joint sealing is not as extensive as with individual stone panels.  
Stone units are bonded to reinforced precast concrete panels with  
bent stainless steel anchors. A weather barrier and a bonding  
agent are installed between the stone and concrete in conditions  
where concrete alkali slats may stain stone units.  
Stone units are shimmed and anchored to a steel frame using  
standard stone connecting hardware. Joints may be sealed on-site,  
along with joints between assemblies.

Fabricated stone panels function as mass barrier systems, similar  
to precast concrete. Use a double line of sealant with weeps.  
A traditional structural stone wall typically consists of two indepen-  
dent faces \(interior and exterior\) of closely fitted stones, with a  
code-prescribed percentage of bonding unit stones that extend the  
full thickness of the wall. Together, these two stone faces create a  
massively thick wall, rarely less than 24 in. thick. A stud or furred  
wall and insulation typically finish the interior wall assembly. The

need for a vapor retarder, and the placement of the vapor retarder  
within the wall assembly, is determined by climate zone.  
For structural stone walls, it is best to lay the stone in regular  
courses, 12 to 15 in. high per course. Limiting the height from the  
top of one level course to the top of the next level course ensures  
that the wall joints will be consistently bridged, thereby avoiding  
long continuous vertical joints both perpendicular and parallel to  
the plane of the wall face. This will help prevent long cracks from  
developing, which can cause large sections of the wall to split and  
fall off.  
Control joints should be built into masonry construction in wall  
sections up to 30 ft. long to account for expansion and contraction  
of the stone.  
A simple rule of thumb for masonry construction is to rely on grav-  
ity, not the bond of mortar, as the predominant “bonding agent” for  
stone. Consult codes to determine the minimum percentage of  
bonding units per structural stone wall. Some codes require that 15  
percent of the face area be composed of bonding units.  
The thickness of veneer depends on the type of stone, to be veri-  
fied with the supplier or quarry.  
11.279 Some building codes require full-span bonding units while others  
permit a minimum 6-in. overlap between adjacent stones.

Cast stone is an architectural concrete unit manufactured to simu-  
late natural cut stone. Cast stone can be used as a rainscreen  
veneer in an exterior enclosure wall assembly, essentially using  
the same methods as brick veneer. Individual pieces of cast stone  
may also be supported and anchored in much the same manner as  
dimensional stone.  
Cast stone can be used for trim items \(e.g., belt courses, window-  
sills, lintels, quoins, cornices, or copings\) or for complete building  
facing. Cast stone is manufactured using cement and aggregates,  
with pigment only for color; or white cement with white sand and  
integrally colored aggregate \(from crushed marble or granite\) can  
be used for color and texture.  
Cast stone is typically cast facedown in a mold with five formed  
sides and unformed back. For economy, L- or U-shaped pieces  
should be avoided, because the complicated forms are more costly  
than simply making a larger piece.

It is possible to panelize major pieces of complete wall assemblies.  
Panels are typically one structural bay wide and either one story  
high \(if the design includes punched windows\) or one spandrel high  
\(if a horizontal strip window design is used\). Anchoring of the  
panels includes one fixed-gravity anchor, one sliding-gravity  
anchor, and the remainder of the anchors for lateral loading only.  
Gravity anchors are preferred to be located near the top of a panel  
for erection safety.  
Panelization provides a variety of benefits. Erection of the enclosure  
can be done faster and safer and during inclement weather, and  
factory fabrication provides a higher level of quality control and  
tighter tolerances. Although panelization does not usually result in a  
large cost savings, in comparison to conventional construction other  
savings can be realized\: in schedule, temporary heat/enclosures,  
freeing up of the site to other trades, and similar considerations.  
• Structural supporting frame\: This is usually designed as a truss,  
to span from column to column, and is fabricated from struc-  
tural steel shapes and/or cold-formed metal framing.  
• Sheathing\: Galvanized steel sheets are used to help provide  
structural rigidity, and gypsum sheathing is also common.  
• Weather barrier\: When gypsum sheathing is used, a weather  
barrier is required. The galvanized steel sheet may be detailed,  
with all joints shingled and sealed to form a weather barrier.  
• Insulation\: Insulation is installed in the airspace. Blanket insu-  
lation installed between the studs may be acceptable in some  
climates, but is not recommended.  
• Rainscreen panel\: Nearly all claddings that are used in drainage  
cavity or pressure-equalized wall assemblies are good candi-  
dates for panelization. These include brick, cast stone, and  
dimensional stone; aluminum composite material and plate  
architectural metal panels; formed metal panels; terra-cotta;  
resin-based panels; and EIFS.  
• Interior finish\: Normally, gypsum board is installed at the project  
site on furring or studs.  
The perimeter flashing required for the shipping and field-joining of  
the panels results in a pressure-equalized rainscreen system that  
performs well in all climates and extreme precipitation. A potential  
weakness for panelized systems is at the panel joints; therefore, a  
double line of sealant with weepholes is required at panel-to-panel  
joints.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
Metal wall panels fall into two primary categories\: field assembled  
and factory formed. Metal wall panels span between 4 and 15 ft.,  
depending on gauge of metal, panel thickness, and wind load.  
Finish on metal panels can be raw galvanized sheet or any number  
of various factory-applied finishes ranging from baked-on enamel  
to high-performance polyvinyldene flouride \(PVDF\) coatings.  
3\. Subgirts are screwed to liner panel flanges.  
4\. Outer metal panels are screwed to subgirts. Outer panels can be  
corrugated, standing seam, batten, or formed into box shapes.  
Fasteners that are typically exposed \(but concealed fasteners  
are available\).  
The order of assembly for these panels is as follows\:  
1\. Metal liner panels are secured to structural girts with self-drilling,  
self-tapping screws. Liner panels are typically 24 in. wide. The  
depth of the liner panel is determined based on required insula-  
tion \(2 to 4 in.\).  
2\. Semirigid mineral wool insulation located on the inside liner  
panel.  
Panels are typically between 24 and 36 in. wide, up to 40 ft. long,  
and between 2 and 4 in. thick. Panels are fabricated either by  
laminating inner and outer sheet metal skins to rigid insulation or  
by injecting expanding foam between the two skins. Panels can be  
oriented horizontally or vertically and are available in a large  
number of profiles. Horizontally oriented panels provide rainscreen  
design joints.

Field-assembled insulated metal panels are drainage cavity-type  
walls. Water that may penetrate the outer skin is weeped to the  
outside by through-wall flashing. Factory-formed panels are avail-  
able with pressure-equalized rainscreen-type joints or shingled  
overlap joints. For both types of systems, the inner sheet metal skin  
functions as the air barrier and must be sealed to make the system  
perform. Most panels accomplish this with a factory-installed gas-  
ket or bead of noncuring sealant inside of the receiving groove that  
is then compressed by the tongue during installation. Relatively  
slight misalignment of panels will not provide the proper compres-  
sion of this inside seal, resulting in a large air leak and loss of  
function of the rainscreen joint. Joints across the short direction of  
the panel cannot be fabricated with the tongue and groove.  
Typically, the joints are backed up with girts or flashing, and the  
panels are bedded in sealant and an outer wet seal or dry gasket  
is added.  
Metal cladding panels are made in a wide variety of shapes and  
sizes. However, if properly designed as part of a drained cavity wall  
or drainage plane wall, all of them can perform well. Most of the  
panels, except interlocking tiles, can span several feet over a  
spaced support system.  
Following is a list of cladding panel types\:  
• Formed sheet metal\: Made up of aluminum, galvanized steel,  
and, less common, stainless steel, zinc, or copper, these panels  
are formed into corrugated, standing seam, batten, or box  
shapes with exposed or concealed fasteners.  
• Aluminum composite material\: These types of panels consist of  
two gauge metal layers of aluminum bonded to a rigid plastic  
core. These panels are very flat and easily fabricated into a  
variety of configurations and mounting methods.  
• Plate\: Typically made up of 1/8-in.-thick solid aluminum or stain-  
less steel, this panel is stretcher-leveled and fabricated with  
folded-back perimeter frames.  
• Interlocking flat lock seam tiles\: These panels are made from  
light-gauge copper, zinc, lead-coated copper, titanium, and stain-  
less steel; they are shop-formed into small interlocking tiles for  
installation over a continuous substrate.  
• ACM and plate systems\: A wide variety of proprietary mounting  
methods for large-scale architectural panels are available, with  
associated pros and cons.  
• Staggered clip mounting\: Clips around the perimeter of the  
panels are spaced so that clips of adjacent panels do not over-  
lap. ACM and plate systems can be formed for this mounting  
system, with wet sealant joints or dry gaskets. The primary  
advantage of this system is that it allows for nonsequential  
erection and repair of isolated panels without disturbing the  
remainder of the field.  
• Tongue-and-groove clip mounting\: Perimeter panel extrusions  
are supported by spaced tongue-and-groove type clips. Each clip  
supports the gravity load of only one panel while restraining the  
other panel against wind and allowing movement. Joints can be  
wet-sealed or dry-gasketed but are more commonly dry-splined  
with the same material as the panel fitting into the perimeter  
extrusion, though the spline can be the same or a contrasting  
finish. While requiring sequential erection, this system provides  
for less oil-canning of the panel and better joint alignment.  
• Hook-and pin mounting\: This is the most common plate system;  
each panel has hooks in the vertical edge that engage pins in  
vertical channels mounted to the support grid. The horizontal  
joints include a shingled overlapping joint that direct water to  
the vertical channel. Fabrication costs tend to make this system  
more expensive, but the free movement for flatness  
and nonsequential erection are positives.  
• Route and return\: Route and return is a method to fold ACM, and  
sometimes plates, to a very tight corner. A V-groove is routed  
out of the back of the panel, leaving only the thin outer skin  
intact, and then the edges are folded \(or returned\). Perimeter  
frames may or may not be added.  
• Continuous edge grip\: ACM panels have an extremely small  
groove routed in the plastic interlayer around the full perimeter  
of the panels. Aluminum extrusions with a small tongue are  
glued into this groove to hold the panel. A very small edge of the  
perimeter extrusion is visible.  
• Dry-gasketed joints\: Soft silicone, EPDM, or neoprene extruded  
gaskets provide a neater joint, easier future access to fasteners  
under the joint, and good weather performance.  
• Dry-splined joints\: Joints splined with ACM or plates may pro-  
vide the sharpest corners and cleanest edges.  
• Open joint systems\: These panel systems consist of baffles and  
shingled flashing for pressure-equalized rainscreen systems.  
• Finishes\: Some metals have inherent finishes such as zinc, cop-  
per, and galvanized steel. Most metals require applied finishes  
that include anodized, color anodized, polyvinylidene fluoride  
\(PVDF\), baked-on enamels, powder coatings, and many others.  
PVDF coatings have become very common because of their wide  
range of colors and metallic finishes, extreme durability, and  
color consistency.  
None of the metal cladding panels may provide a waterproof sys-  
tem by themselves. In fact, many of the ACM and plate systems  
require an air barrier to fully function. Note that a common stan-  
dard for testing performance of the panels does not yet exist. The  
panels should always be installed over a water-resistant substrate  
that allows drainage and weeping of any water that may penetrate  
the joints. The most dependable method is to install the panels as  
a drained cavity system by mounting the panels on a support grid  
spaced away from the sheathing line with an applied A/V barrier  
membrane and insulation between the supports. Alternative sys-  
tems may place some or all of the insulation inside stud cavities if  
proper evaluation of heat loss, vapor flow, and wetting and drying  
are considered. Interlocking flat lock seam tiles require a continu-  
ous nailable substrate, and, therefore, the provision of a proper  
drainage cavity can require multiple layers.  
For high-rise or high-wind applications, the systems can be  
stepped up to a true pressure-equalized system by partitioning the  
drainage cavity behind the metal panels. Either the joint system  
should admit air \(such as dry splines or hook and pin\) or vents will  
be required in addition to the weeps. Joints must be designed to  
resist kinetic energy with sloped or vertical dams, break surface  
tension with drips, and eliminate capillary draw with joints at least  
3/8 in. wide.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems \(EIFS\) provide an un-  
interrupted layer of board insulation, mechanically fastened but  
more typically adhered over a water-resistive membrane to the  
exterior walls of the building and then covered with a very thin  
layer of reinforced polymer-modified cement membrane \(lamina\).  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
The lamina consists of a base coat, reinforcing, and a finish coat.  
An EIFS is categorized by the lamina, either polymer-modified \(PM\)  
or polymer-based \(PB\). PM systems are thicker \(3/16 in. or more\)  
and have a higher cement content resulting in a harder finish. PB  
systems have a much higher proportion of polymer to cement and  
have a total thickness less than 1/8 in.  
• Reinforcing\: Reinforcing is typically fiberglass mesh and is avail-  
able in several weights. Heavier weights are used where impact  
resistance is required but puncture is still likely at sidewalks or  
other high-traffic zones. It may be better to use a more durable  
material for the first floor or provide a wainscot.  
• Finishes\: Many colors are available in textures ranging from  
very smooth to medium rough. The smoothest finishes tend to  
telegraph more imperfections of the base coats. Some base  
coats now have silicone or other additives to help keep the  
surface clean.  
generally limited to polymer-modified \(PM\) systems. Polymer-  
based \(PB\) systems, especially with a weather barrier, are typi-  
cally applied with adhesive. Note that while mechanical fasteners  
may seem to be a good safeguard, they can limit the flexibility of  
the PB lamina or cause ghosting.  
The substrate should be prepared with sealants, tapes, and primer  
to receive a water-resistive barrier membrane. The substrate and  
membrane together will provide an air barrier.  
Typically expanded polystyrene is used but extruded polystyrene or  
other noncombustible types may be incorporated dependent on  
construction classification. Insulation thickness ranges from 1 to 6  
in. The insulation should be grooved or spaced away from the  
substrate to create a drainage plane. Mechanical fasteners are  
Joints in EIFS must be carefully located and detailed for their  
intended purpose. Aesthetic reveal joints provide for movement of  
the lamina and should be trapezoid or half-round shapes. V-shaped

or square joints may flex and crack the lamina. Control joints  
should be detailed to extend completely through the system and be  
wide enough to allow for anticipated movement. Note that the bond  
of the sealant may be stronger than the bond of the finish to the  
base coats, so carefully select low-modulus sealant paired with  
proper joint width and detail joints for adhesion to base coat, not  
finish coat. Also, note that it is nearly impossible to properly reseal  
EIFS because it is very difficult to remove joint sealant from the  
lamina. Therefore, it is imperative to select the joint sealant and  
detail the joint.  
A variety of thin membranes are available, which, under laboratory  
conditions, may be waterproof, but actually only slow water absorp-  
tion because of their inability to bridge large cracks, accelerated  
weathering, and thin application. Because of this inevitable leak-  
age, water repellants cannot replace proper detailing and construc-  
tion of truly waterproof wall assemblies. Water repellants may  
provide passable performance on existing structures where retrofit  
of flashings, drainage plane, and weather barriers are not feasible.  
EIFS are based on a face-sealed, thin-barrier system to resist  
moisture. Except for EIFS applied over CMU or concrete in struc-  
tures where interior moisture control is not necessary, systems  
that use an internal drainage plane to add moisture protection are  
highly recommended. The location of the insulation layer fully out-  
side the structure and supporting walls provides continuous and  
dependable barrier to heat loss/gain. EIFS does not breathe well;  
consequently, it is very important not to trap vapor within a wall  
assembly. Most EIFS manufacturers provide analysis of the com-  
plete wall assembly to decide whether a separate vapor barrier is  
necessary and if so, its proper location. The sheathing of the typical  
backup wall system needs to provide the air barrier so must be  
designed continuous and detailed to meet windows, doors, pene-  
trations, and transitions to other systems. The water barrier  
membrane supplied with drainage plane EIFS will typically require  
that the joints in the sheathing be taped or sealed.  
Clear repellants are typically used for concrete, CMU, brick, stone,  
and sometimes wood. Clear repellants come in two basic types\:  
penetrating and film-forming sealers.  
• Penetrating sealers typically include siloxanes, silanes, or com-  
binations of the two. Advantages include resistance to UV deg-  
radation, vapor permeability, low color change, and usability on  
walkable surfaces.  
• Film-forming surfaces include acrylics and urethanes. There is a  
relatively high risk of unsightly failure if vapor pressure is pres-  
ent under the film. However, they can fill larger cracks and work  
over rougher concrete and wood.  
Clear repellants are typically applied by sprayed-on flood coating in  
one or two coats.  
Comparisons of manufacturers marketing claims of the many vari-  
eties and concentrations of clear water repellants can be difficult.  
Review generic evaluations relative to the specific product type  
and check for proven performance on similar substrates in similar  
situations. Test an inconspicuous sample panel for performance  
and appearance before finalizing materials selection.

Properly installed EIFS does not allow water to penetrate the  
system. However, many buildings clad with EIFS have suffered  
from problems. From the design professional’s \(and, more impor-  
tantly, the owner’s\) point of view, it is meaningless whether the  
problems are caused by the EIFS itself or are the result of poor  
construction at penetrations and transitions. Therefore, the follow-  
ing recommendations should be followed to increase the likelihood  
of a successful installation\:  
• Use a reputable manufacturer.  
• Enlist the assistance of the manufacturer during the design and  
detailing process.  
• Do not allow the installation of “accidental” vapor retarders  
such as vinyl wall covering.  
• Ensure that all products within the system are from one manu-  
facturer and that the manufacturer confirms compatibility and  
recommends use of the products in the exact configuration  
intended for the project.  
• Ensure that the manufacturer has adequately trained and certi-  
fied the installer.  
• Arrange to have a manufacturer’s technical representative visit  
the site periodically during installation.  
• Use an internal drainage plane system, and avoid face-sealed  
barrier walls. Detail the drainage indicating flashing and weep-  
holes.  
• Use a moisture-resistant substrate. Do not use paper-faced  
gypsum sheathing or OSB.  
• Provide a continuous weather barrier behind the EIFS.  
• Do not expose any portions of the EIFS at horizontal areas. Flash  
windowsills, copings, and projections with sheet metal.  
• For joints\:  
• Understand the limitations and best profiles of aesthetic joints  
within the system.  
• Honor movement joints in the substrate through the EIFS.  
• Joints between EIFS should use a double line of low-modulus  
silicone sealant with closed-cell backer rods.  
• Performance of EIFS depends strictly on adherence to the  
manufacturer’s instructions. Quality measures beyond the  
requirements of other systems are reasonable.  
• Require a large-scale mock-up, including typical joints, plus a  
window and other typical penetrations.  
• Require inspection of the water-resistant layer prior to covering  
with insulation.  
• Require periodic or continuous third-party inspections appropri-  
ate to the complexity of the project.  
Cementitious coatings are typically portland cement-based with  
fine aggregate and additives to enhance bond, water and freeze-  
thaw resistance, and color. Cementitious coatings are generally  
brittle and will not bridge cracks. They are breathable, have excel-  
lent bonding strengths, and weathering capabilities, but may cause  
a substantial change to the appearance of the building. Crystalline  
waterproofing is also available, which fills the microscopic pores of  
concrete and CMU.  
Cementitious coatings are usually applied by spray, but may also be  
brushed or troweled. For mortar between brick, the brick must be  
either masked individually or wiped clean after spraying \(so-called  
bagged because of the burlap bags used\).  
Elastomeric coatings are essentially high-build elastomeric paint,  
either water- or solvent-based. Some products are breathable.  
Elastomeric coatings have the highest crack-bridging capabilities,  
and can be applied over most substrates; but they have a drastic  
effect on the appearance of the building, may fade, and may  
require relatively frequent reapplication.

11.295 This assembly reduces the exposure of the heavy timber frame  
by partially concealing the frame in the wall system. It allows air  
infiltration due to shrinkage and movement, and requires an exterior  
board insulation layer to minimize the potential for air movement and  
condensation.

of the foam core\) may be needed at areas that may have excess stress  
or loading, with interior finish attached to the frame before the panels  
are attached.

Hand in hand with such things as heat loss and insulation, comes  
the problems of moisture condensation and how to avoid it.  
There is moisture in all the air around us. The amount is determined  
partially by the temperature of the air. Warm air can hold more  
moisture than cold air. When the air at a given temperature has all  
of the moisture that it can hold, it is said to be at 100 percent rela-  
tive humidity for that temperature. If it contains 50 percent of the  
total moisture it can hold, then it is at 50 percent relative humidity.  
Air this saturated with moisture vapor will form water droplets if it  
is cooled, because it can’t contain as much vapor at lower tem-  
peratures. When humid air contacts a cold surface, it is cooled to  
saturation and moisture droplets or condensation occurs. It has  
been cooled below its dew point temperature.  
Any building section may be analyzed using simple calculations to  
determine where condensation might occur and what might be  
done in selecting materials or their method of assembly to elimi-  
nate that possibility. The section may or may not contain a vapor  
retarder, or it may contain an inadequate one; the building section  
may include cold-side materials of comparatively high resistance to  
the passage of vapor \(which is highly undesirable\). With few excep-  
tions, the vapor resistance at or near the warm surface should be  
five times that of any components. Figure 11.306 supplies perme-  
ance and permeability of common building and vapor barrier  
materials. These values can be used in analyzing building sections  
by the following simple method\:  
1\. List the materials, without surface films or airspaces, in the  
order of their appearance in the building section, beginning with  
the inside surface material and working to the outside.  
2\. Against each material, list the permeance \(or permeability\)  
value from the figure, or a more accurate value if available from  
tests or manufacturers’ data. Where a range is given, select an  
average value or use judgment in assigning a value based on the  
character and potential installation method of the material pro-  
posed for use.  
3\. Start at the top of the list and note any material that has less  
permeance than the materials above it on the list. At that point,  
the possibility exists that vapor leaking through the first mate-  
rial may condense on the second, provided the dew point \(con-  
densation point\) is reached and the movement is considerable.  
In that case, provide ventilation through the cold-side material  
or modify the design to eliminate or change the material to one  
of greater permeance.  
In this example, the vapor barrier transmits one grain of moisture  
per square foot per hour for each unit of vapor pressure differ-  
ence, or one perm; and nothing else transmits less. However, since  
the cold brick veneer is nearly as low in permeance, it is advisable  
to make certain that the vapor barrier is expertly installed, with all  
openings at pipes and with outlet boxes or joints carefully fitted or  
sealed. Alternatively, the brick veneer may have open mortar joints  
near the top and bottom to serve both as weepholes and as vapor  
release openings. They will also ventilate the wall and help reduce  
heat gain in summer.  
Vapor \(under pressure\) would easily pass through the interior  
gypsum board finish, be slowed by the concrete masonry unit, and

The weather barrier is required to have the following characteristics\:  
• Be continuous throughout the envelope \(at the lowest floor,  
exterior walls, and ceiling or roof\), with sealed connections  
between all transitions in planes and changes in materials, at all  
joints and seams, and at all penetrations.  
• Be joined and sealed in a flexible manner to the weather barrier  
component of adjacent assemblies, allowing for the relative  
movement of these assemblies and components.  
• Be capable of withstanding positive and negative combined  
design wind, fan, and stack pressures on the weather barrier  
without damage or displacement; and transfer the load to the  
structure. It must not displace adjacent materials under full  
load.  
• Where lighting fixtures or other similar devices are to be  
installed in such a way as to penetrate the weather barrier,  
provisions must be made to maintain the integrity of the barrier.

In addition, alternating freezing and thawing of condensation  
within the masonry wall can physically damage the construction.  
These types of analyses are not appropriate for buildings in mixed-  
climate areas. For additional instructions see Chapter 11, “Design  
Tools,” by Anton TenWolde, in Moisture Control in Buildings , \(ASTM  
Manual, No. 18\) Heinz R. Trechsel \(ed.\), published by ASTM, 1984.  
Many common building materials \(concrete, plywood, roofing  
membranes, rigid insulation, and gypsum board\) are capable of  
functioning as a weather barrier. For small-scale and residential  
construction, it is common to use either the sheathing or interior  
drywall as the weather barrier. Special sealing of these materials  
is required, but otherwise construction does not differ substan-  
tially from traditional frame construction. In commercial construc-  
tion, the use of weather barriers applied over sheathing that fulfill  
the structural requirement is common. Common building materials  
that are not weather barriers include CMU, board and blanket  
insulation \(even if compressed\), and polyethylene sheets \(that are  
taped as well\).  
• Mechanically fastened membranes are lightweight sheets typi-  
cally installed with mechanical fasteners. Their installation does  
not require special surface preparation such as drying, priming,  
or taping of sheathing joints. Building wraps are vapor-perme-  
able membranes, even though their vapor permeability varies  
widely depending on the membrane type and the manufacturer.  
The main types of building wraps are\: \(1\) spun-bonded polyole-  
fins, \(2\) microporous films, \(3\) perforated films, and \(4\) asphalt-  
impregnated papers and felt. The seams and fasteners typically  
need to be taped or otherwise sealed.  
• Torch-applied membranes are rubber-modified bitumen, lami-  
nated on a nonwoven substrate. The membrane is designed to  
be fused to a dry, clean, and primed substrate by heating the  
bitumen side with a propane torch. Torch-applied membranes  
are vapor-nonpermeable.  
• Sprayed polyurethane foams \(SPF\) are two-component foam  
membranes that combine thermal insulation and weather bar-  
rier properties. Only a few closed-cell SPF insulation foams have  
the required air infiltration resistance to qualify as air barriers.  
Based on vapor permeability, air barrier membranes are classified  
into vapor-permeable and vapor-nonpermeable membranes \(air  
and vapor barriers\)—Class I, II, III, or IV. Building wraps and a  
few fluid-applied membranes are vapor-permeable though perme-  
ability varies widely among the different types. All other air barrier  
membranes described previously are vapor-nonpermeable.  
Vapor permeability of the weather barrier must be carefully consid-  
ered when selecting a weather barrier for the building enclosure.  
• Vapor-permeable weather barrier membranes can be placed  
anywhere in the wall assembly, based on ease of detailing. The  
membrane is often installed on the outer side of the exterior  
sheathing. In addition, there are no climate limitations for  
vapor-permeable air barriers. Air barriers can and should be  
used in all climates.  
• Vapor-nonpermeable weather barrier membranes generally  
must be located on the warm side of the wall assembly to avoid  
moisture accumulation. “The warm side of the wall assembly” is  
climate-specific. In the United States, with widely varying cli-  
mates, it could be on different sides of the wall during different  
seasons. Consequently, the weather barrier could end up on the  
cold side of the enclosure for part of the year, leading to mois-  
ture accumulation.  
In summary, take into account the considerations listed in  
Figure 11.458 when selecting a weather barrier membrane.  
The Figures 11.307 and 11.308 are simple graphical section analy-  
ses and are limited in reliability. They are two-dimensional, and do  
not include issues such as thermal bridging at insulation in stud  
cavities.  
Computerized modeling is recommended for large projects, assem-  
blies that require seasonal drying, and for projects located in  
mixed climates. WUFI, by Oak Ridge National Laboratory \(www.  
ornl.gov\), is one strong and widely recognized modeling tool.

A weather barrier is a combination of interconnected materials,  
flexible sealed joints, and components of the building envelope that  
provide the airtightness of the building envelope. The main function  
of weather barriers is to prevent unintentional air and moisture  
flow through the building enclosure. Leakage can affect the occu-  
pants’ comfort, as well as thermal performance and durability of  
the building.  
Air barrier membranes are airtight materials specifically designed  
to control airflow through the building enclosure. The main types of  
air barrier membranes are summarized here. In addition to the  
primary membranes, air barrier systems must include installation  
and continuity accessories such as primers, mechanical fasteners,  
tapes, caulks and sealants, flashing, and transition membranes.  
Based on the application method, air barrier membranes are clas-  
sified into five categories\:  
• Self-adhered \(or peel-and-stick\) membranes are prefabricated  
sheets consisting of rubber-modified asphalt bonded to a carri-  
er film, and protected by release paper on the membrane side.  
These membranes are applied by self-adhesion to a dry, clean,  
and primed substrate. Self-adhered membranes are vapor-  
nonpermeable.  
• Fluid-applied membranes are one- or two-component formula-  
tions in organic solvents or water dispersions, which are spray  
or trowel applied to a dry, clean, and primed substrate. Most  
fluid-applied membranes are vapor-nonpermeable. There are  
fluid-applied membranes that are vapor-permeable, even though  
their permeability is quite low \(\<6 to 7 perms\) and depend on  
the dry film thickness.  
Vapor-permeable Anywhere No climate limitations; use  
in all climates  
Warm side Consider climate to avoid  
condensation and moisture  
accumulation  
The complete building envelope must be designed and constructed  
with a continuous weather barrier to control air and moisture  
leakage into or out of the conditioned space. This includes the  
Vapor-nonpermeable  
\(air and vapor  
barrier\)  
Vapor Retarder requirements for Climate Zones per the  
International Building Code 2009 are as follows\:  
• Class I \(Vapor Barrier\)\: \< 0.1 perms  
• Class II \(Vapor Retarder\)\: 0.1 to 1.0 perms  
• Class III \(Vapor Retarder\)\: 1.0 to 10 perms  
• Class IV \(Vapor Open\)\: \>10 perms  
• Zone1—Not Required  
• Zone 2—Not Required  
• Zone 3—Not Required  
• Zone 4—Class III  
• Zone 4 \(Marine\)—Class II or III  
• Zone 5—Class II or III  
• Zone 6—Class II  
• Zone 7—Class II

IBC does not require Air Barriers in Climate Zones 1, 2, or 3; how-  
ever, ASHRAE 90.1 performance models do require air barriers  
within all climate zones. See 11.1 for map of U.S. climate zones.  
When they are part of a drainage or pressure-equalized wall  
assembly, weather barriers must also be resistant to the passage  
of water. Air barriers are crucial to the functioning of a pressure-  
equalized wall assembly. See Figure 11.310 for integration of  
flashings into these wall types.  
The application of the flashing falls into two categories\: through-  
wall flashing and flexible membrane flashing.  
• Through-wall flashing must typically bridge across the open  
airspace and, therefore, is typically sheet metal. Stainless steel,  
aluminum, galvanized steel, and copper are most common.  
• Flexible membrane flashing is used to bridge gaps, while allow-  
ing movement, and as a transition to other materials, assem-  
blies, and systems. Flexible flashing can be self-adhered peel-  
and-stick membranes, but their use is limited to applications  
that do not require bridging a gap larger than 1/2 in. For larger  
gaps, and where more substantial movement is anticipated,  
neoprene sheets or extruded cured silicone sheets are common.  
Note that the membrane flashing sheets must be compatible  
with all of the adjacent materials they contact.  
Water is present as vapor in indoor and outdoor air and as  
absorbed moisture in many building materials. Within the range of  
temperatures encountered in buildings, water may exist in the liq-  
uid, vapor, or solid states. Moisture-related problems may arise  
from changes in moisture content, from the presence of excessive  
moisture, or from the effects of changes of state \(such as freezing  
within walls, or deterioration of materials because of rotting or  
corrosion\).  
In the design and construction of the thermal envelope of buildings  
\(the enclosure of desired temperatures and humidity\), the behavior  
of moisture must be considered, particularly the change of state  
from vapor to liquid \(condensation\). Problems arise when moisture  
comes into contact with a relatively cold surface \(temperature  
below the dew point\), such as a window, or within outdoor walls or  
under-roof/ceilings. Excessive condensation within indoor walls  
that enclose cold spaces must be considered.  
Although vapor moves by vapor pressure differences, it is impor-  
tant to recognize that moisture moved in air will move much larger  
quantities of water. Consequently, the causes of air motion must be  
considered, especially the infiltration/exfiltration at undesirable  
leakage rates at windows, doors, and other penetrations through  
the thermal envelope of the building.  
Moisture problems generally occur in seasons when the outdoor  
temperature and vapor pressure are low and there are many  
indoor vapor sources. These sources may be occupant-induced,  
such as cooking, laundering, bathing, breathing, and perspiration,  
or machine-induced, including automatic washers and dryers,  
dishwashers, and humidifiers. All of these sources combine to  
cause vapor pressure indoors to be much higher than outdoors, so  
that the vapor tends to migrate outward through the building  
envelope. Vapor cannot permeate glazed windows or metal doors,  
but many other building materials are permeable to some extent.  
Walls are particularly susceptible to this phenomenon and such  
migration must be prevented, or at least minimized, by the use  
of low-permeance membranes, called vapor retarders . A vapor  
barrier is a material that has a flow rating of one perm or less  
\(1 perm = 1 grain/hr ft.-in. Hg vapor pressure difference\).  
Vapor barriers, when installed along with properly treated joints  
and penetrations, form a vapor barrier assembly, though it does  
not stop all vapor transmission. Vapor barrier assemblies should  
be installed as close as possible to the side of the wall through  
which moisture enters. Therefore, it is important to establish the  
side of moisture entrance in walls of controlled rooms within build-  
ings. Also note that the beneficial effects of good vapor retarders  
will be lost without adequate weather barriers.  
Moisture in building materials usually increases their thermal  
conductance significantly and unpredictably. Porous materials that  
become saturated with moisture lose most of their insulating  
capability and may not regain it when they dry out. Dust, which  
usually settles in airspaces, may become permanently affixed to  
originally reflective surfaces. Moisture migration by evaporation,  
vapor flow, and condensation can transport significant quantities of  
latent heat, particularly through fibrous insulating materials.  
Positive steps should be taken to prevent migration of moisture in  
the form of vapor, and accumulation in the form of water or ice  
within building components. Vapor retarders, correctly located  
near the source of the moisture, are an effective means of prevent-  
ing such migration. Venting of moisture-laden air from bathrooms,  
laundry rooms, and kitchens will reduce indoor vapor pressure, as  
will the introduction of outdoor air with low moisture content.  
obscure unsightly views. Louvers can be fabricated in standard  
rectangles or custom shapes such as circles, triangles, and ellips-  
es. Radiused corners and other details are available from some  
manufacturers. Penthouses frequently incorporate louvered walls  
to screen equipment and provide airflow.  
Standard louver materials are 16-, 18-, or 20-gauge galvanized or  
cold-rolled steel, and 8-, 12-, or 14-gauge extruded aluminum alloy.  
Other metals can be used for special applications. Translucent fiber-  
glass is a standard blade material when daylighting is desirable.  
Fasteners are either aluminum or stainless steel. The dimensions  
shown in the accompanying illustrations are the most common;  
other sizes are available.  
Factory finishing is recommended for maximum control of color  
and durability. The finish for steel louvers is baked enamel, which  
comes in a variety of colors. Aluminum finishes include mill, clear  
lacquer, baked enamel, and anodic. Fluorocarbon polymeric finish  
coatings \(Kynar\), steel or aluminum, resist chalking, ultraviolet  
deterioration, salts, chemicals, and pollutants.  
Mechanically assembled extruded aluminum louvers are the most  
common type of louver assembly on the market. Mechanical fas-  
teners are better than welding in extruded aluminum alloy con-  
struction because annealing occurs near the weld, weakening the  
material along both sides. Also, repairs are easier when mechani-  
cal fasteners are used.  
With sheet metal, welding an assembly of louvers is easier and  
less expensive than using clip angles and screws to fasten the  
blades to the framework.  
Free area is the net area of free airflow through a louver, gener-  
ally measured in square feet or as a percentage of the area in the  
louver type selected. Manufacturers’ free area ratings should  
include the effects of bird or insect screens, which reduce free  
area.  
For all louvers servicing mechanical equipment, consult a mechan-  
ical engineer for their design and specification. Louvers are rated  
for air performance and water penetration and certified through  
the Air Movement and Control Association. The Building Services  
Resources and Information Association also rates the perfor-  
mance of metal louvers.  
Storm-resistant, high-performance louvers can control most rain  
penetration. However, louvers almost always entrain snow or rain,  
especially intake louvers. See the accompanying schematics for  
water management. Consider less-expensive louvers and use a  
waterproof intake plenum for maximum reliability.

Metal architectural louvers allow airflow through a wall for ventila-  
tion, especially of machine exhaust. They protect the interior space  
from vandalism, weather, insects, or birds, and can be used to  
Louver blades come in many shapes, sizes, and performance types  
that vary with the manufacturer; the blades illustrated here repre-  
sent the basic types. Some blades are fixed only; others can be  
opened and shut. The center-to-center dimensions given are  
approximate; generally, standard blades \(not specialty blades such  
as acoustic, air-foil, and so on\) are designed with minimal overlap,  
so they can obstruct views but maximize the free area.  
Standard blades, step blades, high-performance blades, and some  
double-drainable blades can be used with concealed vertical mul-  
lions for a continuous louver design. Verify with the manufacturer.

Louvers using this blade design completely obscure views and are  
tamperproof and storm-resistant. This blade prevents nearly 100  
percent of wind-driven rain from entering \(generally tested with  
winds up to 30 mph for one hour\).  
Designed to provide a high free area \(55 percent\), this blade  
accommodates high air velocities and protects against wind-  
blown precipitation.  
Acoustically insulated air-foil blades block sound from inside or out  
and accommodate high air velocities. Free area is 29 percent, and  
blades may be fixed or operable.  
Standard blades are suitable for most applications where water  
infiltration is not a concern. Free area is approximately 48 percent.  
Single operating panels should not exceed 48 in. wide by 96 in.  
high. This blade can be either fixed or operable.  
Designed to provide high free area \(55 percent\) and low water  
penetration, this blade is not recommended for use with hidden  
mullions; louvers that employ these blades contain integral drains  
in their mullions that direct water away from the inside of the  
louver. All drain troughs must be kept free of debris. They are not  
designed to hinder wind-driven rain.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
Although architects choose fenestration products based on many  
unique priorities and circumstances, a number of common consid-  
erations apply to most situations. Here are the factors that affect  
window choice\:  
• Appearance\: Size and shape, operating type and style, frame  
materials, glass color and clarity  
• Function\: Visible light transmittance \(provision of daylight\),  
glare control, reduction in fading from ultraviolet radiation,  
thermal comfort, resistance to condensation, ventilation, sound  
control, maintenance, and durability  
• Energy performance\: U-value, solar heat gain coefficient \(SHGC\)  
\(which is replacing the shading coefficient\), air leakage, annual  
heating and cooling season performance, and peak load impacts  
• Cost\: Initial cost of window units and installation, maintenance  
and replacement costs, effect on heating and cooling plant  
costs, and cost of annual heating and cooling energy  
Many designers and homeowners find it difficult to assess the  
value of choosing a more energy-efficient window. Although some  
basic thermal and optical properties \(e.g., U-factor, solar heat gain  
coefficient, and air leakage rate\) can be identified if a window is  
properly labeled, this information does not tell how these proper-  
ties influence annual energy use for heating and cooling. This must  
be determined by using an annual energy rating system or by  
computer simulation.  
Any discussion on exterior windows must begin by defining these  
key terms\:  
• Borrowed light\: An interior wall opening or window that allows  
light to be transferred into another space  
• Clerestory\: The portion of a wall above an adjacent roof level;  
also, a fixed or operable window located in this part of a wall  
• Dormer\: A vertical window set above the line of a sloped roof in  
a small projecting space with triangular sidewalls  
• Internal dormer\: A vertical window set below the line of a  
sloped roof.  
• Oriel window\: A bay window supported by brackets, corbeling,  
or cantilevers.  
• Window wall\: A continuous series of fixed or operable sashes,  
separated by mullions that form an entire non-load-bearing wall  
surface.  
• Ribbon window\: A horizontal band of fixed or operable windows  
extending across a significant portion of the facade.  
• Mullion\: A slender vertical member separating lights, sashes,  
windows, or doors.  
• Muntin\: Nonstructural members separating panes within a sash;  
also called a glazing bar or sash bar .  
• Sash\: The basic unit of a window, consisting of frame, glazing,  
and gasketing; may be stationary or operable.

• Windows can be selected of various grades to suit the field  
pressure and higher wind pressures at corners and higher ele-  
vations, or the windows for the entire building can be based on  
the highest wind pressure.  
The 101 specification also provides standards for durability, oper-  
ating forces, safety, materials, hardware, and overall quality.  
Note that the ratings are based on specific test sizes, so it is neces-  
sary to verify that the tested size is at least as large as the win-  
dows required for the project. Also note that the tested window  
rarely includes perimeter pan flashing, receivers, mulled assem-  
blies, or other nonstandard configurations, so it’s important to ask  
the manufacturer how these conditions affect performance.  
Window installation must be detailed as appropriate for the  
generic wall assembly type, as described below.  
• Barrier walls\: Seal the window to the barrier. Use a subsill flash-  
ing to avoid introducing water into the wall. For massive barrier  
walls such as precast concrete, head flashing may be required  
to ensure that water seepage does not get behind the window.  
• Drainage plane walls\: Provide the primary seal of the window to  
the water-resistant drainage plane, and an outer seal in line  
with the wallcovering. The subsill flashing should extend past the  
outer wallcovering.  
• Drained cavity walls\: Provide the primary seal of the window to  
the waterproof inner line of protection and an outer seal to the  
outer wallcovering. The subsill flashing may be detailed to weep  
into the drainage cavity because only incidental water should  
leak around the window.  
• Pressure-equalized \(PE\) rainscreen walls\: Use windows that  
incorporate PE rainscreen technology. Seal the air barrier of the  
window to the wall air barrier; likewise for the rainscreen. The  
subsill flashing may be detailed to seal to the air barrier.  
Performance standards can be divided in three categories\:  
• Structural, air filtration, and water leakage  
• Thermal and condensation  
• Specialized  
Specific exterior climate and desired interior conditions affect the  
thermal performance of windows the most. Carefully evaluate  
these conditions to determine acceptable performance criteria,  
and then select windows that meet the criteria.  
• Thermal performance of windows is rated according to NFRC  
100, through standardized tests of windows. Note that glazing  
can dramatically affect the thermal performance, so verify the  
glazing used in the test versus project requirements.  
• Condensation resistance is determined by AAMA test 1503.1;  
the higher the number, the better the performance. CRF \(con-  
densation resistance factor\) testing is performed on standard-  
sized samples and includes glazing, which can influence the  
results. Note that the CRF test averages out a large number of  
temperature readings, meaning that a high reported value may  
still have areas that perform relatively poorly. If absolutely no  
condensation is acceptable, then greater scrutiny to the actual  
test data versus the final CRF value is recommended.  
• Assuming frames have thermally resistive materials or have  
thermal breaks, the glazing may be the major determinant of  
CRF and overall thermal performance. See Figure 9.4 “Conditions  
That Lead To Condensation On Windows.”  
• Thermal and CRF performance affect not only energy use but  
also occupant comfort. Analyze the area of glazing, the location  
and activity of the occupant, and the use of supplemental heat-  
ing for adequate protection.  
Detail the window installation so that the line of the air barrier  
and/or vapor barrier \(if required\) extends uninterrupted across  
the gap at the perimeter of the window. In windows with glass  
installed using wiggle glazing, or if interior removable stops are  
used, a heel bead may be required to maintain continuity of the air  
barrier between the frame and glass.  
Window installation details must accommodate movement of the  
surrounding structure. Window heads \(particularly at strip win-  
dows\) often are located at shelf angles, and must accommodate  
movement typically in the range of 1/2 in. from above.  
These elements are standardized through ANSI/AAMA/WDMA  
101/I.S. 2-97, “Voluntary Performance Specifications for Windows,  
Skylights, and Glass Doors.” The 101 specification establishes five  
classes for windows and doors\: R, LC, C, HC, and AW \(i.e., residen-  
tial, light commercial, commercial, heavy commercial, and archi-  
tectural, respectively\). This specification was updated in 2002 and  
2005\. In brief, the specification says\:  
• Select the class based on the project. The class titles are some-  
what self-explanatory, but not limiting. AW class windows are  
typically used for institutional type projects, but they can also be  
used on a very high-quality house, for example.  
• Performance is designated by a number that follows the type  
and class. For example, “H-AW 40” designates a double-hung  
architectural window with a design pressure of 40 psf.  
• The number is based on the anticipated structural wind load act-  
ing on the window, as determined from ASCE 7 and as required  
by the building code. Each type and class has minimum perfor-  
mance grades; optional grades increase in 5 psf increments.  
• The designation is based on testing of samples for structural  
performance, air infiltration, and water leakage according to  
standardized methods. The higher the class, the more difficult  
the test.  
Detail the windows to maintain a line of thermal insulation in the  
same plane as in the tested configuration and as intended by the  
window manufacturer. Windows installed over an airspace in a  
drainage cavity wall may be exposed to cold on sides for which  
proper thermal breaks are not provided.  
Standardized test procedures are available to evaluate a great  
many specialized performance criteria, including acoustic isolation,  
blast resistance, forced-entry resistance, and safety impact. Refer  
to AAMA.  
For more information, see the AAMA Window Selection Guide .  
Manufacturers of windows provide only generic details for instal-  
lation. Adjacent construction is frequently shown as a hatched  
single line. Therefore, it is necessary to detail the window frame in  
project-specific assemblies.

Regardless of the quality of the window unit, ultimate performance  
depends on proper installation. The intersection of the window  
frame with surrounding walls has always been a difficult detail, and  
light modern materials have exacerbated the problem. AAMA 2400-  
02, “Standard Practice for Installation of Windows with a Mounting  
Flange in Stud Frame Construction,” and ASTM E2112-01, “Standard  
Practice for Installation of Exterior Windows, Doors and Skylights,”  
both establish a variety of methods for quality installations.  
The architect may desire to exceed the standard installation prac-  
tices for more durable and dependable service. In particular, it is  
recommended to always provide a subsill of sheet metal or other  
impervious material, with watertight end dams and a slope to the  
exterior, and to avoid penetrations in the horizontal portion of the sill.  
Qualified installers who understand the importance of many  
detailed tasks to the overall level of quality are essential. Consider  
AAMA Certified “Installation Masters” or similar independently  
trained and certified installers.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
Glass and metal frame storefront systems typically are designed to  
allow good views into and out of ground-level commercial spaces.  
Metal members and glass sections are assembled on-site to form  
both wall and entrance systems, which typically are attached to the  
floor structure below and the bottom of structure above, or to a  
suspended structural frame above the ceiling. Storefront systems  
typically have lower resistance to air and water infiltration, and  
less structural performance. Most storefront systems are not  
pressure-equalized, but do manage water that penetrates into the  
glazing pocket. Watertight subsills with end dams are required.  
Storefront systems design involves these considerations\:  
• Storefront systems are available in a variety of attachment/  
assembly types, depending on the structural or aesthetic design  
and on the manufacturer. Glass and metal materials come in  
various shapes, colors, profiles, and structural capabilities.  
• Applicable codes must be consulted for safety requirements,  
glass size, thickness, and tempering. Consult all applicable  
codes, standards, and regulations for accessibility require-  
ments. These may include requirements for hardware, thresh-  
olds, opening forces, and closing speeds.  
• Manufacturers’ data on structural adequacy must be consulted  
for required loads, and for frame and transom bar reinforce-  
ment. Calculations for deflection and wind-load stresses must  
be considered in the design of storefront systems. Reinforcing  
for required loads can be provided by steel reinforcing inserts  
or by use of a heavier metal mullion profile. Consult a structural  
engineer for analysis and design.  
• The height of entrance doors is typically 7 ft-0 in. Typical door  
widths are 3 ft-0 in., 3 ft-6 in., pair of 2 ft-6 in., and pair of 3 ft-0  
in. For accessible doors, at least one leaf of a pair must be 32 in.  
minimum clear width.  
• Perimeters of storefront systems are difficult to detail for both  
an outer seal and an inner air/vapor barrier seat. Therefore,  
limit use to low-rise construction, preferably under canopies or  
overhangs in areas of heavy rainfall.  
• Select systems with thermal break and condensation resistance  
factor \(CRF\) to suit interior and exterior conditions.

• Care should be taken to protect the public from the possibility of  
overhead glass breakage. Laminated glass provides the highest  
level of protection, but fully tempered glass may be acceptable.  
• Higher bulkheads can be built up with aluminum tubing and  
applied stops. Locate expansion mullions 20 ft. o.c.  
• Use receptor for deflection or dimensional tolerance.  
Refer to manufacturers’ current recommendations for specific  
applications.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Keep the following in mind when working with storefront systems\:  
• Storefront systems typically require a watertight sill or subsill to  
direct water within the system to the exterior, unless interior or  
protected by a large overhang. Verify the manufacturer’s details  
and customize to suit the project.  
• Review tinted and coated glass applications and details to  
eliminate the possibility of thermal breakage caused by shading  
devices and shadow patterns.  
• Review setting-block spacing, size, and hardness to prevent  
glass slippage and breakage.  
• Weepholes are required at sill for double glazing.  
• Other materials such as hollow metal or wood can be used for  
custom work and in saltwater atmospheres where aluminum  
will corrode.  
• Various aluminum anodized color finishes are available. Class I  
\(0.7 mil\) and Class II \(0.4 mil\) in black, bronze, or clear, are  
standard with most manufacturers. Class I is recommended for  
most exterior applications.  
• To extend life of aluminum and to reduce the tendency of sur-  
face pitting, wash aluminum periodically with water and mild  
detergent.  
• Glass edges mitered at corners are not recommended. Maximum  
vertical span for butt glazing is 10 ft. by 8 ft. wide.  
• Mullions are clear glass. Tinted or coated glass lights may be  
considered for small areas. Maximum vertical span is 30 ft.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR VERTICAL ENCLOSURES  
The term curtain wall was used in the early days of modern archi-  
tecture to describe virtually any enclosure system that was sup-  
ported by the building frame, as opposed to masonry or other  
bearing walls. A modern curtain wall is most typically thought of as  
a metal frame, usually aluminum, with large areas of glass. Other  
materials of metal or stone can be used to infill the frame at  
opaque areas \(such as spandrels at floor framing\). The frames  
span past, and are supported by, the floor edges, as opposed to  
bearing on the floors or spandrel beams. Gravity loads are fre-  
quently supported at every other floor, with lateral supports for  
lateral load only at floors between.  
A curtain-wall system is typically manufactured using one of the  
following methods\:  
• Standard commercial systems use collections of typical mullion  
sections and accessories, which are selected, fabricated, rein-  
forced, and assembled into custom-sized walls to suit the project.  
• Custom systems are designed specifically for the project, using  
specially designed mullions, parts, and accessories. The cost of  
custom design and engineering is offset by the efficiency of  
scale inherent with large projects.  
Curtain-wall water penetration management methods\:  
• The highest-performing systems are fully pressure-equalized  
rainscreen systems, with the glazing pocket around each indi-  
vidual light a pressure-equalization chamber that is separated  
from other lights, weeped, and vented.  
• Nonpressurized systems tend to direct water that penetrates  
the outer seals to vertical mullions, and then weeps at the base  
of wall.  
Curtain-wall installation methods\:  
• Stick systems assemble individual vertical and horizontal mul-  
lions on-site, and infill with glass, metal, stone, or other panels.  
Stick systems require careful attention to sealing the intersect-  
ing members.  
• Unitized systems are substantially factory assembled off-site,  
complete with frames, glazing, and as much trim or accessories  
as reasonable. The panels are typically between 5 and 10 ft.  
wide, and one or two stories high. The unitized panels are  
hoisted onto the wall and anchored in place. Unitized panels are  
more often a custom system than stick systems, and are used  
more often on large or high-rise projects. Because the sealing of  
the intersecting members takes place in a shop or factory, they  
are more likely to be well made. However, the connections  
between units are blind and, therefore, must be carefully engi-  
neered and verified by mock-up testing.  
Curtain-wall glazing types\:  
• Pressure-plate glazing\: In this system, the glass and infill panels  
are installed from the exterior of the building. Pressure-plate  
glazing allows for sealing of all joints in the framing and easy  
integration with an air/vapor barrier. Toe beads, cap beads, or  
complete wet glazing are possible to improve performance.  
However, all of the glass must be handled from scaffolding or  
lifts.  
• Dry glazing\: In this system, the glass and infill panels are  
installed from the interior. The exterior frame is fixed and glazing  
gaskets are installed. Typically, only the top mullion has a remov-  
able interior stop. The glass unit is slid into a deep glazing  
pocket on one jamb far enough to allow clearing the opposite  
jamb, then slid back and dropped into the sill glazing pocket. The  
removable interior stop is applied and, finally, an interior wedge  
gasket is installed. Sometimes this method is called “jiggle” or  
“wiggle” glazing because of the manipulation necessary to get  
the glass into place. Installation of the glass units from inside  
the building is desirable from a constructability standpoint, but  
performance is slightly reduced because dry metal-to-metal  
joints result at the removable stop at a point that should be  
airtight and watertight. Heel beads will improve performance,  
and some systems incorporate an extra gasket to form an air  
seal between frame and glass. Installation of spandrel areas  
may have to be from the exterior because of limited access  
space on the interior side.  
• Structural silicone glazing \(SSG\)\: This system depends on adher-  
ing the glass to the frame or other glazing with a bead of sili-  
cone. Outer silicone weather seals supplement the structural  
seal. Unitized systems are frequently structural silicone glazed  
because it allows work from one side only, and is highly reliable.  
Two-sided SSG can be completed in the field with either pres-  
sure plate or jiggle-glazed frames in the other direction. Four-  
sided SSG should only be done under controlled conditions in a  
factory. If the frames are stick-built, then an aluminum subframe  
is adhered to the glass at the factory, and the resulting assembly  
is mechanically fastened to the main frame in the field.  
Water management for nearly all curtain walls uses pressure-  
equalized rainscreen technology.  
the mullion. The static pressure test is more common, but might  
give an optimistic result because the test procedure may suck  
glass against gaskets, making a better than expected seal.  
Dynamic testing, which may help reveal leaks that would occur  
under the buffeting conditions of variable winds, is particularly  
effective at operable sash.  
• Thermal performance is tested according to AAMA 501.5, “Test  
Method for Thermal Cycling of Exterior Walls.” U-values should  
be specified by the design team. Condensation performance is  
extrapolated from the thermal performance.  
Standardized levels of performance for curtain-wall systems are  
not commonly available in the industry, but standardized test pro-  
cedures and ranges of typical values are relatively well known.  
• Structural capacity of a curtain wall is tested according to ASTM  
E 330, “Standard Test Method for Structural Performance of  
Exterior Windows, Curtain Walls, and Doors by Uniform Static  
Air Pressure Difference.” The loads required for the project are  
determined by code, normally ASCE-7. For large projects,  
boundary-condition wind-tunnel testing may be performed to  
establish more accurate wind loads. Wind-tunnel testing may  
lower the average field loads and may also help identify hot  
spots of higher loads.  
• Air infiltration is tested according to ASTM E 283, “Standard Test  
Method for Rate of Air Leakage Through Exterior Windows,  
Curtain Walls, and Doors,” with values of leakage tested at  
certain differential pressures. Common leakage values are  
0.06 cfm per sq. ft. of wall area. Common test pressures are  
1.56 psf \(25 mph wind\) for low-rise, 6.24 psf \(50 mph\) or 10 psf  
\(63 mph\) for mid-rise construction, and 12 psf \(70 mph\) and up  
for high-rise or monumental buildings. Pressures are also  
selected at approximately 20 percent of the structural loads.  
• Water leakage is tested according to ASTM E 331, “Standard  
Test Method for Water Penetration of Exterior Windows, Curtain  
Walls, and Doors by Uniform Static Air Pressure Difference,”  
and AAMA 501.1, “Standard Test Method for Metal Curtain Walls  
for Water Penetration Using Dynamic Pressure.” Test pressures  
usually match those for air infiltration. The architect should  
establish leakage criteria—frequently acceptable are water  
amounts appearing on interior sills small enough to not run off  
Manufacturers of curtain walls typically provide generic details for  
installation. Adjacent construction is frequently shown as a  
hatched single line. Detail the curtain-wall frame in project-specific  
assemblies.  
• Mullions and covers\: Standard rectangular commercial mullions  
are available from manufacturers in widths from 2 to 3 in. \(2-1/2  
in. is most common\), in depths from 1 to 12 in. from the inside  
face of glass. Snap-on mullion covers are available in many  
shapes, and can be easily customized because they have limited  
impact on the performance of the curtain wall. Large external  
mullion covers, however, may seriously affect the thermal per-  
formance of systems without complete thermal breaks.  
• Interface with adjacent assemblies\: Seal the air barrier of the  
curtain wall to the wall air barrier; likewise the rainscreen. Use  
subsill flashing at the base of the wall, detailed to seal to the air  
barrier. At the interface with barrier walls, provide a dual line of  
sealant.  
• Weather barriers\: Detail the curtain-wall installation so that the  
line of weather barrier \(if required\) extends uninterrupted  
across the gap at the perimeter of the curtain wall by connecting  
to the inner shoulder of the glazing pocket.  
• Anchoring\: Curtain walls are typically anchored to each floor  
slab or spandrel beam. Every other floor is a gravity and wind  
anchor, with a wind-only slip anchor in between. The anchorage  
scheme should be determined by the architect and structural  
engineer, and indicated on the drawings. Unitized panels com-  
monly have a wind and gravity anchor at each floor, with slip  
joints providing wind load resistance at the stack joints. Anchors  
for stick systems are commonly mounted on the side of beams  
or slab edge. Anchors for unitized panels are commonly mount-  
ed in pockets on the top of slabs. Manufacturers have a variety  
of proprietary anchors that allow three-dimensional adjustment  
and fixed or slip connection.  
• Movement\: Because curtain walls span floor-to-floor from slab  
or spandrel beam, they must accommodate differential move-  
ment of the spandrel beams and lateral drift of the structure  
along with the large thermal movement inherent with aluminum.  
Curtain-wall heads \(particularly at a strip curtain wall\) often are  
located at shelf angles and must accommodate movement typi-  
cally in the range of 1/2 in. from above.  
• Thermal continuity\: Detail the curtain wall to maintain a line of  
thermal insulation in the same plane as in the tested configura-  
tion, and as intended by the curtain-wall manufacturer.  
• Firestopping\: The intersection of a floor slab with a curtain wall  
requires firestopping.  
• Spandrel/shadowboxes\: Where the curtain wall is in front of a  
structure or areas that otherwise need to be opaque, spandrel  
glass or a shadowbox is used. Spandrel glass is composed of

single or insulated glass units, with the inside layer opacified by  
a film or fired-on ceramic frit. Reflective coating can be used. If  
an insulated glass unit is used, the second or third surface can  
be coated with patterned ceramic frit. Shadowboxes are more  
effective at blending spandrel areas with vision areas, especially  
if the back panel is reflective. As opposed to spandrel areas, the  
cavity inside the shadowbox is typically vented and weeped, but  
there are differences of opinion among experts and manufactur-  
ers regarding venting of the cavity. Vented airspaces shift the  
thermal enclosure to the back of the curtain wall and may result  
in thermal short circuits and uncontrolled condensation; and, in  
time, the inside surface may get dirty. Unvented shadowboxes  
may overheat, especially with clear glass. Note that heat buildup  
within shadowbox cavity can cause off-gassing of sealants and  
plastics of some materials and may deform composite materials  
and insulation. The manufacturer can assist with an analysis.  
• Parapets and copings\: When the curtain wall extends past the  
edge of the roof, the curtain wall becomes a parapet. Special  
care must be taken to stop air movement through hollow mul-  
lions and to control the thermal conduction to the exterior. Most  
curtain-wall systems are not designed for exposure to weather  
from the back side, but they can be modified to properly func-  
tion. If a spandrel of shadowbox is used for an opaque parapet,  
the back of the curtain wall can be furred, sheathed, and water-  
proofed with roofing base flashing. Transparent or translucent  
parapets can be provided by terminating the roof base flashing  
at a mullion approximately 8 in. above the roof. Special precau-  
tions must be taken because the back surface of a curtain wall  
is typically not watertight. Curtain walls extending past the  
conditioned space into the parapet can create thermal short-  
circuits and uncontrolled condensation. Provide air seals to  
prevent moisture-laden air from contacting cold surfaces, both  
inside the mullions and between the mullions and the roof struc-  
ture. Foam-in-place sealants work well. Because of the inherent  
thermal break with extending a curtain wall to form a parapet,  
it is best avoided in cold climates. Thermal analyses can check  
insulation and design of air/vapor barriers to verify that tem-  
peratures never reach dew points. Extend roof base flashing or  
membrane flashing across the top of the parapet and seal it into  
the glazing pocket. Cap with brake metal coping, which is also  
sealed into the glazing pocket.  
Whatever the quality of the curtain wall, ultimate performance  
depends on proper installation. The intersection of the curtain wall  
frame with surrounding walls has always been a difficult detail,  
and light modern materials have exacerbated the problem.  
Stick systems require a high level of quality control in the field, as  
there are numerous extremely important and detailed steps in the  
assembly of the curtain wall.  
• Anchors and mullions must be installed to allow movement.  
• Joints at the mullion intersection must be made airtight and be  
properly compartmentalized for pressure-equalized systems.  
• Glazing gaskets must be cut precisely and the corners sealed.  
• Pressure plates must be torqued to specified values to com-  
press the gaskets sufficiently for watertight performance.  
Even unitized systems require attention to detail during field instal-  
lation but because more assembly takes place in the factory there  
are fewer crucial requirements. The most important point is the  
flashing of the four-way intersection.

Design professionals have been challenging the traditional  
assumptions regarding the support and glazing of curtain walls.  
These walls have frequently been used at large lobbies, atria, and  
other monumental-scale spaces, but they have also been used to  
enclose entire buildings. More sophisticated, lightweight, and visu-  
ally transparent wall support structures have been developed,  
including the use of architectural exposed structural steel trusses,  
trusses with cable and rod tension members, tension grid sup-  
ports, glass mullions and support fins, the use of the glass itself as  
part of the load-resisting components, and other innovative solu-  
tions. The glazing of these systems frequently depends on point  
support devices or patch fittings at corners, and silicone butt  
glazing, resulting in a frameless, visually uninterrupted surface.  
Specialized curtain walls require extremely close coordination  
between the architect, structural engineer, manufacturer, installer,  
and other contractors. In particular, if the glass is used structur-  
ally, there are relatively few engineers qualified to perform the  
analysis and few installers who understand the difficult sequenc-  
ing required to temporarily hold the wall in place until all compo-  
nents can be tensioned to design values. The following are issues\:  
• Heat gain/loss and glare control can become sizable problems  
with large areas of glass. Shading and specialized glass are  
required.  
• The adjacent building structure may need to accommodate large  
loads resulting from suspending walls that might otherwise be  
gravity-loaded to a foundation or to resist large tension loads.  
• The interface with surrounding walls, copings, and roofs may  
need to accommodate significant movement within and between  
the systems.

Exterior doors allow access and egress, while maintaining a sepa-  
ration between the interior and exterior environments. Doors must  
also provide security from intrusion, and may need to be fire-rated.  
Doors and frame types include\:  
• Hollow metal doors and frames\: These comply with performance  
standards in the Hollow Metal Manual , by Hollow Metal  
Manufacturers Association \(HMMA\) and NAAMM and the Steel  
Door Institute \(SDI\).  
• Residential prehung doors\: These include insulated, metal-  
skinned, fiberglass-skinned, and wood doors in wood or metal  
frames. Refer to AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440-05,  
“Standard/Specification for Windows, Doors, and Unit  
Skylights.” Drafts and heat loss from residential doors present  
a larger problem than for commercial buildings. It is likely that  
the comfort of the occupants will be affected to a greater  
degree, and that the energy loss will result in a greater impact  
on the overall energy usage.  
• Aluminum and glass entrance doors\: This type includes door-  
frames of extruded aluminum with glass or insulated aluminum  
infill panels. Standardized test procedures are available to  
evaluate many specialized performance criteria, including  
acoustic isolation, blast resistance, forced-entry resistance, and  
safety impact. Refer to AAMA.  
• Specialty entrance doors\: Tempered safety-glass doors, frame-  
less with patch fittings, with top and bottom rails or with solid  
metal frames, are available on a custom basis for monumental  
entrances. Refer to GANA.  
Entrance doors are not limited by IBC or ADAAG for operating force  
for accessibility, primarily because the low force is not sufficient to  
keep the doors closed against wind pressures. However, this  
should be verified, as some local codes do have maximum operat-  
ing forces.  
It is good practice to provide automatic doors at entrances to  
public buildings to allow for universal access. Overhead concealed  
and exposed operators, as well as operators concealed in the floor,  
are available. Push-button, card key, or motion sensor activators  
can be used.  
Thresholds must provide a continuous walkable surface, with mini-  
mal vertical offsets to allow for universal access that is free from  
tripping hazards and impediments to wheeled traffic. The lack of  
vertical offset can create an opportunity for water to be pushed  
under doors by wind pressure, so compensate with generous cano-  
pies or overhangs and ensure that the paving slopes away. Trench  
drains with closely spaced grilles immediately in front of doors will  
also stop water.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Regardless of the quality of the door and frame, ultimate perfor-  
mance depends on proper installation. The intersection of the  
doorframe with surrounding walls has always been a difficult  
detail, and light modern materials have exacerbated the problem.  
ASTM E 2112-01, “Standard Practice for Installation of Exterior  
Windows, Doors, and Skylights,” establishes a variety of methods  
for quality installations of prehung residential doors. The architect  
may exceed the standard installation practices for more durable  
and dependable service. In particular, it is recommended to coordi-  
nate waterproofing, dampproofing, and flashing below grade with  
the threshold.  
Door installation must be detailed as appropriate for the generic  
wall assembly types, which include\:  
• Barrier walls\: Seal the doorframe to the barrier. Use a subsill  
flashing to avoid introducing water into the wall. For massive  
barrier walls such as precast concrete, head flashing may be  
required to ensure that water seepage does not get behind the  
window.  
• Drainage plane walls\: Provide the primary seal of the doorframe  
to the water-resistant drainage plane, and an outer seal in line  
with the wallcovering. The flashing below the threshold should  
extend past the doorframes and be lapped by the water-resistant  
drainage plane in the wall. Ensure continuity of the air barrier,  
wherever it is located in the wall assembly.  
• Drained cavity walls\: Provide the primary seal of the doorframe  
to the waterproof inner line of protection, and an outer seal to  
the outer wallcovering. The flashing below the threshold should  
extend past the doorframes and be lapped by the water-resistant  
barrier in the wall. Ensure continuity of the air barrier if it is not  
located at the inner line of protection.  
• Pressure-equalized \(PE\) rainscreen walls\: Use doorframes that  
incorporate PE rainscreen technology. Seal the air barrier of the  
doorframe to the wall air barrier; likewise for the rainscreen.  
The flashing below the threshold should extend past the door-  
frames and be lapped by the air/vapor barrier in the wall.  
• Air and vapor barriers\: Detail the door installation so that the  
line of the air barrier and/or vapor barrier \(if required\) extends  
uninterrupted across the gap at the perimeter of the door-  
frames.

• Window and Door Manufacturers Association \(WDMA\)  
Keep the following in mind when working with glass entrance  
doors\:  
• Consult applicable codes for safety requirements, glass size,  
thickness, and tempering.  
• Frameless 1/2-in. glass doors are available in clear, gray, or  
bronze tints, in sizes up to 60 by 108 in. Frameless 3/4-in. glass  
doors are available only in clear tint in sizes up to 48 by 108 in.  
• Consult manufacturers’ data on structural adequacy for  
required loads and for frames and transom bars reinforcement.  
• Aluminum doors and frames are available in all standard alumi-  
num finishes in sizes up to 6 by 7 ft.  
• Frameless doors may not permit adequate weather stripping.  
The use of frameless doors in exterior walls in northern cli-  
mates should be evaluated for energy efficiency and comfort.  
• Refer to all applicable codes, standards, and regulations for  
specific requirements for doors that must be accessible.

Roofing generally falls into two broad categories, steep slope and  
low slope. Selecting the appropriate roof assembly is dependent on  
many factors, including\:  
• Initial and lifecycle cost  
• Reliability  
• Substrate material  
• Structural capacity of the deck  
• Fire resistance  
• Environmental conditions including wind speed and seasonal  
weather \(hail, snow, and rain\)  
• Building height  
• Future access  
• Roof-mounted equipment  
• Complexity of the building geometry  
• Number of penetrations  
• Thermal performance  
• Construction sequencing  
• Building codes  
building, and a warranty only provides a road map to fixing a leak  
after it has occurred.  
Selecting the steep slope roof system is dependent on many factors,  
including initial and lifecycle costs; appearance; reliability; historical  
accuracy; structural capacity of the deck; fire resistance; wind speed;  
resistance to weather conditions including hail, rain, and snow; and  
building codes.  
Selection recommendations include\:  
• Consider light-colored, highly reflective roofs to reduce heat  
island effect in cities and, in warm climates, energy costs for the  
building.  
• In areas susceptible to forest fires, select noncombustible roof-  
ing such as concrete or clay tiles, or slate.  
• Consider recycled material content, life span, reuse options,  
embodied energy, distance to source, and other sustainable  
criteria.  
Steep slope roofing consists of four major components\: the roof  
covering; the weather barrier; the structural roof deck; and flash-  
ing at the edges, transitions, and penetrations.  
Flashing is an additional component of steep slope roofing assem-  
blies used at edges, transitions, and penetrations, to provide a  
watertight assembly. Flashing has traditionally been sheet metal,  
but elastomeric sheets are replacing some sheet metals for the  
purpose of flashing, particularly at penetrations. Sheet metal,  
especially when installed in long lengths, must be allowed to  
expand and contract independent of the roof deck and the roof  
covering. Running lengths of sheet metal should be installed with  
Steep slope roofing is generally designated as roofing with slopes  
greater than 3 in 12. Steep slope roofing is a water-shedding roof,  
typically comprised of many small overlapping units; as such, it is  
not a continuous waterproof membrane. The slope must be steep  
enough so that water runs off by gravity and cannot be pushed  
uphill by wind or capillary action. Some steep slope roof assem-  
blies can be installed at slopes less than 3 in 12 in accordance with  
the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Steep slope roofing is typically a ventilated or “cold” roof design,  
with insulation below the roof deck and the surface temperature of  
the roofing system near outdoor conditions. The insulation and  
weather barrier are typically located at the ceiling below the attic  
cavity.  
Steep slope roofing assemblies can be designed as a compact  
“warm” or “unvented” roof design with insulation between the  
shingles or covering and the structural deck. Evaluate the manu-  
facturer’s recommendations for compact roof design, because  
there may be concerns about the possibility of elevated surface  
temperatures causing premature failure of the assembly. Forensic  
investigation has shown that roof orientation \(south versus north  
slopes\) and material color have a major impact on surface  
temperature.  
Steep slope roofing is most commonly used for residential and light  
commercial construction. Although it provides long-term perfor-  
mance at competitive costs, it is generally cost effective for use on  
large commercial buildings because it does not provide a platform  
for roof-mounted HVAC or window cleaning equipment, nor is it as  
easy to maintain or replace on tall buildings. For buildings with  
large footprints, steep slope roofing can result in excessive inter-  
nal volume that is not usable.  
Roof warranties are offered by most manufacturers of synthetic  
roof shingle materials, but not for natural products such as slate  
and wood. However, these warranties are primarily a means for  
manufacturers to limit their liability, rather than to protect an  
owner. Furthermore, some products are promoted as having  
extremely long warranty periods, but the fine print limits coverage  
to replacement of defective materials on a prorated cost basis to  
the original owner. Defective installation is not covered, nor is  
there any value available for the cost of labor to make repairs.  
Therefore, design professionals should read the warranty careful-  
ly, and not rely on it as a basis for product selection. In the end,  
keep in mind that no piece of paper will keep water out of a  
Steep slope roofing is almost always installed over a weather bar-  
rier that provides temporary protection until the roofing is installed  
and serves as a second layer of defense against water penetration.  
The traditional material for weather barrier is building felt.  
Considering the relatively low material cost of felt, it is recom-  
mended to invest in heavier grades, double coverage, or both, to  
provide more robust performance, especially at shallower slopes.  
Self-adhering \(peel-and-stick\) modified bituminous weather barrier  
provides an increased level of moisture protection. This type of  
weather barrier is frequently used to seal seams and is flexible  
enough to form to complicated configurations. Self-adhering mem-  
branes are typically recommended for use at edges, eaves, rakes,  
valleys, hips, ridges, crickets, and other difficult areas. It is impor-  
tant to consider that modified bituminous membranes are vapor  
barriers, and in cold or mixed climates their placement should be  
carefully designed to avoid trapping moisture in the roof assembly.  
Slip sheets are necessary under metal roofs to keep them from  
sticking to the felt weather barrier. Some modified bituminous  
membranes may come with a surfacing that can be used under  
metal roofing. The barrier should also be a high-temperature bar-  
rier in these locations due to the increased temperatures under  
metal roofs.  
Ice dams are a problem for many shingle roofs in cold climates. The  
first defense against ice dams is to detail the roof framing to allow  
full thickness of insulation to the edge of the roof, and proper vent-  
ing to ensure that the roof deck stays cold. Additional protection  
can be provided by installing a modified bituminous membrane at  
eaves and up the roof surface past the location of the building wall.  
clips and not be directly nailed. Where flashing is installed at points  
that interrupt the flow of water, it must be carefully detailed to  
control and redirect the water. Crimped dams at valleys and folded  
crickets are two examples.  
Roof decks under steep slope roofing are almost always plywood  
or oriented strand board \(OSB\) panels. Proper installation of the  
panels is important, especially the spacing between panels to allow  
expansion without telegraphing through the shingles.  
In some commercial construction, steep slope roofing may be  
installed over metal decking or, occasionally, concrete planks. In  
these cases, board insulation is typically installed over the metal  
or concrete deck, and a nailable panel is added over the insulation.  
Up to slopes of 6 in 12, the panels may be simply screwed through  
the insulation layer. With steeper slopes, it may be necessary to  
install wood sleepers to avoid pulling the fasteners downslope,  
depending on the weight of the roof covering and the thickness of  
the insulation.  
Low slope roofing is generally designated as roofing with slopes at  
or less than 3 in 12. Low slope roofing is typically comprised of a  
continuous waterproof membrane. Low slope roofs are not flat;  
most have a minimum slope of 1/4 in. in 12. Many low slope roof  
assemblies can be installed at slopes from 3 in 12 up to vertical in  
accordance with manufacturers’ recommendations. Low slope  
roofing is typically designed as a compact “warm” roof design,  
with insulation between the roof covering and the structural deck  
and with no ventilation.

Low slope roofing provides long-term performance at competitive  
costs and a platform for roof-mounted HVAC and window cleaning  
equipment. Low slope roofing is relatively easy to maintain and  
replace on tall buildings. This is no panacea, however, as any roof-  
ing will suffer from poor design and installation. With proper detail-  
ing and installation low slope roofing assembly can deliver 20 or  
more years of service with minimal maintenance.  
Low slope roofing consists of five major components\: the roof  
covering; the insulation with a cover board; a vapor barrier \(if  
present\) and sheathing to support the vapor barrier over the metal  
deck; the structural roof deck; and flashing at the edges, transi-  
tions, and penetrations. Everything above the roof deck constitutes  
the roofing system.  
• Perlite\: Manufactured from expanded minerals and binders,  
perlite insulation is noncombustible and has moderate thermal  
resistance, good strength, and excellent compatibility with most  
roofing materials. The perlite will absorb moisture.  
• Wood fiberboard\: Manufactured from wood or cane fibers and  
binders, wood fiberboard shares many traits with perlite. Its  
disadvantage is that it can burn and degrades when wet.  
• Insulating concrete\: Portland cement or gypsum with light-  
weight aggregates \(possibly with foaming agents\), and usually  
supplemented with expanded polystyrene, provide strength,  
thermal resistance, and no gaps, and readily produces a sloped,  
finished surface. Density is typically between 20 and 40 psf. The  
system inherently introduces moisture into an assembly that  
should be dry, thereby creating an opportunity for trapped mois-  
ture and resulting failures. Venting of the completed assembly is  
recommended, which may affect the interior ceiling plenum and  
create leaks. Careful control of the drying time before installa-  
tion must be maintained while also protecting the insulating  
concrete from precipitation.  
• Gypsum sheathing\: While not technically insulation, gypsum  
sheathing is a high-quality cover, providing a strong substrate  
for attaching the roof membrane, which is both fireproof and  
resistant to moisture. Preprimed boards are available for hot-  
asphalt applications.  
• Miscellaneous boards\: Other types of insulation include cellular  
glass, fibrous glass, mineral fiber, and others used for special-  
ized applications.  
• Composite boards\: Composite boards that combine two insula-  
tion materials laminated into one board are available; com-  
monly polyisocyanurate or polystyrene foam bonded to plywood,  
OSB, or gypsum sheathing.  
Insulation should be installed in at least two layers, with joints  
offset between the two. The offset joints reduce air leaks that  
waste energy and could result in condensation on the cold under-  
side of the membrane.  
Insulation is mechanically fastened, set in adhesive or hot asphalt,  
or ballasted. It is preferable to not have mechanical fasteners  
extend through the entire assembly to the bottom of the roof  
membrane because the anchors may puncture or abrade the mem-  
brane. Therefore, limit mechanical fasteners to the bottom layer of  
insulation and install subsequent layers with adhesive.  
Also, it is best to limit the size of insulation boards to 4 ft by 4 ft to  
reduce the size of cracks that may develop from shrinkage. Tapered  
insulation can be used to build up the roof slope and crickets.  
Provide a cover board over the insulation if the top layer is not a  
composite board or lightweight concrete. Cover boards are typi-  
cally gypsum sheathing, perlite, or wood fiberboard, to provide the  
physical rigidity and strength that most insulations do not possess.  
The cover board can count as the second layer of insulation.  
• The NRCA recommends a vapor retarder over concrete decks to  
protect the roof system from the effects of latent moisture.  
• An inverted roof membrane assembly places the roof membrane  
on the warm side of the insulation and, therefore, is an ideal  
system for control of water vapor in cold climates.  
• Vapor barrier membranes can be two- or three-ply built-up roof-  
ing, modified bituminous membranes, self-adhering peel-and-  
stick membranes, polyethylene sheets, or aluminum foils. It is  
best to select a membrane that will seal around mechanical  
anchors; or even better, select a membrane over which all sub-  
sequent layers of the assembly can be set in hot asphalt or other  
adhesive.  
• On a metal deck, a weather barrier board of gypsum sheathing  
or a thin layer of insulation may be required to provide a smooth  
substrate for the installation of the vapor barrier membrane,  
although some membranes can be installed directly on the  
metal deck.  
• At the perimeter of roof vapor barriers, it may be best to con-  
nect to wall air and vapor barriers. Otherwise, ensure that the  
vapor barrier at the perimeter keeps moisture out of the roof  
assembly. Detail penetrations to be vapor-tight, similar to  
details for the roof membrane.  
Roof insulation not only reduces the energy required to condition  
the building, it also helps to control condensation; provides a  
smooth substrate for the roof membrane; and can be used to slope  
the surface for drainage.  
The ideal low slope roof insulation would be compatible with the  
membrane, adhesives, and substrates; be dimensionally stable and  
strong enough for anchorage, uplift, traffic, and impact; be fire-  
resistant; have a high and stable thermal value; and not be  
affected by moisture. No single material embodies all of these  
attributes, however, so the use of two or more layers with comple-  
mentary properties is recommended.  
• Polyisocyanurate foam\: This is one of the most common com-  
mercial roof insulation boards. It is fire- and moisture-resistant,  
compatible with nearly all membranes and adhesives, and has  
excellent thermal properties. A more rigid cover board is recom-  
mended. Use the more conservative, aged R-value to evaluate  
long-term thermal performance.  
• Polystyrene foam\: Both extruded and expanded types are avail-  
able. Polystyrene has a very high R-value and is unaffected by  
wetting; however, it is combustible and may require a weather  
barrier of gypsum board to comply with building codes.  
Moreover, polystyrene is difficult to install with hot asphalt  
adhesives and may not have sufficient rigidity for mechanical  
fasteners. Nevertheless, it is very commonly used in ballasted  
systems and inverted roof membrane assemblies \(extruded  
type\). A cover board is recommended to isolate asphalt-based  
membranes. Polystyrene foam may be recycled.  
Roof decks for low slope roof assemblies must support the gravity  
loads from snow, rain, and rooftop equipment, and must resist  
wind uplift loads that may be greater than the gravity loads. The  
deck also is frequently sloped to provide drainage, and must be  
stiff enough to ensure that deflection does not result in localized  
water ponding.  
Metal deck, concrete, and plywood are the three most common  
roof deck materials, but other materials are available. Concrete  
and poured gypsum decks must be cured before installing roof  
covering.

Water vapor moves through low slope roof assemblies under two  
methods\: air leakage and water vapor diffusion. Just as in walls, air  
leakage can carry much more moisture than diffusion. Use offset  
joints in multiple layers of foam insulation and air seals at edges and  
penetrations to limit the flow of cold interior air to the underside of  
the membrane, where it will likely condense. For buildings in cold  
climates with high interior winter humidity, the vapor drive may be  
strong enough that a vapor barrier on the warm underside of the  
insulation may be required, in addition to air sealing.  
Additional water vapor control recommendations include\:  
• Most roof membranes are also vapor barriers, so adding a  
separate vapor barrier on the inside face may trap moisture in  
the insulation. Therefore, avoid a separate vapor retarder,  
unless it is actually required.  
Similar in use to flashing for steep slope roofing, flashing includes  
additional components for low slope roofing systems and is used  
at edges, transitions, and penetrations to provide a watertight  
assembly. Particularly at penetrations, traditional sheet metal has  
been replaced with elastomeric sheets and preformed cones.  
Sheet metal moves more with temperature change than roofing.  
Therefore, it is better to avoid embedding long lengths of sheet  
metal directly into the roof membrane. At gravel stops and other  
similar conditions, constrain the movement of the metal by nailing  
in two rows, with nails 3 in. apart.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR HORIZONTAL ENCLOSURES  
Roof membrane manufacturers produce standards and recommen-  
dations for their roof assemblies. These standards will typically  
include details for standard conditions, such as penetrations,  
edges, and terminations. Modifications to these details, such as  
increased roof slope and the use of tapered edge strips at the base  
flashing can extend the service life of the roof and should be con-  
sidered by the design professional.  
Many assemblies have specific detailing and installation proce-  
dures that are required to obtain a 20-year warranty. These details  
should be adhered to even if the warranty is not required. No sin-  
gle low slope roof assembly solution is appropriate for every roof-  
ing condition.  
Design guidelines and recommendations include\:  
• Consider light-colored, highly reflective roofs, to reduce the heat  
island effect in cities and, in warm climates, energy costs for the  
building.  
• Avoid gravel-coated or ballasted systems on buildings in high-  
wind areas where stone fragments may become projectiles,  
causing collateral damage by breaking out windows.  
• Consider recycled material content, life span, reuse options,  
embodied energy, distance to source, and other sustainable  
criteria.  
• Consider planted green roofs to slow water runoff, reduce the  
heat island effect, and increase thermal performance.  
Design guidelines include\:  
• Consider deflection of deck, particularly at long spans. Deflection  
may be sufficient to negate the roof slope. If the deflection cre-  
ates a low area, ponding may increase the deflection, progres-  
sively increasing until failure. Structural engineers should check  
for this failure mode.  
• It is typically less expensive to slope the roof deck and use  
tapered insulation to create crickets in small areas. If the roof  
deck is planned as a future floor and is flat, then tapered insula-  
tion should be used to build up slope.  
• In addition to primary drains, the roof must have provisions for  
secondary drainage. Overflow scuppers are the most reliable,  
but piped secondary drains are an option in most jurisdictions.  
Requirements for piped secondary drains may mandate that the  
size be twice as large as the primary drains to avoid clogging, or  
that the rainwater conductors discharge near an entrance so  
that building personnel will be alerted to the fact that the roof is  
not draining properly. The height of the scupper and the resulting  
impounded water should be checked against the structural  
capacity of the deck.  
Light-colored, reflective, and high-emissivity roof systems reduce  
cooling loads and heat island effect in urban areas. Refer to the  
ENERGY STAR listing at www.energystar.gov .  
Designs of roof edge copings, gravel stops, and horizontal roof  
edges require calculations for material thickness that lead to sat-  
isfactory flatness and minimize corrosion. The standard, as devel-  
oped by ANSI SPRI ES-1, takes into account the structural integrity  
of the substrate that anchors the edge, wind resistance of the edge  
detail, and materials specified.  
The roof system frequently also functions as the weather barrier  
on the top of the building. Roofs over concrete roof decks may  
function as a weather barrier, but the roof membrane or a vapor  
barrier is more frequently chosen as the air barrier. Some manu-  
facturers will not warrant their membrane when it is to be used  
as an air barrier, particularly mechanically fastened single-ply  
membranes.  
Positive drainage increases roof life and is mandated at 1/4 in. in  
12 in most codes and systems, although some large government  
and corporate owners require 1/2 in. in 12. All surfaces of the  
finished roof should be sloped sufficiently so that no ponding  
occurs 48 hours after a rain.  
For most fire-rated roof assemblies, a Class A roof covering and  
listed insulation is acceptable, but verify with the roofing manufac-  
turer and authority having jurisdiction. Note that unlike floor  
assemblies, penetrations through roofs do not need to be fire-  
stopped, except in portions of roofs where openings are not per-  
mitted \(such as near firewalls\).  
Some products are promoted as having extremely long warranty  
periods, but they lack in-place proven performance to back up  
these claims. Design professionals should read the warranty provi-  
sions carefully and not rely too heavily on the warranty as a basis  
for product selection.  
Note that warrantable roof assemblies and details reflect a com-  
promise chosen by the manufacturer between dependable service  
and a low initial cost, to remain competitive in the open market.  
Therefore, do not automatically assume that the offer of a war-  
ranty implies the highest quality.

Wood shingles and shakes are cut from wood species that are  
naturally resistant to water, sunlight, rot, and hail \(i.e., red cedar,  
redwood, and tidewater red cypress\). They are typically installed in  
the natural state, although stains, primers, and paint may be  
applied.  
Nails must be hot-dipped in zinc or aluminum. Nail heads should be  
driven flush with the surface of the shingle or shake but never into  
the wood.  
The weather barrier and sheathing should be designed to augment  
the protection provided by the shingles or shakes, depending on  
roof pitch and climate. A low-pitched roof subject to wind-driven  
snow should have solid sheathing and an additional weather barrier.  
Use self-sealing peel-and-stick modified bituminous membrane  
weather barrier at eaves, valley, rake, and other detail areas.  
Modified bituminous weather barrier is a vapor retarder, so is it not  
recommended for continuous application where the weather bar-  
rier needs to breathe.

tiles are available in a larger number of colors, including bright  
blues, greens, reds, and oranges.  
• Concrete\: Concrete tiles are pressed in molds under high pres-  
sure. The synthetic oxide compounds color the surface. Tiles are  
sometimes painted, which may fade with time.  
Tiles are typically available in three profiles, flat, barrel, and  
S-shaped. Barrel and S-shaped are also called mission tiles .  
• Flat\: These are sized approximately 10 by 13 up to 13 by 20 in.  
Flat tiles may be very simple, requiring a doubled shingled over-  
lap, or may be interlocking, with approximately a 3-in. head  
overlap. Tiles may be fluted on the back to reduce weight, or  
lugged to hang on battens.  
• Barrel\: Barrel tile sizes are typically 16 by 8, 19 by 10, or 18 by  
12 in., punched for one hole.  
• S-shaped\: These tiles are approximately 10 by 13 up to 13 by 20  
in. S-shaped tiles are essentially the pan and cover portions of  
barrel tiles in one piece.  
• Weather barrier\: Tile roofs in areas of high rain or wind-driven rain  
are likely to allow some water under the tiles and therefore the  
weather barrier provides the final defense against water intrusion.  
Therefore, the weather barrier must be more robust and detailed  
more thoroughly than in some other steep roofing systems. The  
minimum weather barrier is a double layer of No. 30 unperforated  
asphalt saturated felt except single coverage allowed at slopes  
over 20 in 12. In comparison to the cost of the tiles, the felts are  
inexpensive; consider using heavier No. 45 or 60 felts or hot-  
mopped bitumen sheets. For all edges and detail areas, such as  
eaves, valleys, rakes, and crickets, it is recommended to install a  
self-sealing, peel-and-stick modified bituminous weather barrier.  
The modified bituminous membrane provides an additional level of  
protection by sealing around the nails and stopping migration of  
water under loose felts. Self-sealing membrane is especially  
important for protection against ice dams in cold climates.  
Modified bituminous membranes are vapor retarders and should  
not be used across the entire roof substrate if a continuous vapor  
retarder is not desired.  
• Flashing\: Sheet metal flashing embedded in the tile should be  
minimum 24-oz. copper or lead-coated copper or 26-gauge stain-  
less steel, fabricated to allow differential thermal movement.

Tile roofs can make a long-lasting, durable roof if well detailed and  
constructed. Roofing tiles are available in either clay or concrete  
and in a large number of profiles, sizes, colors, and textures. All  
tiles absorb moisture and, generally, the more porous, the less  
strong and durable the tile. Concrete tile is generally more porous  
than clay, and may require a sealer. The sealer may require reap-  
plication that is inconsistent with tile’s otherwise durable quality.  
Typical 1/2-in.-thick tiles weigh approximately 10 psf, with propor-  
tional increases for thicker tiles.  
Tile is made from two basic materials, clay and concrete\:  
• Clay\: Clay tiles are formed from natural material, so color uni-  
formity is dependent on the uniformity of the raw clay—unless  
glazed. Unglazed tile weathers only slightly over time. Glazed

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR HORIZONTAL ENCLOSURES  
• Wood nailers\: Although the simplest and least expensive method  
to install tiles is to nail them directly to the wood deck, nailers can  
help secure the tiles and provide drainage. For tiles with lugs,  
horizontal battens with a 1/2 in. space every 48 in. is recom-  
mended. Mission tiles may require vertical nailers of 2 by 3’s or 2  
by 4’s, spacing to suit tiles plus nailers at ridges and hips. For  
maximum reliability and long-term performance it is recommended  
to install vertical nailers at 24 in. on center with horizontal nailers  
to suit the tiles. This lattice arrangement allows maximum drainage  
and drying below tiles. Nailers should preservative treated.  
• Tiles\: Barrel tiles are typically secured with a single nail each.  
Flat and S-shaped tiles typically are installed with two nails.  
Nailing may be reduced in the field of the roof depending on  
slope and wind conditions; verify with local code. Some tiles,  
especially barrel tiles, are laid in cement.  
• High-wind areas\: For high-wind areas, refer to The Concrete  
and Clay Tile Installation Manual , published by the Florida  
Roofing, Sheet Metal, and Air Conditioning Contractors  
Association and the Roof Tile Institute.  
Slate roofs are extremely durable, sometimes lasting 75 or 100  
years. Due to the expense and durability of the slates, it is important  
to select all supporting and accessory materials for a similar life  
span. Use the following as selection guidelines\:  
• Commercial standard\: The quarry run of 3/16-in. thickness;  
includes tolerable variations above and below 3/16 in.  
• Textural\: A rough-textured slate roof with uneven butts. The  
slates vary in thickness and size, which is generally not true of  
slate more than 3/8-in. thick.  
• Graduated\: A textural roof of large slates. Greater variation in  
thickness, size, and color.  
• A square of roofing slate\: A number of slates of any size suffi-  
cient to cover 100 sq ft with a 3-in. lap. Weight per square\: 3/16  
in., 800 lb; 1/4 in., 900 lb; 3/8 in., 1100 lb; 1/2 in., 1700 lb; 3/4  
in., 2500 lb.  
• Standard nomenclature for slate color\: Black, blue-black, mottled  
gray, purple, green, mottled purple and green, purple variegated,  
and red. These should be preceded by the word “unfading” or  
“weathering.” Other colors and combinations are available.  
• Durability\: Durability of slates is rated for their expected service  
life according to ASTM C 406 as\: S1 for over 75 years, S2 for 40  
to 75 years, or S3 for 20 to 40 years.  
• Weather barrier\: The minimum weather barrier is a single layer  
of No. 30 unperforated asphalt saturated felt with double cover-  
age up to 20 in 12 slopes. Use No. 45, 50, or 60 felts under tex-  
tural or graduated slates. In comparison to the cost of the slates,  
the felts are inexpensive; consider using heavier No. 45 or 60  
felts. For all edges and detail areas, such as eaves, valleys, rakes,  
and crickets, it is recommended to install self-sealing, peel-and-  
stick modified bituminous underlayment. The modified bituminous  
membrane provides an additional level of protection by sealing  
around the nails, stopping migration of water under loose felts,  
and is especially important for protection against ice dams in cold  
climates. Note that the modified bituminous membrane is a vapor  
retarder and it should not be used across the entire roof sub-  
strate if a continuous vapor retarder is not desired.  
• Nail fastener\: Use large-head, hard copper wire nails, cut cop-  
per, cut brass, or cut yellow metal slating nails. Each slate is  
punched with two nail holes. Use nails that are 1 in. longer than  
thickness of slate. Cover all exposed heads with elastic cement.  
In dry climates, hot-dipped galvanized nails may be used.  
• Flashing\: Sheet metal flashing embedded in the slates should be  
minimum 20 oz. copper or lead-coated copper, fabricated to  
allow differential thermal movement.  
• Imitation slates\: Slates manufactured from recycled tires, min-  
eral fiber, portland cement, and a variety of other proprietary  
materials are available, generally at a lower cost than true slate.  
However, the appearance varies greatly and is rarely the same  
as true slate, and the expected service life may not be as long.

Mineral-fiber cement tiles should be applied to nailable decks only.  
For plywood decks with rafters spaced 20 in. or less, the plywood  
should be at least 1/2 in. thick. If rafters are spaced greater than  
20 in., 5/8-in. plywood is recommended. To fasten, use standard  
1-1/2 in. galvanized 11-gauge flat-head roofing nails with 3/8-in.  
heads. Flashing should be of a noncorrosive metal not lighter than  
28 gauge.  
When wood fibers are used the tiles are lightweight and can be  
used for reroofing as well as for new construction. They have  
excellent impact resistance and are easily sawn and nailed. As a  
richly textured, composite product, mineral-fiber tiles create an  
aesthetic similar to that of heavy cedar shakes, yet provide the fire  
protection associated with cementitious products. The portland  
cement is noncombustible and allows for Class A fire ratings, and  
the wood fibers provide excellent tensile strength and a light  
weight when compared to standard concrete tiles.  
Ceramic slate tiles combine the look of natural slate with the fired-  
in strength and durability of ceramic tile. These tiles have the  
thickness, texture, and appearance of older slate but at a fraction  
of the weight and cost. They are impervious to freeze-thaw cycles,  
fire, moisture, and efflorescence.  
A built-up bituminous roofing assembly is composed of a base  
sheet attached to the roof substrate, two or more reinforcing felt  
ply sheets, and a surfaced cap sheet. Asphalt and coal tar are the  
primary bituminous materials used for built-up roofing. Coal tar  
bitumen has a history of maintaining functional characteristics for  
a very long period, but there are some questions regarding safety  
from coal tar fumes, and this is generally more expensive. As the  
heated mopping bitumen fuses with the saturating bitumen in the  
roofing felts, the layers are welded together. Surfacing compo-  
nents include aggregate, minerals, protective or reflective coat-  
ings, and smooth surface. Built-up bituminous roofing can be a very  
durable and high-quality roof, but requires more skill to install than  
some other assemblies. If the owner is willing to invest in frequent  
independent inspection of the roof, then a BUR is an excellent  
choice.  
Four types of asphalt and two types of coal tar are presently used  
as bitumen in built-up roofing assemblies. The grade of asphalt  
used for BUR systems should be appropriate for the slope of the  
roof. Backnailing of felts is recommended for built-up roofing  
whenever the roof slope exceeds 1/2 in 12. Aggregate-surfaced  
built-up roofing should not be used on slopes exceeding 3 in 12.

completely covered \(coated\) with asphalt. Saturated and coated  
roofing felts are generally factory-coated on both sides and sur-  
faced on one or both sides with fine mineral sand or other release  
agents to prevent adhesion inside the roll prior to application.  
Prepared roofing felts have been saturated and coated with talc,  
mica, sand, or ceramic granules incorporated into the weather  
surface of the felts, both to provide weather protection and for  
decorative purposes. Reinforced flashing membrane consists of a  
glass-fiber base felt that is laminated with cotton, or glass-fiber  
fabric coated with asphalt. Rosin-sized sheathing paper is a rosin-  
coated building paper generally used in built-up bituminous roofing  
to separate felts from wood roof decking.

Reinforcing felts for BUR may be saturated, coated, or impregnat-  
ed with bitumen and are manufactured from both organic and  
inorganic materials. Organic felts are manufactured from the fiber  
of paper, wood, or rags. Saturated felts are saturated with asphalt  
or coal tar bitumen. Impregnated roofing felts are generally lighter  
Proper application temperatures are vital to the creation of a qual-  
ity built-up bituminous roofing assembly. Temperatures that are too  
high can lead to incomplete coverage, voids, and lack waterproof-  
ing qualities. Temperatures that are too low can lead to poor adhe-  
sion, high expansion properties, and low tensile strength.  
Bitumen can be heated at high temperatures for short periods of  
time without damage; in fact, they must be heated at high tem-  
peratures to achieve complete fusion and strong bonding of the  
plies. There is an optimum viscosity range and an optimum tem-  
perature range at the point of application that allow complete  
fusion, optimum wetting and mopping properties, and the desirable  
inter-ply bitumen weight called the equiviscous temperature \(EVT\).  
Excessive and prolonged heating of asphalt and coal tar products  
may have a deleterious effect on the quality of the product.  
Surfacing protects the bitumen and felts of a built-up bituminous  
roof from direct sunlight and weather exposure, and may provide  
other properties such as fire resistance or reflectivity. Surfacing  
types include aggregate, smooth surfacing, and mineral cap sheet.  
• Aggregate surfacing\: The aggregate in roofing serves as an  
opaque covering that improves the appearance and fire resis-  
tance of the roof and helps resist premature aging and damage  
from weather, temperature fluctuations, and ultraviolet rays.  
Aggregate also increases the wind uplift resistance of the roof  
membrane and permits much heavier application of bitumen  
than would otherwise be possible.  
• Smooth surfacing\: Built-up bituminous roofing may be left  
smooth, surfaced with a top coating of hot asphalt. Smooth  
surfacing should not be confused with a built-up membrane left  
unsurfaced \(exposed felts\). Smooth-surfaced built-up roofing  
should be specified only in those circumstances where aggre-  
gate-surfaced built-up bituminous roofing is impractical, such as  
when the slope of the roof surface exceeds 3 in 12, where the  
proximity of air-intake or exhaust equipment may cause loose  
aggregate, and where appropriate aggregate is not available.  
• Mineral-surfaced \(cap sheet\)\: Some areas of the country \(par-  
ticularly the far western and southern states\) use mineral-  
surfaced cap sheets as the final surfacing for built-up roofing  
membranes. These assemblies are similar to aggregate and  
smooth-surfaced except that a final layer of roofing material  
with a finished surface is installed on top of the multi-ply roof  
assembly. This assembly is not popular in colder climates, pri-  
marily because it requires phased construction of the final layer  
of roofing material.

Polymer-modified bituminous membrane roofing couples bitumen  
and polymers with various modifiers to form a membrane system  
with improved properties. Modifiers include atactic polypropylene,  
styrene-butadiene-styrene, and styrene-butadiene-rubber. The  
modifying compounds impart improved flexibility, cohesive strength,  
toughness, and resistance to flow at high temperatures. The seams  
are sealed by torch-welding or with hot asphalt. Thickness ranges  
from 40 to 160 mils. Modified bituminous membranes of varying  
quality are manufactured by many companies. The design profes-  
sional should carefully investigate and understand the characteris-  
tics and details of the assembly to obtain the desired quality.  
For some systems, a base sheet is first fastened to the deck or  
insulation cover board. In the hot-mopped system, the membrane  
is constructed similar to a built-up roof with hot asphalt mopped  
between the plies. Self-adhered sheets have a factory-applied  
asphalt-adhesive coating on the underside. The protective sheet is  
peeled away to stick the membrane to the roof deck. Torch-applied  
membrane systems have a factory-applied coating of modified  
asphalt on the underside of the sheet, which is melted with a pro-  
pane torch to make the sheet adhere.  
Because the base ply is airtight, application of the cap sheet may  
be delayed until construction is nearly complete, thereby avoiding  
damage caused by ongoing construction work.  
Reinforcing materials for polymer-modified bitumen membranes  
include plastic film, polyester mat, glass fiber, felt or fabric, and  
metal foils, embedded within or laminated onto the modified bitu-  
men sheet. Membranes may be surfaced with liquid coatings,  
metallic laminates, or ceramic or mineral granules to enhance  
resistance to weathering, ultraviolet rays, or fire or to improve  
appearance. Terminations at roof edges, parapets, and other flash-  
ings may be torch-applied, hot-mopped, or self-adhered. Laps are  
formed as the sheet is being applied.

Elastomeric membrane roofing and thermoplastic membrane roof-  
ing assemblies are both types of single-ply membrane roofing.  
Single-ply membrane roofing uses large sheets that are joined into  
a continuous roof membrane. In these assemblies the seams and  
flashing may be vulnerable to defects in workmanship, thus com-  
prise a primary weakness of the system. Single-ply membranes are  
also generally less resistant to physical abuse and cannot as eas-  
ily be resurfaced as other types.  
Single-ply membranes are available in two types\: thermoset and  
thermoplastic. Thermoset materials cure during manufacture and  
can only be bonded at seams with adhesive. Ethylene propylene  
diene monomer \(EPDM\) is the most common thermoset mem-  
brane; chlorosulfonated polyethylene \(CSPE\) and polyisobutylene  
\(PIB\) are also available, but not as common. Thermoplastic mem-  
brane roofing materials are uncured and, therefore, are capable of  
being hot-air-welded or solvent-welded. Polyvinyl-chloride \(PVC\)  
and thermoplastic-polyolefin \(TPO\) are two common thermoplastic  
membranes.  
Single-ply membranes may be installed using three methods\:  
• Loose-laid ballasted assemblies\: Loose-laid assemblies are the  
least expensive and require the least skills of the installer. There  
are, however, a number of disadvantages. First, membrane is  
susceptible to puncture from ballast when maintenance staff  
walks across the roof. Second, leaks are very hard to find  
because the water is free to travel horizontally within the insula-  
tion before appearing on the interior, and the membrane is  
covered with stones. Third, the loose ballast is problematic  
because it can be moved around on the roof by the wind, leaving  
some areas of the membrane unsecured and ballast may also fly  
off the roof as dangerous projectiles. Size and weight of ballast  
should be designed for the specific project site, with increased  
weights at perimeter and corner zones. Specially designed  
lightweight concrete roof pavers that are cast for use as roof  
ballast may be used in place of regular aggregate ballast for  
some or the entire roof—refer to Figures 11.426 and 11.471.  
Avoid ballasted roofs in hurricane areas and on high-rise struc-  
tures. The ballast can be a light color, but is generally not as  
reflective as white single-ply membrane roofing.  
• Fully adhered assemblies\: Fully adhered assemblies are gener-  
ally the most expensive of the three applications and offer the  
highest-level of performance. Fully adhered assemblies may use  
non-reinforced or reinforced sheets, which generally take lon-  
ger to wear through. Leaks are relatively easy to find because  
an area of wet insulation usually forms immediately below the  
gap in the membrane.  
• Mechanically attached assemblies\: Membranes for mechanically  
attached assemblies should be reinforced to resist the tearing  
forces generated by uplift. Because a relatively large amount of  
seaming is required, thermoplastic sheets are becoming more  
popular. The level of difficulty of finding leaks within mechani-  
cally attached systems is between the loose-laid and fully  
adhered systems.  
Membrane sheets and insulation are laid loose with the mem-  
brane secured at the perimeter and around penetrations only. The  
membrane is then covered with a ballast of river-washed stones  
\(typically 10 lb/sq ft\) or appropriate pavers. This system works  
efficiently with insulation approved by the membrane manufac-  
turer and on roofs with a slope not exceeding 2 in 12.  
A mechanically attached roof assembly is appropriate for roofs  
that cannot carry the loads imposed by ballasted roof assemblies.  
Assemblies are available with fasteners that penetrate the mem-  
brane, or that require no membrane penetration. The membrane is  
anchored to the roof using metal bars or individual clips, and it may  
be installed over concrete, wood, metal, or compatible insulation.  
Fully adhered membrane assemblies are not limited by slope,  
because the membrane is secured to the substrate with bonding  
adhesive and by mechanically fastening the membrane to the perim-  
eter and penetrations. This assembly is appropriate for contoured  
roofs and roofs that cannot withstand the weight of a ballasted  
assembly. The membrane can be directly applied to numerous types  
of roof deck surfaces including concrete and wood and may be  
compatible with insulation or protection board.  
Ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer \(EPDM\) membranes are typi-  
cally 30 to 60 mils in thickness, single-sheet roofing materials. The  
membranes are available either non-reinforced or reinforced with  
fabric. Seams in the membrane are spliced and cemented. EPDM  
membranes are highly resistant to degradation from certain  
chemicals, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation, and have excellent  
resilience, tensile strength, abrasion resistance, hardness, and  
weathering properties.  
EPDM membranes may be loose-laid, mechanically fastened, or  
fully adhered to either nailable or nonnailable decks. For loose-laid  
systems, ballast provides resistance against wind uplift forces.  
Field application of surfacing or coatings may enhance the weath-  
er-resistance properties, or may be simply aesthetic. Terminations  
at roof edges, parapets, and other flashings use material identical  
to the roof membrane material shaped to conform to the substrate  
and area being flashed.

Polyvinyl-chloride \(PVC\) membranes may be non-reinforced or  
reinforced with glass fibers or polyester fabric. The membranes  
are typically 45 to 60 mils in thickness. Seams are sealed by heat  
or chemical welding, and may require additional caulking. PVC  
membranes are resistant to bacterial growth, industrial chemical  
atmospheres, root penetration, and extreme weather conditions.  
PVC membranes also have excellent fire resistance and seaming  
capabilities.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR HORIZONTAL ENCLOSURES  
ASTM Standard D-4434 categorizes PVC materials into several  
types and classes, depending on the construction of the sheet  
material\:  
• Type I\: Non-reinforced sheet  
• Type II, Class I\: Non-reinforced sheet containing fibers  
• Type II, Class II\: Non-reinforced sheet containing fabrics  
• Type III\: Reinforced sheet containing fibers or fabrics  
PVC membranes may be loose-laid, mechanically fastened, or fully  
adhered to either nailable or nonnailable decks. For loose-laid sys-  
tems, ballast provides resistance against wind uplift forces. Some  
PVC membranes have a factory-applied coating to enhance weather  
resistance or aesthetics. Field application of the coatings may be an  
option, and is dependent on the membrane manufacturer.  
KEE membranes are a relatively new roofing type on the market  
similar to PVC. Basically it is an improved PVC roof with plasticiz-  
ers for better reflecting high-heat, such as the reflective heat from  
solar panels.  
Thermoplastic-polyolefin \(TPO\) membranes are blended from  
polypropylene and ethylene-propylene rubber polymers, and may  
include flame retardants, pigments, UV absorbers, and other  
modifiers. Membrane sheets are available reinforced and non-  
reinforced in thicknesses from 40 to 100 mils. TPO membranes  
range from stiff and “boardy” to soft and flexible. Seams are heat-  
welded and may require additional caulking to protect wicking of  
the reinforcing. TPO is resistant to animal fats, some hydrocar-  
bons, and vegetable oils.  
TPO membranes may be loose-laid, mechanically fastened, or fully  
adhered. Some membranes are white or light in color, or field  
coatings may be applied.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR HORIZONTAL ENCLOSURES  
Fluid-applied roofing assemblies may be applied at ambient tem-  
peratures or heated in kettles. Most of them have some sort of  
reinforcing fabric that is applied along with the liquid component.  
Fluid-applied roofing used over existing roofs is not generally  
accepted as a “membrane,” but rather as a coating.  
Acrylic latex and urethane are the two main types of cold liquid-  
applied roofing. Acrylic latex refers to a family of products that use  
water-based polymers and cure by water evaporation. Liquid-  
applied urethane roof coatings are chemically cured to form an  
elastomeric membrane. Because these coatings are applied as  
liquids, installation is relatively simple, even for roofs with irregu-  
lar geometries or multiple penetrations. For assemblies using a  
reinforcing fabric, a coating is applied to an acceptable surface.  
While the coating is still wet, a layer of polyester or fiberglass is  
laid into it, followed by an additional layer of coating. Subsequent  
layers may be added as desired or necessary.  
Fluid-applied roofing is appropriate for new construction but is  
most commonly used as enhancements or for repairs to existing  
roofs, including modified bituminous roofs and built-up roofs.  
The advantages of fluid-applied roofing are that it conforms very  
well to irregular surfaces, is easily applied, and comes in various  
colors. However, it is sensitive to the skills of the installer, and is  
best used in sloped roof situations.  
Fluid-applied roofing may also be used under rigid insulation and  
ballast for further protection.

Most commonly, hot fluid-applied membranes are composed of  
rubberized asphalt applied at 150 to 210 mils in two coats with a  
reinforcing sheet between the layers. Although the membrane has  
limited puncture resistance, because it is most often applied  
directly to a concrete substrate and protected by insulation, punc-  
ture resistance is less critical. The membrane is self-healing to  
minor punctures, has crack-bridging ability, is relatively forgiving of  
rough substrates, and can be protected shortly after installation.  
Moreover, fluid-applied membranes allow for easier penetration  
flashing, so they are particularly suited to complicated roof shapes  
with many penetrations.  
and tear from people walking or working on the roof. In a protected  
membrane roof \(sometimes called the inverted or insulated roof  
membrane assembly , or IRMA \), a layer of extruded polystyrene  
insulation board protects the membrane. Extruded polystyrene is  
the only material generally approved for this application because it  
does not absorb moisture. This roofing system is best used in  
extreme climates, where it is important to protect the membrane  
from the elements, or where the rooftop will receive heavy use  
\(e.g., plaza or parking deck applications\).  
In a typical roofing assembly, the waterproof membrane \(built-up,  
modified bitumen, or single-ply\) is applied over the insulation, which  
is on top of the substrate and/or structural deck. The membrane in  
this situation is exposed to temperature extremes, as well as wear  
Varying approaches have been taken to vegetated roofing design,  
so-called green roofing. The type of assembly selected will depend  
in part on the job conditions, including climate, plant community  
desired, and load-bearing capacity of the roof deck. Green roof  
assemblies are compatible with both conventional and protected  
roof membrane \(PRM\) waterproofing systems. All assemblies will  
include the following characteristics\:  
• Protection of the waterproofing membrane from root and bio-  
logical attack  
• Protection of the waterproofing membrane from physical abuse  
and accident  
• Base drainage layer  
• Separation layer, to prevent fine-grained engineered soils from  
fouling or clogging the drainage layer system  
• Engineered soil, to support the vegetation  
Some waterproofing membranes do not require supplemental root  
protection. Assemblies 6 in. and thinner are referred to as exten-  
sive; assemblies 12 in. and thicker are referred to as intensive .  
Optional components can be incorporated, among them\:  
• Irrigation  
• Slope-stabilizing elements  
• Root-reinforcement elements  
• Enhancements to retain rainfall moisture  
• Air layers to dehumidify the insulation layer \(some PRM systems\)  
• Self-contained modules  
• Ballasts to resist wind uplift  
Most engineered soils intended for green roof use are manufac-  
tured from lightweight mineral aggregates. These materials typi-  
cally have wet densities between 60 and 90 lb./cu ft., measured  
according to ASTM E2399.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR HORIZONTAL ENCLOSURES  
Green roof assemblies can be classified into five categories\:  
• Category I\: Single-layer assemblies usually installed with a  
fabric or foam mat to provide physical protection and improve  
drainage. The overall thicknesses of these assemblies are rarely  
greater than 4 in. These assemblies are associated with pitched  
roof installations. They also offer the least expensive option for  
roof greening.  
• Category II\: Two-layer assemblies in which the engineered soil  
is placed over an efficient geocomposite drainage layer. A com-  
mon variation utilizes a drainage layer that can also retain some  
water. To reduce plant stress during drought conditions, the  
drainage layer should not be thicker than 1 in. Typical overall  
assembly thicknesses range from 3 to 6 in. These are probably  
the most commonly encountered extensive assemblies in the  
United States.  
• Category III\: Two-layer assemblies in which a highly permeable  
coarse granular material is used to create the drainage zone.  
Typical overall assembly thicknesses range from 4 to 8 in.  
Compared to a Category II assembly of comparable thickness, a  
Category III assembly would be markedly more drought-toler-  
ant and accommodate a broader plant selection.  
• Category IV\: Similar to Category III assemblies but with a  
deeper drainage layer to accommodate base \(bottom-up\) irriga-  
tion methods. The minimum thickness for this assembly is 6 in.  
• Category V\: These assemblies involve the use of a water reten-  
tion panel that is filled with coarse granular material. As in the  
Category III and Category IV assemblies, a surface layer of  
engineered soil is placed over the granular layer and separated  
from it by a filter fabric. This assembly introduces an air layer at  
the bottom of the profile. The minimum thickness for this system  
is 6 in.  
Category IV and V systems are irrigated and are most frequently  
associated with intensive applications. Irrigation enhances land-  
scape design opportunities, and in warm climates can also  
enhance cooling effects. These assemblies are well represented in  
deep plaza landscapes that can support large perennial plants and  
trees.  
been developed. Also, electrical techniques are available that make  
it possible to locate even small leaks with pinpoint accuracy.

• Reinforced vegetated mats

• Modules planted in the nursery

Vegetated roofing provides three important environmental benefits  
including\:  
• Prolong the life expectancy of the underlying waterproofing  
materials, which will reduce waste generation and the amount  
of embedded energy associated with the roof.  
• Restore a natural hydrologic balance to developed sites, includ-  
ing reducing flooding and promoting more effective water utili-  
zation by plants.  
• Improve the energy performance of buildings.  
The scale of the energy benefit will, of course, depend greatly on  
the climate; northern-temperate and semitropical climates will  
benefit most. When selecting green roof systems, ask the following  
questions\:  
• What contained materials are manufactured from recycled  
materials or, alternatively, are recyclable?  
• How durable is the combined waterproofing and green cover  
system likely to be? How can its longevity be enhanced?  
• To what extent can irrigation be eliminated through appropriate  
selection of the engineered soil, system configuration, and plant  
selection?  
The basic components, subsystems, and features for a building  
deck waterproofing system are the structural building deck or  
substrate to be waterproofed, the waterproofing membrane, pro-  
tection of the membrane, drainage, insulation, and wearing course.  
With appropriate precautions, vegetated roofs have been success-  
fully installed in combination with all major waterproofing system  
types. These membranes do not require supplemental root-protec-  
tion layers. Also, ASTM E2397 provides a standardized procedure  
to establish maximum combined assembly weights for use when  
determining dead loads.  
A critical part of all vegetated roof design is protection for the  
drains and flashings that is comparable to that offered by the  
vegetated cover elsewhere. The flashing, in particular, is typically  
the weak link in the overall roofing assembly. As a result, it is  
considered good practice to armor flashings with metal counter-  
flashing or to protect the it with “sacrificial” layers of membrane.  
Green roof techniques have been employed with great success in  
Europe for more than 40 years. In most German cities, for example,  
vegetated roofing is an indispensable part of the country’s urban  
runoff management and water treatment strategies. Very effective  
methods for protecting underlying waterproofing membranes have

The preferred substrate is reinforced cast-in-place structural  
concrete. Precast concrete slabs pose more technical problems  
than cast-in-place concrete, and the probability of lasting water-  
tightness is greatly diminished and difficult to achieve because of  
the multitude of joints that have movement capability and must be  
treated accordingly.  
The concrete used for the substrate should have a minimum den-  
sity of 110 lb./cu ft. and have a maximum moisture content of  
8 percent when cured.  
The underside of the concrete deck should not have an impermeable  
barrier. A metal liner or coating that forms a vapor barrier on the  
underside traps moisture in the concrete and destroys or prevents the  
adhesive bond of the membrane to the upper surface of the concrete.

The surface should be of sufficiently rough texture to provide a  
mechanical bond for the membrane, but not so rough as to pre-  
clude achieving continuity of the membrane of the specified thick-  
ness across the surface.  
The concrete should be cured a minimum of seven days and aged a  
minimum of 28 days, including curing time, before application of the  
liquid-applied membrane. Curing is accomplished chemically with  
moisture and should not be construed as drying. Liquid or chemical  
curing compounds should not be used unless approved by the  
manufacturer of the liquid-applied membrane as the material may  
interfere with the bond of the membrane to the structural slab.  
The membrane should be protected from damage throughout con-  
struction. Protection board should be applied after the membrane  
is installed. The proper timing of application after placement of the  
membrane is important and varies with the type of membrane  
used. Follow the manufacturer’s printed instructions.  
A minimum cast-in-place concrete substrate slope of 1/8 in 12  
should be maintained. Slope is best achieved with a concrete  
structural slab. If topping slabs are used, create a 3/4-in. depres-  
sion at edges to avoid tapering fill to a feather edge. Drains should  
be designed with a wide flange or base as an integral part. The  
drain base should be set flush with the structural slab.  
Drainage should be considered a component of the total system,  
from the wearing surface down to the membrane, including use of  
multilevel drains.  
Drainage at the wearing surface is generally accomplished in one  
of two ways\:  
• Using an open-joint and pedestal system, which permits the  
rainwater to penetrate rapidly down to the membrane level and  
subsurface drainage system.  
• Using a closed-joint assembly designed to remove most of the  
rainwater rapidly by slope surface to drains and to allow a small  
portion to infiltrate to the membrane.  
A drainage course of washed, round gravel or prefabricated drain-  
age composite should be provided above the protection board,  
over the membrane. This permits water to filter to the drain and  
provides a place where it can collect and freeze without damaging  
the wearing course.  
pedestals comprise a common wearing course. A prefabricated  
drainage composite under a thickset mortar bed supporting masonry  
units helps resist freeze-thaw damage to the wearing course by  
expediting water flow down to the subsurface drainage system.  
Joints in which movement is anticipated should be treated as  
expansion joints. Various compression seals are available that can  
be inserted into a formed joint under compression. Most of these,  
however, are not flush at the top surface and could, therefore, fill  
up with sand or dirt.  
Wet sealants are the materials most commonly used in moving  
joints at the wearing surface level. Dimension A is the design width  
dimension, or the dimension at which the joint will be formed. The  
criterion normally used for determining this dimension with sealants  
capable of plus 25 percent movement is to multiply the maximum  
expected movement in one direction by 4. Generally, this is expected  
to be about 3/4 of the total anticipated joint movement; but if there  
is any doubt, multiply the total anticipated joint movement by 4. It is  
better to have the joint too wide than too narrow. Dimension B \(seal-  
ant depth\) is related to dimension A and is best established by the  
sealant manufacturer. Generally, B is equal to A for widths up to 1/2  
in., 9/16 in. for a 5/8-in. width, and 5/8 in. for 3/4-in. and greater  
widths. This allows some tolerance for leveling sealants. Joints over  
a soft backer rod should be limited to 1/4 in. to support high loads.  
High-shore hardness sealant should be used for plaza surfaces.

Membranes for horizontal plaza waterproofing include hot fluid-  
applied membranes, cold fluid-applied membranes, single-ply  
sheet membranes, modified bituminous membranes, built-up  
membranes, bentonite clay membranes, cementitious coatings,  
and others. Many are similar to the roofing membranes of the  
same composition.  
Some membranes can tolerate a dead-flat substrate but many  
require a slope of approximately 1/4 in. per foot. If possible, the  
substrate should always be pitched no matter what the membrane.  
Fluid-applied membranes are preferable for complicated plazas  
with many penetrations and details. Hot fluid-applied roofing is a  
popular system for plazas.  
Leakage detection can be a significant problem when the mem-  
brane is not bonded to the structural slab, or when additional layers  
of materials separate it from the structural slab. Therefore, only  
membranes that can be bonded to the substrate should be used.  
The membrane should be applied under dry, frost-free conditions on  
the surface, as well as throughout the depth of the concrete slab.  
When the membrane is turned up on a wall, it is preferable to  
terminate it above the wearing surface to eliminate the possibility  
of ponded surface water penetrating the wall above the membrane  
and running down behind it into the building.  
Penetrations should be avoided wherever possible. For protection  
at critical locations, pipe sleeves should be cast into the structural  
slab against which the membrane can be terminated by flashing  
onto the pipe sleeve.  
Treatment at reinforced and non-reinforced joints depends on the  
membrane used.  
Two concepts can be considered in the detailing of expansion joints  
at the membrane level\: the positive seal concept, directly at the  
membrane level, and the watershed concept, with the seal at a  
higher level than the membrane. Where additional safeguards are  
desired, a drainage gutter under the joint could be considered.  
Flexible upward support of the membrane is required in each case to  
provide watershed-type drainage. Expansion joint details should be  
considered and used in accordance with their movement capability.  
• The positive seal concept entails a greater risk than the water-  
shed concept, as it relies fully on positive seal joinery of materials  
at the membrane level, where the membrane is most vulnerable  
to water penetration. However, the precision required to achieve  
this is not always possible, so this concept is best avoided.  
• The watershed concept, even though it requires a greater height  
and more costly concrete forming, is superior in safeguarding  
against leakage, as it has the advantage of providing a monolithic  
concrete water dam at the membrane level. However, if a head of  
water rises to the height of the materials joinery, this concept  
becomes almost as vulnerable as the positive seal concept.  
Therefore, drainage is recommended at the membrane level.  
Insulation should be located above the membrane but not in direct  
contact with it. Insulation is typically extruded polystyrene for  
water resistance and from 40 to 100 psi, as required to support  
loads on a plaza.  
A concrete slab could be placed soon after the membrane, protec-  
tion board, drainage course, and insulation, if required, have been  
installed. It would serve as protection for the permanent water-  
proofing materials and insulation below, provide a working plat-  
form for construction traffic and storage of materials \(within  
weight limits\), and serve as a substantial substrate for the place-  
ment of the finish wearing course materials.  
Drains should be designed with a wide flange or base as an inte-  
gral part. The drain base should be set flush with the structural  
slab. Vehicular supporting drains generally require additional  
weepholes drilled into them.  
One recommended treatment of reinforced concrete joints in the  
structural slab is to apply a double layer of membrane over the crack.  
This type of detail is, however, quite limited and implicitly relies on  
the membrane’s crack-bridging capability. An alternative approach is  
to prevent the membrane from adhering to the substrate for a finite  
width centered on the joint or crack by means of a properly designed  
compatible bond-breaker tape.  
Because the joints are not held together with reinforcing steel,  
some movement, however slight, should be anticipated and pro-  
vided for, as the liquid-applied membrane has limited capability to  
take movement.  
The major requirements for the wearing course are a stable  
support of sufficient strength, resistance against lateral thrust,  
adequate drainage to avoid ponding of water, and proper treatment  
of joints. Stone or precast concrete pavers with open joints on  
Gaskets and flexible preformed sheets lend themselves better to  
absorbing large amounts of movement. Such materials, when used  
at an expansion joint, must be joined to the liquid-applied mem-  
brane, therefore the watershed concept should be used.

There are four types of metal roofing, in two major categories. The  
first category is the traditional metal roofing, which needs continu-  
ous structural deck support and is sometimes called architectural  
metal roofing. The second category is structural metal roofing,  
which is capable of spanning over open purlins. Structural metal  
roofing includes  
• Standing seam  
• Bermuda  
• Batten seam  
• Corrugated or formed sheet metal  
Standing seam roofing may be installed on slopes as gentle as 1/4  
in 12. Because of the architectural appearance of the roof system,  
it is more commonly used on steeper roof slopes, allowing the  
panels to be seen as part of the overall design.  
The spacing of seams may vary to suit the architectural style of the  
facility. Formed sheets \(used with metal building systems\) have  
seam spacing set by locations of punched holes in the structural  
framing members.  
Two methods of forming a standing seam are used\: the pan method  
and the roll method. In the pan method, the top, bottom, and sides  
of the individual sheets are preformed to allow locking together at  
each edge. Seams at the top and bottom of each sheet are called  
transverse seams . In the roll method, a series of long sheets are  
joined together at their ends with double flat-lock seams. These  
field-formed seams can be executed either manually or with a  
seaming machine \(a wheeled electronic device that runs along the  
sheet joint forming the seam\). In either method, cleats \(spaced as  
recommended by the manufacturer\) are formed into the standing  
seam. Seam terminations are usually soldered.

To allow for expansion and contraction movement in roof panels,  
some manufacturers set movable cleats into a stationary panel clip  
system, particularly for structural standing seam metal roofing.  
Note that the cleat must be anchored to a rigid substrate to limit  
rotation of the clip that constrains movement. If mounted over

insulation, provide a layer of plywood or OSB board or provide the  
manufacturer’s large anchoring plate to distribute the load over a  
large area.  
The Bermuda roof may be used for roofs having a slope greater  
than 2-1/2 in 12. Wood framing must be provided as shown in  
Figure 11.439. Dimension \(“D”\) and gauge of metal will depend on  
the size of sheet used.  
Bermuda roof is applied beginning at the eave. The first pan is hooked  
over a continuous cleat. The upper portion of the first and each  
succeeding pan is attached, as shown in detail 2 of Figure 11.439.  
Cleats spaced on 8-in. centers are nailed to batten, as in portion A  
of detail 2. All cross seams are single-locked and soldered except  
at expansion joints. Cross seams should be staggered. Expansion  
joints should be used at least every 25 ft and formed as shown in  
detail 3 of Figure 11.439.  
Batten seam roofing may be applied on slopes of 3 in 12 or greater.  
If the surface to receive the roofing is other than wood, the battens  
should be bolted into place. All batten fasteners must be counter-  
sunk into battens.  
The spacing of the wood battens may vary within reasonable limits  
to suit the architectural style and scale of the building, but the  
recommended maximum distance is 20 in. between battens. Care  
should be taken to space the battens in such a manner that waste  
of metal is held to a minimum.  
Sheets are formed into pans with each side turned up 2-1/8 in. A  
1/2-in. flange is turned toward the center of the pan. Pans are  
installed starting at the eave and are held in place with cleats  
spaced not over 12 in. o.c. Each pan is hooked to the one below it  
and cleated into place. After pans are in place, a cap is installed  
over the batten.

• Elevate base flashing and penetration flashing above any stand-  
ing water by using tapered edge strips. This detail is not  
required by most manufacturers but is a small amount of addi-  
tional dependability.  
• Provide crickets behind any interruption to the downhill flow of  
water such as at curbs, rails, and rooftop-mounted equipment.  
• Depress roof drains in large sumps approximately 3 to 4 ft.  
square and minimum 1-1/2 in. deep using tapered insulation to  
ensure that there is no standing water at drains. In cold cli-  
mates the underside of the drain body should be insulated with  
spray foam or else cold rainwater could cause condensation.  
The rainwater conductor should also be insulated, at least for a  
length sufficient to allow warming of drain water.  
• Verify that roof decks and the adjacent parapet wall or  
penetrating element are supported together. If they are  
not, then the base flashing must be detailed to accommo-  
date the anticipated movement.  
• Heavy pieces of roof-mounted equipment may need to  
have curbs mounted directly on the structural frame of the  
opening or the flutes of the metal deck may need to be  
blocked full to prevent crushing.  
• Base flashing should be carried up and across the top of  
parapets and curbs if possible to ensure that water does  
not get behind the base flashing and under the roofing. If  
the wall includes an air barrier or water-resistant drain-  
age plane, then connect base flashing to membrane.  
• Pitch pockets should be avoided. Detail penetrations  
through the roof using square or round shapes that are  
nearly perpendicular to the plane of the roof.  
• Detail lightning protection systems to provide adequate  
anchorage of air terminals and support of cables without  
penetrating roof membrane. Air terminals and cable at  
perimeter should be mounted to the inside face of the para-  
pet or on coping. Air terminals in the field should be  
adhered to precast concrete pavers. Cable running across  
the field of the roof should be supported on traffic walkways  
or pavers. Cable laying on bituminous roof membrane will  
eventually become embedded in the softened membrane.  
• Detail for replacement of the roof membrane. The mem-  
brane will need to be topped or replaced several times  
over the life of the building. It should be possible to install  
a new membrane under counterflashing and copings by  
removing and replacing the sheet metal without damage.  
• Joints and fasteners in sheet metal flashing are notori-  
ously susceptible to leakage after expansion and contrac-  
tion. Back-up sheet metal flashing with flexible membrane  
flashing.  
• Expansion joints and area dividers should be detailed  
above the plane of the roof.  
• Expansion joints should be specifically designed for the  
purpose and should have factory-fabricated intersections,  
tees, transitions, and intersections. Joints made in the  
field should be simple, straight butt joints.  
• Expansion joints fabricated from roof membrane do not  
maintain continuity of the expansion joint as well as facto-  
ry-fabricated systems.  
• Roof expansion joints must transition without leaks into  
vertical expansion joints in parapets and walls.  
• Expansion joints should be provided with a second line of  
defense, usually of a watertight vapor barrier membrane.  
Systems are available with secondary drains.  
• Area dividers are similar to expansion joints but do extend  
through the building structure. Area dividers are recom-  
mended at 200 to 300 ft. centers, located at ells, tees,  
changes of deck span, and other similar conditions where  
movement will damage the roof membrane. Note that  
many roof membranes are flexible enough to not require  
area dividers but the underlying cover board and insula-  
tion are not flexible and allowing space for their thermal  
movement will prevent telegraphing of the substrate.  
• Two primary sources for information regarding roof details  
is the NRCA Roofing and Waterproofing Manual , which  
covers most detail conditions for nearly every type of roofing  
system. NRCA details are nearly universally accepted. The second  
source for roofing details is the roof membrane manufacturer.  
• Note, however, that the manufacturer will publish details that are  
selected to be less expensive, sometimes resulting in lesser perfor-  
mance. Pitch pockets are an excellent example. For more depend-  
able details, review manufacturers’ data for details required for an  
extended 20-year warranty and compare against NRCA.  
• Note that details from NRCA or the manufacturer need to be  
customized to suit the specific project conditions.

• Always keep the front of the gutter lower than the back.  
• Use a minimum width of 4 in., except for canopies and small  
porches. The minimum ratio of depth to width should be 3 to 4.  
• Many custom shapes for gutters and downspouts are available;  
consult manufacturers’ design manuals.  
For more information on gutter sizing and details, refer to the  
Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National Association  
\(SMACNA\) Architectural Sheet Metal Manual. For more on rainfall  
intensity, sizing of gutter, and sizing and spacing of downspouts,  
contact the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National  
Association \(SMACNA\).  
Flashing is a thin material inserted in an assembly to direct the  
flow of water to the exterior. Flashing has traditionally been sheet  
metal, but modern elastomeric sheets are gaining in usage. Sheet  
metal flashing has traditionally been prone to leakage at joints. The  
joints can be soldered or welded, but this is not recommended for  
long lengths. In long lengths, joints have traditionally been water-  
proofed with sealant, but the joint design is not ideal and is also  
prone to fail. Therefore, it is recommended to back up the sheet  
metal flashing with a layer of an elastomeric membrane.

Important notes regarding the design of gutters and downspouts  
are as follows\:  
• Continuous gutters may be formed at the installation site with  
cold-forming equipment, thus eliminating joints in long runs of  
gutter.  
• Gutters and downspouts are available in aluminum, galvanized  
steel, copper, and stainless steel. Consult manufacturers for  
custom materials.  
• Girth is the width of the sheet metal from which a gutter is  
fabricated.  
• Although all joining methods are applicable to most gutter  
shapes, lap joints are more commonly used. Seal all joints with  
mastic or by soldering. Lock, slip, or lap joints do not provide for  
expansion.  
• Expansion joints should be used on all straight runs over 40 ft.  
In a 10-ft section of gutter that will undergo a 100° temperature  
change, linear expansion will follow these coefficients of expan-  
sion \(CE\) and movements\: aluminum\: CE, .00128, movement, .15  
in.; copper\: CE, .00093, movement, .11 in.; galvanized steel\: CE,  
.0065, movement, .08 in.  
The size and number of scuppers should be carefully determined to  
control ponding on roofs. Rectangular shapes convey more water  
\(per inch of water depth on the roof\) than round shapes. The  
performance of rectangular shapes approximates that of a broad-  
crested weir. Standard equations for channel flow are based on  
test models larger than typical roof scuppers. Downspout sizes  
normally are based on draining a given area of roof, but that flow  
rate may not pass through a scupper that has been sized to have a  
cross-sectional area equal to the downspout area.  
The scupper sizing procedures are\:  
• Determine the head \(H\) in inches of water \(typically 1 in. mini-  
mum by code\) at a point 6 ft back from the scupper opening.  
• Determine the roof drainage area in square feet \(SF\).  
• Using rainfall intensity in inches per hour \(IPH\) from a rainfall  
data table, determine discharge capacity in gallons per minute  
\(GPM\). GPM = SF of roof area × IPH × 0.0104. The constant  
is 7.48 gallons per cubic foot divided by 12 in. per foot divided  
by 60 minutes per hour\: GPM = \(0.0104\) IPH × SF.  
• Using H and the GPM, find the aggregate scupper length \(L\) in  
the Scupper Capacity in GPM \(Table 11.454\).  
• Select enough individual scuppers to satisfy the total GPM  
requirement and locate them proportionately.

b. Minimum clearance of 12 in. from cant strips and other curbs or

50 ft apart.  
c. A downspout of 7 sq in. minimum should be used, except for canopies  
or small porches.

Scuppers that empty into a gutter may be integrated with a roof  
edge. The scuppers are soldered into a formed gravel-stop fascia  
system. The suggested maximum scupper interval is 10 ft. The front  
rim of the gutter must be 1 in. below the back edge, and it should  
be below the nailers used to elevate the roof edge. The drip edge  
on the fascia should lap the back edge of the gutter a minimum of  
1 in. The gutter must be free to move behind the fascia.

The intersection of the roof and a wall or other vertical surface  
creates an area of special concern. The changes of plane and  
multiple materials at an area of drifting snow and large amounts of  
water make this detail particularly problematic. To address these  
issues, follow these guidelines\:  
• Detail the transition from roof membrane to base flashing in  
accordance with SMACNA and manufacturer’s instructions.  
• Elevate the base flashing detail out of most standing water by  
providing a continuous tapered edge strip.  
• Even though counterflashing is designed to protect against  
water intrusion by shedding running water, it is still recom-  
mended, to seal the top of base flashing to protect against water  
that gets under counterflashing and to serve as protection from  
drifted snow.  
• Use two-piece counterflashing, to allow for easier sequencing of  
construction and future repair or replacement of roof membrane.  
This is particularly important, as the roof membrane has a life  
span much lower than that of the wall assembly.  
• Back up all sheet metal flashing with a layer of flexible mem-  
brane or self-adhering peel-and-stick membrane.  
• When the roof deck is supported separately from the adjacent  
wall assembly, create a joint between the two, to allow for the  
anticipated differential movement.  
• If possible, avoid steps in elevation of counterflashing. Locate  
counterflashing at a high spot on the roof, and hold elevation. At  
doors to the roof, detail a step up and over curb with the door  
threshold at the elevation of the counterflashing receiver.  
11.462 It is typical to provide an approximately 36-in.-wide strip of self-  
adhering peel-and-stick membrane flashing at all detail areas, shingled  
with felt weather barrier.

11.469 Not for walls with internal drainage plain.  
11.470 Roof pavers provide a stable walking service on any flat roof  
surface and protect the roof membrane from wear and tear. Most  
membrane manufacturers also provide walkway protection mats or  
rolls as part of their roofing assemblies. Service walkways should follow  
the most direct route to equipment to avoid shortcuts by maintenance  
personnel. Walkways may be required to maintain the roof warranty.  
Coordinate required access with equipment.  
11.471 Ballast pavers are typically made from precast concrete with a  
nonskid texture on the surface. Use membrane protection sheet as  
recommended by roofing manufacturer.

• Where building expansion joints occur, they must extend through  
the roof assembly. Maintaining weathertightness, while allowing  
movement, especially in low slope roofing is difficult. It is rec-  
ommended that the expansion joint include a redundant inner  
waterproof membrane. Some manufacturers provide the inner  
layer with outlets to be piped to drains.  
• It is best to elevate the expansion joint assembly with insulated  
metal curbs above the line of the roof membrane.  
• Expansion joint assemblies with shop drawings and factory-  
fabricated intersections, transitions, and other unusual details  
provide higher quality than those fabricated on-site.  
• Elastomeric bellows systems are functional and relatively inex-  
pensive. Shop- or factory-fabricated metal cover assemblies are  
more resistant to physical abuse.

Low slope roofs provide inexpensive space to locate building  
mechanical equipment and other systems. The equipment must be  
supported in a manner that maintains a watertight roof and allows  
maintenance of both the equipment itself and the roof membrane.  
Once equipment is located on the roof, it frequently requires  
screening, which then results in more supports. Equipment sup-  
ports include\:  
• Curbs support equipment\: These are inexpensive and keep the  
equipment low. The space within the curb often has opening for  
ducts or forms a plenum. It may be difficult to isolate the sound  
of the equipment when a curb is used.  
• Rails\: These are essentially linear curbs that allow water to  
continue to drains under large equipment or long runs of ducts  
or pipes.  
• Dunnage\: This is a grid of structural steel elevated above the  
roof on columns that provides a platform for the equipment.  
Dunnage is a good choice for large amounts of equipment and  
when acoustic isolation is desired.

# ELEMENT B\: SHELL EXTERIOR HORIZONTAL ENCLOSURES  
Roof openings such as skylights, scuttles, and vents must be  
detailed with care, because they will be exposed to the same  
external factors as the roof assembly itself. These factors include  
wind pressure, both positive and negative, which acts on the fram-  
ing and/or glazing; rainwater penetration; live loads from snow  
and ice; dynamic loads from impact; daily cycles of thermal expan-  
sion and contraction; drainage of water and melting snow; and  
abuse from maintenance personnel. In addition, measures must be  
specified to keep people from falling through these openings.  
Insulated glass units have a laminated glass inner light and tem-  
pered or heat-strengthened outer light.  
Framed skylights require somewhat greater mullion widths when  
glazed with acrylics in order to accommodate the expansion and  
contraction characteristics of plastics. For economy, tinted acrylics  
should be limited to 1/4-in. thickness. A combination fiberglass  
sheet and aluminum frame system with high insulating value and  
good light diffusion can be a cost-effective alternative. Domed  
acrylic glazing is almost self-cleaning, as the sloped shapes facili-  
tate rain-washing of the surface.  
Gaskets are especially subject to degradation from solar ultravio-  
let rays. Excessive expansion and contraction of acrylic glazing can  
cause “rolling” of the gasket between metal framing. Small valleys  
created at the bottom of the sloped glazing and the horizontal glaz-  
ing cap will hold water, which increases the chance of gasket  
breakdown and subsequent water infiltration.  
Skylights provide daylight to interior spaces and can reduce depen-  
dence on electrical lighting. In passive solar designs, skylights are  
used to admit direct solar radiation, enhancing space heating, and  
when vented properly, to induce convective airflow, reducing cool-  
ing loads through natural ventilation.  
Skylights are available as units \(which are shipped to the site ready  
to be installed\) or as framed assemblies of stock components  
\(which arrive fabricated for site assembly\). Both fixed and hinged  
skylights are manufactured. The hinged variety can be opened  
manually or by remote control devices for venting. Frames are  
typically mounted on a built-up fabricated or site-built curb, with  
integral counterflashing; they can be assembled with or without  
insulation.  
Self-flashing skylight units are available with or without curbs.  
Those without curbs are intended only for pitched roof assemblies  
and are not recommended for roof assemblies with finished spaces  
below.  
Framed skylight assemblies are custom-designed by manufactur-  
ers to meet the necessary wind, roof, and dead loads of the  
assembly itself. When a skylight is pitched beyond a certain angle,  
it must be designed to resist environmental factors, as does a  
curtain-wall assembly. Roof drainage for rainwater and stormwa-  
ter can limit skylight dimensions. Many skylights are face-sealed as  
a barrier system, but some are available as a pressure-equalized  
rainscreen system. Condensate gutters are needed in the body of  
the skylight assembly and around its perimeter. Gutters should be  
designed to evaporate collected water or be drained to the building  
plumbing system. Condensate drains through the skylight curb,  
common to many systems, violates the air barrier, resulting in  
energy losses and possible condensation.  
Finishes for aluminum frame components are available as mill fin-  
ish, clear anodized, duranodic bronze or black, acrylic enamel, and  
fluorocarbon.  
In determining the desired form and size of the skylight unit/  
assembly, consideration should be given to\:  
• Environmental conditions, including orientation and winter and  
summer solar penetration angles at the site  
• Prevailing wind direction and patterns  
• Precipitation quantity and patterns  
• Adjacent topography and landscaping \(shade trees, etc.\)  
• Coordination with the HVAC system  
• Use of shading, screening, or light reflecting/bouncing devices  
• Views desired relative to view obstructions \(streetlights\)

Skylights can introduce too much uncontrolled light, especially in  
areas where video screens and computers will be used. Skylights  
also can allow excessive heat build-up. To mitigate these issues\:  
• Select extent of skylight, glazing, and shading devices to balance  
the gains of daylighting against heat gain.  
• Select glass with low-E coatings, tint, reflective coatings, frits,  
or combinations to lower the solar heat gain coefficient.  
• Approximately 40 to 50 percent visible light transmission in a  
skylight will appear as bright as vertical glazing with 60 to  
70 percent visible light transmission.  
• Shading devices such as louvers, grilles, and shades should be  
added to control direct sun. Movable systems, particularly if fully  
automated to track the sun, are more effective than fixed sys-  
tems, for controlling glare while maximizing daylighting.  
The heart of a well-designed skylight lies in the detailing of frames,  
glazing, and sealant systems. The thickness, size, and geometric  
profile of all glass and acrylic glazing materials should be carefully  
selected for compliance with building codes and manufacturers’  
recommendations. The following glazing materials are considered  
resistant to impact and breakage and are generally approved by  
codes \(listed in descending order of cost\)\:  
• Formed acrylic with mar-resistant finish  
• Formed acrylic  
• Polycarbonates  
• Flat acrylic  
• Laminated glass  
• Insulated glass units  
Frames or screens to protect glazing from impact, fire, or forced  
entry may be designed into the skylight assembly. To avoid forced  
entry, a framed skylight should include deterrents to disassembling  
the framing, removing the snap-on cover, and melting the glazing  
\(acrylics can easily be burned with a torch\). Metal security screens  
may be required.

• Two-sided structural silicone-glazed \(SSG\) assemblies have  
pressure plates or glazing stops on the mullions that run parallel  
to the slope, and structural silicone glazing on mullions running  
across the slope. Because the SSG has no mullion cover above  
the plane of the glass, no water is trapped to cause potential  
leaks or stains from the evaporated water. Two-sided SSG sys-  
tems are recommended for most framed skylights.  
• Four-sided structural silicone glazed assemblies provide the  
advantages of two-sided SSG systems, plus a more streamlined  
appearance.  
Framed skylights are available in two different structural types,  
three glazing types, and two water-management systems. Most  
manufacturers only provide systems in a limited number of the  
possible combinations.  
• Face-sealed systems rely on a perfect watertight seal at the  
exterior face of glazing. Gutters and weeps on the interior side  
of the glazing are provided to control condensation only.  
• Rainscreen systems employ redundant pressure-equalized rain-  
screen technology to control both air and water penetration.  
Gutters and weeps on the interior face drain not only condensa-  
tion but also any minor leaks that get past the exterior seals.  
Although less common, PE rainscreen systems are more reliable.  
• Structural skylights span across the skylight opening and sup-  
port all loads.  
• Skin systems have a frame that performs glazing and water-  
proofing functions. They are applied to a separate structural  
system, typically of wood or steel. Skin systems frequently  
resemble structural systems, except that the members are  
much more shallow.  
• Frameless skylights supported on point glazing mounts are the  
most transparent and expensive skylights. They provide a nearly  
invisible separation between the interior and exterior. The sys-  
tems rely on perfect silicone butt joint glazing. The structural  
support can be one-way or two-way trusses of steel, aluminum,  
wood, laminated glass, tension cables, or combinations of these.  
• Four-sided retained systems have pressure plates or other glaz-  
ing stops on the full perimeter of each pane of glass. Glazing  
should be a wet/dry type or, preferably, a fully wet glazing for  
maximum reliability. Avoid systems \(especially face-sealed sys-  
tems\) that use dry gaskets.

Hatches allow access to roofs for maintenance. Vents allow the  
release of smoke and heat from within the building.  
Awnings and canopies may be factory-fabricated or custom-fabri-  
cated and are designed to provide sun and rain protection for  
windows, entrances, and walkways. They can be illuminated with  
backlighting or graphically embellished and used as signage as  
well.  
Code requirements and design needs may determine the shape,  
size, graphics, materials, and lighting chosen. After lighting is  
installed, the underside of the awning or canopy is finished with a  
“ceiling” \(normally, a prismatic glass, egg crating, or an open-  
weave vinyl-coated polyester or other translucent fabric\) to hide  
the hardware and maximize light reflection.  
Climatic conditions, wind and snow load requirements, and local  
design customs will affect the construction details of the awning or  
canopy framework systems.  
A variety of methods are used to apply graphics to the awning,  
including\: silk screening, handpainting, airbrushing, cut-out letter-  
ing, heat color transferring, pressure-sensitive graphics, and  
eradicating.  
Slip fittings with setscrews or direct tube-to-tube welding are the  
most common frame construction practices. Welded joints are  
more rigid; but shipping, assembly, and disassembly are easier and  
quicker with slip-fitting joints.

# INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
This section discusses common types of partitions, in particular,  
gypsum board assemblies, concrete masonry units, glass unit  
masonry, glazed, and operable partitions, as well as the design of  
fire-resistant partitions.  
Gypsum board is applied over wood or steel framing or furring. The  
quality of the application is largely dependent on the accurate  
alignment of the framing or furring to which the gypsum board is  
attached.  
The choice and installation of framing depends on a number of  
factors. In the case of wood framing, these include the species,  
size, and grade of lumber used. Equally important are the height of  
the wall, the frame spacing, and the maximum span of the surfac-  
ing material.  
Wood framing that meets the following minimum requirements is  
necessary for proper performance of all assemblies.  
1\. The framework should meet the minimum requirements of appli-  
cable building codes.  
2\. Framing members should be straight, true, and of uniform  
dimension. Studs and joists must be in true alignment; bridging,  
firestops, soil pipes, and so on, must not protrude beyond the  
framing.  
3\. All framing lumber should be the correct grade for the intended  
use, and 2 × 4s nominal size or larger should bear the grade  
mark of a recognized inspection agency.  
4\. All framing lumber should have a moisture content not in  
excess of 19 percent at the time of gypsum board application.  
For wood framing installed in the conventional manner, with lumber  
meeting the requirements outlined above, the maximum frame  
spacing is as shown in following figures\:  
Refer to Chapter 3—Building Resiliency for fire-resistance and  
sound-transmission ratings for wood stud, metal stud, and shaft  
wall gypsum board assemblies.  
Framing members and their installation must be selected accord-  
ing to their ability to withstand the loads to which they will be  
subjected. These include live loads \(contributed by the occupancy  
and elements such as wind, snow, and earthquake\) and dead loads  
\(weight of the structure itself\). The minimum lateral load for inte-  
rior partitions is 5 psf for exterior walls, the minimum lateral load  
is 15 to 45 psf or greater, depending on the building height and  
geographic location.

Even though an assembly is structurally capable of withstanding a  
given load, its use may be restricted if the amount of deflection  
that would occur when the lateral load is applied exceeds that  
which the surfacing material can withstand without damage.  
For drywall assemblies, it is desirable to limit deflection to L/240  
\(L = length of the span in inches\) and to never exceed L/120  
\(L/180 in some codes\). The preferred limit for veneer assemblies  
is L/360 and should not exceed L/240.

Wood stud partitions are suitable for residential and light-commer-  
cial construction where combustible framing is permitted by code.  
These designs include single- and double-layer gypsum board fac-  
ings, single- and double-row studs, those with insulating blankets,  
and those with resilient attachments. Performance values up to  
two-hour fire resistance and an STC of 58 can be obtained.

Metal stud partitions are suitable for all types of construction.  
Designs include single- and multilayer gypsum board facings, sin-  
gle- and double-row studs, those with sound attenuation or fire  
blankets, and those with resilient attachments. Performance val-  
ues up to four-hour fire resistance and an STC of 65 can be  
obtained.  
Selection of a stud thickness \(gauge\) and size must take into account  
a number of factors. The key design consideration is whether the  
assembly is for a load-bearing or non-load-bearing or curtain-wall  
application. Other design variables include anticipated wall height,  
weight and dimensions of mounted fixtures, fire rating desired,  
sound attenuation needed, anticipated wind loads, insulation  
requirements, deflection allowance, and desired impact resistance.  
Metal studs were previously specified using gauge to identify the  
thickness of the material. The new standard for specifying steel  
studs, however, is thickness. The most commonly used stud gauges  
for interior partitions are 25 and 20; however, design professionals  
should take care in specifying thickness as not all manufacturers  
provide the same thickness for a given gauge, which could affect  
the design considerations mentioned above.  
It is not unreasonable for the design professional to select the  
stud depth. There are two methods for obtaining the correct thick-  
ness. The design professional can, based on a particular manufac-  
turer’s criteria, evaluate the partition\(s\) in question and specify an  
exact stud depth, thickness, and spacing. Alternatively, the design  
professional can specify the stud depth and use the maximum  
deflection as the criterion for the partition subcontractor to estab-  
lish the required thickness and spacing of the studs.  
In general, stronger or heavier studs are needed to accommodate  
taller walls. Stronger studs also reduce deflection and vibration.  
Fire-rated systems are usually designed, tested, and classified  
based on using the lightest thickness \(gauge\), shallowest stud  
depth, and maximum stud spacing, as indicated in the assembly  
description. Stud thickness and depth may be increased without  
affecting the fire-resistance rating of the assembly.  
Strength and performance characteristics can be achieved in a  
variety of ways. Wall strength can be increased by using heavier  
thickness material, stronger stud designs, narrower stud spacing,  
or larger web dimensions.  
Metal studs are typically manufactured in two different styles\:  
• Studs designed for non-load-bearing interior drywall partition  
applications have a minimum 1-1/4 in. flange width on both  
sides. The web design incorporates a cutout for bracing and for  
electrical, communications, and plumbing lines.  
• Studs designed for load-bearing drywall partition applications  
have a 1-5/8 in. flange width on both sides. Cutouts in the web  
accommodate bracing, utility service, and mechanical attach-  
ments.  
Consult manufacturer’s literature for proper use and installation.

Shaft walls are typically fire-rated partitions that enclose elevator  
shafts, stairwells, and mechanical/electrical/plumbing and other  
vertical building penetrations, making the shafts the lifelines of the  
building. They are critically important for protecting the occupants  
and services from fire.  
The fire-resistance and hourly ratings for shaft wall assemblies  
are established by building codes based on the construction type  
and building use group. Consult authorities having jurisdiction for  
specific code requirements.  
Shaft walls are non-load-bearing gypsum board assemblies con-  
structed from the room/floor side of the shaft \(leaving the shaft  
free of scaffolding\). They are constructed of special gypsum liner  
profile studs, which are set in top and bottom tracks. Metal stud  
profiles are specific to a particular proprietary assembly and  
therefore cannot be used in an untested system. Shaft wall assem-  
blies can be used in both vertical and horizontal applications and  
can provide up to four-hour fire resistance and sound ratings up to  
51 STC.  
Considerations for shaft wall assemblies include limiting-height  
and span support capabilities; allowable deflection limits; and, in  
elevator shafts, intermittent air pressure loads, which may cause  
the walls to flex. The design criteria for determining limiting parti-  
tion height for elevator shaft walls uses deflection, bending stress,  
and end-reaction shear. Designs are available for intermittent lat-  
eral loads up to 15 psf. For sustained pressure in air returns,  
design uniform pressure loads should not exceed 10 psf.  
All openings and devices must not compromise the fire-resistance  
rating. In elevator shafts, this includes hoistway doors, elevator  
call buttons, indicator lights, and other items installed within the  
assembly.  
Consult manufacturer’s literature for proper use and installation.

Single-wythe masonry wall construction is common for many appli-  
cations, both load-bearing and non-load-bearing and interior and  
exterior walls. These single-wythe masonry systems are frequently  
used as interior partitions for fire protection.  
Single-wythe walls may be insulated on the interior or exterior. The  
insulation may be adhered or mechanically fastened directly to the  
masonry, or it may be installed in conjunction with conventional  
furring or studding systems.  
Standard dimensions for concrete masonry units are equal to the  
nominal dimension less the thickness of one mortar joint of 3⁄8 in.  
The nominal 8-in.-high, 16-in.-long concrete masonry unit has an  
actual height of 7-5⁄8 in. and an actual length of 15-5⁄8 in. When  
laid into a wall with a 3⁄8-in. mortar joint, the unit always occupies  
an area 8 by 16 in.  
From the outside corner to the outside corner, a CMU wall has one  
fewer mortar joint than it has blocks. To calculate the actual length  
of the wall, the 3/8-in. width of a mortar joint must be deducted  
from the nominal length of the wall.  
Between an outside corner and an inside corner, a CMU wall has  
the same number of mortar joints and blocks. The length of the wall  
will be an exact multiple of 8 in., and the actual length will be the  
same as the nominal length of the wall.  
From inside corner to inside corner, a CMU wall has one more  
mortar joint than it has blocks, with an actual dimension of 3⁄8 in.  
Concrete masonry unit construction should be dimensioned and  
detailed to minimize cutting and fitting on the site. The module  
established for concrete masonry design is 4 in. vertically and  
horizontally. Maintaining this module reduces waste and provides  
ready coordination with other masonry products, as well as win-  
dow and door openings.

In many applications, single-wythe walls are reinforced. The term  
“partially reinforced” is erroneous; reinforcement schedules are  
designed for a particular application, and all the required rein-  
forcement is necessary. Non-reinforced single-wythe walls are  
used in interior construction where no loads, including lateral  
loads, or other forces are anticipated. Consult with the National  
Concrete Masonry Association and engineers to determine wall  
construction requirements.  
Concrete masonry unit walls are often partially grouted; that is,  
only the cells or cavities of the wall containing reinforcement are  
grouted. When walls are partially grouted, special units or con-  
struction fabric are used for vertical containment of the grout.  
Horizontal containment is usually provided by mortaring the webs  
of the masonry units. When steel placement is frequent, it may  
become economical or necessary to fully grout the walls.  
Structural components of a building using reinforced masonry  
combine the tensile strength of reinforcement with the compres-  
sive strength of the masonry to resist design loads. The benefits of  
incorporating reinforcement are improved ductility, structural  
integrity, and resistance to flexural and shear stresses. Reinforced  
masonry provides economical construction, especially when a high  
degree of resistance to lateral loads is necessary.  
Seismic performance categories A and B require no special provi-  
sions. In many instances, the wind loads will govern the minimum  
reinforcing levels in seismic performance category C and above.  
For designs in seismic performance category C, vertical reinforce-  
ment of at least 0.20 in. in cross-sectional areas must be provided  
continuously from support to support at each corner, at each side  
of each opening, and at the ends of walls. Horizontal reinforcement  
of not less than 0.20 in. must be provided at the bottom and top of  
all openings and extend not less than 24 in. nor less than 40 bar  
diameters past the opening. Horizontal reinforcement should be  
installed continuously at structurally connected roof and floor lev-  
els, at the tops of walls, and at the bottom of the wall or at the top  
of the foundation; maximum spacing is 10 ft., unless uniformly  
distributed joint reinforcement is provided.  
For designs in seismic performance categories D and E, walls must  
be reinforced both vertically and horizontally. Requirements in  
addition to those for seismic performance category C include that  
spacing cannot exceed 4 ft., except for designs using moment-  
resisting space frames, where the spacing of principal reinforce-  
ment must not exceed 2 ft. Also, the diameter of the reinforcement  
cannot be less than 3⁄8 in., except for joint reinforcement. Consult  
with an engineer and the National Concrete Masonry Association  
for information on specific project requirements for reinforcing.  
Glass unit masonry, commonly referred to as glass block, is a  
diverse building material whose many applications exhibit its mul-  
tifaceted characteristics. The varying forms of glass block—type,  
thickness, size, shape, and patterns—along with the methods of  
installation can be combined to create unique design solutions.  
Applications range from entire facades, windows, interior dividers,  
and partitions to skylights, floors, walkways, and stairways. In all  
applications, glass block units permit the control of light, both  
natural and artificial, for function or drama. Glass block also allows  
for control of thermal transmission, noise, dust, and drafts. With  
the use of thick-faced glass block or solid 3-in. bullet-resistant  
block, security can also be achieved.  
An optimum mortar mix for installing glass block units is 1 part  
portland cement, 1⁄2 part lime, and 4 parts sand. Use Type S or  
Type N mortar to suit the application.  
The basic glass block unit is made of two halves fused together  
with a partial vacuum inside. Faces may be clear, figured, or with  
integral relief forms.  
Glass block is available in thicknesses ranging from a minimum of  
3 in. nominal for solid units to a maximum of 4 in. nominal for hol-  
low units. Metric thicknesses range from 76 to 98 mm. Metric sizes  
are available from foreign manufacturers through distributors in  
the United States.  
1\. Glass block panels should not be designed to support structural-  
loads.  
2\. Maximum deflection of structural members supporting glass-  
block panels should not exceed L/600.  
3\. Sills of all panels must be painted with a heavy coat of asphalt  
emulsion and must cure for two hours before the first mortar  
bed is placed.  
4\. Provision for expansion and movement must be made at the  
jambs and heads of all panels. Mortar must not bridge expansion  
spaces.  
5\. Mortar should be mixed and applied in accordance with the  
recommendations of the glass block manufacturer.  
6\. Design and installation of glass block projects should be done by  
whole units; cutting glass block is not recommended.

When specifying supports and shelf angles, the installed weight  
and deflection limitation of the glass block should be considered.  
Local building codes should be consulted for limits on panel sizes  
or installation details. The 2009 International Building Code \(IBC\)  
references TMS 402/ACI 530/ASCE 5 as the standard. Panels with  
an expansion joint stiffener incorporating a concealed vertical  
plate should be limited to a maximum height of 10 ft.  
Some manufacturers provide thick-faced blocks for critical applica-  
tions where a heavier glass block is needed. These blocks have  
superior sound transmission rating and fire-rated properties. Their  
faces are three times as thick as regular glass block units.  
Solid glass block units \(glass bricks\) are impact resistant and allow  
through vision. Surface decoration may be achieved with fused-on

ceramic, etching, or sandblasting. A stipple pattern embossed on  
the exterior face is also available.  
High-performance laminated solid blocks have been developed for  
high ballistic rating and high impact; nominal size is 8 by 8 by 3 in.  
Hurricane-rated products are also available.  
Curved areas should be separated from flat areas by intermediate  
expansion joints and supports. Expansion joints should be installed  
at every change of direction of a multicurved wall, at points of  
curved wall intersection with straight walls, and at the center of  
curvature in excess of 90°.  
When straight, ladder-type reinforcing is used on curved walls, the  
innermost parallel wire may be cut periodically and bent to accom-  
modate the curvature of the wall.  
IBC 714.3.6 covers glazing in corridors. When corridor walls are  
required to have a one-hour fire-resistive rating, any glazing in the  
corridor wall must meet the requirements for interior fire window  
assemblies. The allowable amount of glass depends on which type  
of glass is used—fire-protection-rated glazing or fire-resistance-  
rated glazing\:  
• Fire-protection-rated glazing includes 1/4 in. wire glass set in  
steel frames and approved glass block. When this type of glazing  
is used, the total area of glass cannot exceed 25 percent of the  
area of the common wall separating two spaces or rooms.  
• Fire-resistance-rated glazing includes products such as clear  
ceramics, tempered glass, and insulated glass. These products  
carry various fire ratings of up to two hours and are tested as  
part of a wall assembly. The 25 percent limitation does not apply  
to these types of products, although each manufacturer’s prod-  
uct may have size limitations based on the fire rating of the  
product.  
Both types of glazing must have a label or other identification  
permanently affixed showing the manufacturer’s name, test stan-  
dard, and fire protection rating.  
Requirements for glazing in doors are as follows\:  
• If wire glass is used, size limitations apply, based on the fire  
door rating. Fire-resistance-rated glazing may be used, includ-  
ing ceramic, special-tempered, and insulated glass. These  
products do not have size limitations, except for those devel-  
oped during manufacturer’s testing.  
• For most interior work, a 20-minute-rated door is required when  
used in a one-hour fire-resistance-rated partition used as an  
exit access corridor wall, and a 3/4-hour-rated door is required  
when used in a one-hour partition other than a corridor wall.  
Both doors require gasketing for draft and smoke control.

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
Wood paneling consists of a series of thin sheets of wood panels  
framed together by strips of wood, vertical stiles, and horizontal  
rails. Wood paneling includes shop-fabricated wall paneling that  
may be fabricated as solid lumber paneling, wood veneer paneling,  
and plastic laminate–faced wood paneling. Board paneling fabri-  
cated from standard profile boards is considered finished carpen-  
try, and should not be confused with wood paneling, classified as  
architectural woodwork.  
Wood panels 1 in. thick or less may be solid lumber panels or made  
from veneer over plywood or composition boards. The stiles and  
rails are typically made from solid wood or veneered boards. Rim  
and lip moldings and other trims are made almost exclusively from  
solid wood.  
Mortise and tenon or doweled joints are used to join stile to rail.  
Stile-to-stile joints at outside corners are spline joints or lock  
miters; inside corners are butt jointed. Because of its stability,  
plywood is preferable to solid lumber or other materials as backup.  
Wood veneer wall surfacing that is made-to-order is subject to vari-  
ables within the room, including doors, windows, and cabinets, as  
well as overall room dimensions. The use of balanced-matched pan-  
els rather than center-balanced-matched panels decreases the vari-  
ation in leaf width from panel to panel, maximizing grain continuity.  
Edge-banding options include veneer banding, inset solid wood  
bands, or applied solid wood with corner joints. The bottom edge of  
veneered wall surfacing is edge banded and finished above floor  
level for durability. Reveals and reveal joints can be designed in a  
variety of ways.

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
Wood trim is, generally, a decorative treatment applied after wall,  
floor, and ceiling finishes have been installed. It can be made of flat  
or molded wood, and can consist of single pieces of wood or be  
built up of several pieces that give a more complex and decorative  
appearance. Trims made of MDF with durable plastic finishes are  
also available.  
Interior trim conceals joints between different materials and  
blocks air infiltration through walls, which typically is greatest at  
material joints. Interior trim also frames wall and ceiling openings  
\(door and window/skylight trim\), defines planar edges \(crown and  
base molding\), and acts as a visual divider between dissimilar  
materials \(chair rail\).  
The Architectural Woodwork Institute differentiates wood trim  
according to its length\: Standing trim refers to the trims of fixed  
length delivered to the job site \(i.e., door jambs and casings, win-  
dow stools, etc.\); running trim refers to the trims of random, lon-  
ger length delivered to the job site \(i.e., base, chair rail, crown  
molding, etc.\).  
Guidelines for working with interior wood trim include the following\:  
• Blocking that receives moldings should be set plumb, level, true,  
and straight, with no distortion, and should be provided for full  
surface contact. Attach blocking to substrates with nails,  
screws, or bolts.  
• Woodwork should be stored in a dry, ventilated space. If this is  
not possible, seal the ends of all pieces as soon as possible.  
Moldings should be at optimum moisture content at the time of  
installation and should be allowed to acclimate to project condi-  
tions before installation.  
• Joints in adjacent and related members should be staggered.  
Cope at inside corners, and miter at outside corners, to produce  
tight-fitting joints with full surface contact throughout the length  
of the joint; use scarf joints \(face mitered\) for end-to-end joints  
in trim.  
• Blind-nail where possible and use finishing nails in exposed  
areas. Predrill as required to eliminate splitting; set exposed  
nail heads for filling.  
• Most flat trim like bases and casing have a ploughed or relieved  
back, which gives wide trim a degree of flexibility, allowing it to  
fit snugly against a wall surface.  
Ceramic tile is made from either natural clay or porcelain, and is  
glazed or unglazed.  
• Porcelain tile is a ceramic mosaic or paver tile generally made  
by the dust-pressed method. It is dense, impervious, fine  
grained, and smooth with a sharply formed face.  
• Natural clay tile is a ceramic mosaic or paver tile with a distinc-  
tive, slightly textured appearance. It is made by the dust-  
pressed or plastic method from clays that have a dense body.  
• Glazed tile has an impervious facial finish of ceramic materials  
that is fused to the body of the tile. The body may be nonvitreous,  
semivitreous, vitreous, or impervious.  
• Unglazed tile is a hard, dense tile of uniform composition that  
derives color and texture from the materials used in its fabrication.  
Ceramic wall tiles are modular surfacing units of fired clay and  
other ceramic materials. They provide a permanent, durable,  
waterproof surface for interior walls, and are available in bright or  
matte glazes in a wide range of colors and surface designs. Wall  
tiles are usually 5/16 in. They are available in square, hexagon,  
and octagon shapes, as well as some custom shapes.  
Glazed ceramic wall tiles have a nonvitreous body and bright,  
matte, or crystalline glazes that are impervious to water. Decorative  
thin wall tile is glazed tile with a thin, usually nonvitreous body  
intended for decorative interior residential use. Because it is not  
resistant to breakage, it is not recommended for commercial appli-  
cations or use on floors.  
Cementitious backer boards made of portland cement or treated  
gypsum and lightweight aggregate can be used under thinset tile  
and as a water-resistant base for tile regularly exposed to water  
\(such as a shower surround\).  
Standard sizes for ceramic wall tiles include\:  
• 4-1/4 by 4-1/4 in.  
• 4-1/4 by 6 in.  
• 6 by 6 in.  
Nonvitreous More than 7% Natural clay Ceramic tile is fabricated from clay or a mixture of clay and  
ceramic materials. Natural clay is most commonly used, but porce-  
lain is also available. Porcelain tile is fine grained and smooth. It  
can be formed into sharply detailed designs.  
Tile dimensions are typically nominal. Ceramic tile thickness is  
usually 3/8 or 1/2 in. Refer to the manufacturer’s data for spe-  
cific tile and trim piece dimensions.  
ANSI A137.1, “Specifications for Ceramic Tile,” quantifies the four  
levels of water absorption for tile. The density and porosity of the  
tile determine its capability to absorb moisture. In general, the  
lower the water absorption level, the better the stain resistance of  
the tile.

Ceramic wall tiles come in a variety of trim shapes for finished  
angles and edges. A sanitary base is a coved tile set at the inter-  
section of the floor and wall. Its curved angle helps to prevent dirt  
from accumulating and makes cleaning easier.

• Surface bullnose with a flat bottom and eased top edge  
• Surface cap with a flat bottom and rounded top edge, used  
horizontally or vertically  
• Corner bullnose with two rounded finished edges to complete  
a corner where horizontal and vertical bullnoses meet  
Curb\: Tile curb for horizontal use

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
Granite can be used on interior walls in many finishes, ranging  
from highly polished to a rough thermal finish. A water jet finish is  
a texture between honed and thermal that brings out the color of  
the stone. It will appear slightly darker than a thermal finish.  
Granite is much harder than marble, and is therefore more costly  
to fabricate and finish.  
appropriate for the intended use. Stone facing typically does not  
need to meet the rigorous performance criteria of stone flooring,  
but care should be taken to select a stone that can be cut and  
dressed to meet the project’s design. A review with the stone  
fabricator or supplier is recommended to minimize the risk of  
incompatibility of the stone with the intended use.  
Stone facing is available in two basic types\: dimension stone pan-  
els and dimension stone tiles. Marbles and other stones that might  
be considered too soft for flooring can usually be used for stone  
facing, with the proper reinforcement and installation.  
Marble varieties that are not recommended for exterior use can be  
successfully used in interior wall panel applications, if properly  
prepared for vertical installations. Heavily veined marbles, prized  
for their aesthetic qualities, are examples. Dry seams can be glued  
together \(sticking\), voids can be filled \(waxing\), and weak areas  
can be reinforced with metal rods glued into the back of the stone  
panel \(rodding\). During fabrication, fragile marbles are frequently  
reinforced with a layer of fiberglass-reinforced plastic prior to final  
fabrication and polishing of the marble.  
Dimension stone is defined as quarried stone with usually one or  
more mechanically dressed surfaces. These are thick slabs of  
stone that are marked as they are cut for matched-pattern instal-  
lations, such as book-matched or end-matched configurations.  
Dimension stone facing panel dimensions typically range from  
larger-dimension units with face areas up to 48 sq. in. and 3⁄4 in.  
or more thick. Sizes and shapes are limited to the specific stone’s  
characteristics. A panel that is 2 ft-6 in. by 5 ft-0 in. is a size that  
stone fabricators can easily handle, and it conforms to the 5-ft  
module of many buildings.  
Green varieties of marble, called serpentine marble, are sensitive  
to water and are prone to warping when wet. When installing ser-  
pentine stone, use setting materials that do not contain water, such  
as water-cleanable epoxy adhesives.  
Greenstone, a general term for metamorphosed igneous basaltic  
type rock, is typically available in honed or cleft finishes, and is not  
suitable for a highly polished finish, due to the stone structure.  
Greenstone contains minerals that give it a green appearance\:  
actinolite, chlorite, or epidote. Sources are usually European, as it  
is no longer quarried in the United States.  
Stone tiles are fabricated under different conditions from dimen-  
sion stone panels and are not typically matched to create patterns,  
such as book matching or end matching. The greater variation in  
stone color, pattern, and texture is common in stone tile, and  
should be factored into the project review prior to installation.  
Stone tile modules are dimension stone units that do not exceed 4  
sq. ft. and are less than 3⁄4 in. thick. Stone tiles are typically 12 by  
12 in. up to 24 by 24 in., and 1⁄4, 3⁄8, or 1⁄2 in. thick. They are  
usually furnished with a protective backing such as fiberglass to  
improve their strength. Larger stone tile sizes are offered by  
selected manufacturers.  
Granite and marble stone tiles 1/4 to 1/2 in. thick are available,  
usually with a face dimension of 12 by 12 in. Tiles can be directly  
applied to a wall with adhesive or thinset mortar, similar to flooring  
applications. Tiles are not recommended for walls over 8 ft. high.  
Dolomitic limestone is more widely used for interior stone facing,  
as it is typically not as porous as oolitic limestone \(which contains  
small spheres of calcium carbonate formed around sand grains or  
shell fragments\), and is often polished similar to marble. It is also  
available with a smooth honed finish, a textured sandblasted finish,  
or a split-face finish.  
Slate is commonly used as a contemporary interior floor or wall  
finish. It is available in a palette of dark, rich colors, including  
green, black, purple, and red. Slate splits easily into thin sheets.  
The finish resulting from the natural face is referred to as a cleft  
finish. Slate can also be sand-rubbed to a smooth or honed finish.  
Travertine is distinguished by its natural cavities, formed by plants  
embedded during the rock’s formation, which must be filled to  
achieve a smooth surface. Filling materials are typically portland  
cement, epoxy resins, or polyester resins. Travertine is actually a  
kind of limestone, but some types that take a polish are classified  
as marble. It is popular for use as flooring because its visual tex-  
ture conceals dirt much better than most other stones.  
Stone with distinctive texture and markings, such as certain mar-  
bles, lends itself to specific pattern arrangements. The markings  
vary depending on whether the marble veneer is cut with or across  
its setting bed. Dimension stone panels are available in the follow-  
ing patterns\:  
• Blend pattern\: Panels of the same variety of stone but not nec-  
essarily from the same block are arranged at random.  
• Side-slip pattern\: Panels from the same block are placed side by  
side or end to end in sequence, to ensure a repetitive pattern  
and blended color.  
• End-matched pattern\: Adjacent panel faces are finished, and one  
panel is inverted and placed above the other.  
• Book-matched pattern\: Adjacent panel faces are finished, and  
one panel is placed next to the other.

Numerous types of stones can be used for stone facing; however,  
consideration should be given to the selection of a stone that is

Marble quarry blocks are reduced to slabs by a gang saw consist-  
ing of a series of parallel steel blades that move forward and  
backward in a frame. The most productive and precise gang saws  
use diamond-tipped blades with individual hydraulic blade tension-  
ers; others are fed a cutting abrasive in a stream of water.  
Marble blocks can be sawn either parallel or perpendicular to the  
bedding plane. The perpendicular cut is referred to as an across-  
the-bed, or vein, cut. The parallel cut is a with-the-bed, or Fleuri,  
cut. Other marbles produce a pleasing surface only when sawn in  
one direction, and are generally available only in that variety.

Only certain marbles lend themselves to specific pattern arrange-  
ments, such as side slip or end slip, which require a constant natu-  
ral marking trend throughout the marble block. Formal patterns  
require selectivity, which usually increases the installed cost of the  
marble veneer. Usually, material sawn for a vein cut can be  
matched. Fleuri cuts can only be blended.  
Perfection in veneer matching is impossible because a portion of  
the marble block is lost during the sawing process, and because  
the vein shifts. Ideally, jointing should be planned for groupings of  
four panels of equal size.

range in the pastel hues.  
New technology has enabled the development of engineered com-  
posite stone products. Formulated from stone aggregate and syn-  
thetic resin matrix materials, these products are available in sizes  
ranging from tile units to large panel sheets for horizontal and  
vertical applications. Composite stone characteristics are strength,  
nonporosity, durability, and flexibility. Finishes are typically limited  
to polished finishes; colors range from natural stone tones to  
vibrant colors. Thicknesses vary, and due to the strength of the  
composite units, can sometimes be thinner than natural dimension  
stone. Typical sheet sizes are 3/4 or 1-1/8 in.; 3/8-in.-thick sheet  
panels may also be available. Tile units are installed with the same  
thinset methods as for ceramic tile.  
Abrasion resistance is the capability of the stone to resist wear  
and absorption, which affects staining and soiling of the stone. For  
interior stone facing, abrasion resistance is typically not a factor,  
unless the stone will be subjected to frequent bumping and scrap-  
ing. Consult with the stone fabricator or supplier for the selection  
of appropriate stone types for a particular installation and intend-  
ed use.  
Wire-tie anchoring systems with plaster or mortar spots are the  
traditional methods for installing interior stone facing. Mechanical  
anchoring systems fasten stone directly to the backup wall, elimi-  
nating the need for additional studding and gypsum board and  
providing verifiable seismic restraint.

Wire ties are anchored to the gypsum board, masonry, or concrete  
wall. In gypsum board construction, wire ties are embedded in  
plaster-filled metal boxes or are inserted through the gypsum  
board and are fastened to the partition framing. In masonry walls,  
the wire ties are embedded in voids filled with mortar or plaster.  
The disadvantages of wire-tie anchoring systems are twofold\:  
First, fire-rated gypsum board walls require another row of metal  
studs and another layer of gypsum board if the wire ties are not  
allowed to penetrate the fire-rated wall; second, seismic restraint  
for the stone panels is difficult to engineer.  
A minimum of four anchors should be provided for stone panels up  
to 12 sq. ft., with two additional anchors for each additional 8 sq.  
ft. of surface area. For stone facing panels over 96 in. high, the  
wire-tie method must be supplemented with intermediate horizon-  
tal supports for the vertical stone loads.  
In mechanical anchoring systems, the stone is kerfed \(grooved or  
notched\) on the back side and is restrained by the use of straps or  
clips. Anchor systems similar to those used for exterior work over  
masonry or metal framing may be fastened to metal studs through  
gypsum board. Exterior anchors may also be used with metal channel  
struts, eliminating the need to coordinate stud locations with anchor  
locations. This type of anchor may still require plaster-setting spots.

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
Grout for interior stone facing is commonly mixed with latex addi-  
tives, which produces a more flexible and durable joint installation.  
The stone industry references ANSI standards for ceramic tile–  
grouting materials. Dryset grouts are mixtures of portland cement  
and water-retentive additives. Unsanded grouts are typically used  
in joints up to 1⁄8 in. wide. Wider grout joints are typically sanded,  
as the sand reduces grout shrinkage and minimizes cracking. When  
installing sanded grout on polished stone surfaces, protect the  
stone face to avoid scratching the surface finish.  
Joint sizes vary depending on the type of stone and finish selected  
and whether joints are to be coordinated with exterior or floor  
joints. For polished stone installations, joints from 1⁄16 to 1/8 in.  
wide are used. Currently, the wider joint size is prevalent to allow  
for more latitude in fabrication dimensions and in backup construc-  
tion dimensions. For highly textured stone finishes, such as a  
thermal or cleft finish, a joint width of 1⁄4 to 3⁄8 in. is common.  
The larger joint dimension minimizes the visibility of lipping of  
stone panels. When combining different stone textures, one size  
joint for the entire installation is recommended, usually the largest  
required for the different textures.  
board assemblies provide fire resistance and sound transmission  
reduction of varying degrees. Gypsum board may be finished with  
paint or other applied finish materials, such as a wallcovering,  
wood, or tile.  
Design professionals should make sure that their specifications  
use the correct designation, ASTM C 1396, “Standard Specification  
for Gypsum Board,” so that they are in compliance with both  
industry standards and code language. This standard consolidates  
and replaces ASTM standards C 36, C 79, C 442, C 630, C 931, and  
C 960.  
Mold and moisture dynamics have grown as increasingly important  
design and specification concerns with materials that have absorp-  
tive characteristics and are prone to mold and mildew problems.  
Gypsum board must be properly installed, finished, and provided  
with adequately designed and operated climate control systems to  
avoid these problems.  
The North American gypsum industry has developed a responsi-  
ble and environmentally conscious attitude toward issues of  
reclamation, preservation of natural resources, recycling and  
waste management, and otherwise protecting the environment.  
Over 90 percent of the gypsum board paper used comes from  
recycled materials. The industry increasingly uses synthetic gyp-  
sum to manufacture gypsum board. This raw material is a by-  
product, or waste, from other manufacturing processes as well  
as the desulfurization of flue gases in fossil fuel power plants.  
Lippage is the condition where one panel is higher than adjacent  
panels; it is more common in thinset installations. The recom-  
mended maximum variation of the finished stone surface should be  
no greater than 1⁄8 in. cumulative over a 10 ft. lineal measure-  
ment, with no greater than a 1⁄32-in. variation between individual  
tiles or panels. Each interior stone facing project should be  
reviewed to determine the best method of installation for the  
installation conditions. Setting space dimensions and project condi-  
tions may indicate the use of a particular installation method.  
Stone tile may be installed in a full mortar bed, in a thinset mortar  
bed, or with an adhesive. Thin stone tiles are typically not  
restrained by ties or anchors; therefore, their installation has  
limitations.  
Tiles that are installed above 8 ft. high must be additionally  
restrained with anchors. Interior stone anchoring systems must be  
compatible with the stone and substrate. Stone facing may be  
installed on gypsum board construction, masonry, or concrete  
walls. Butt joints are not recommended due to potential spalling  
\(surface chipping or scaling\) if movement occurs in the structure.  
Mortar beds can be used when installing thin stone tiles and thin  
panels in a thick portland cement mortar system consisting of  
metal lath, a scratch coat, and a float coat. The stone tile is set into  
the float coat.  
Thinset installations are appropriate for vertical application of  
stone tiles and thin panels up to 1⁄2 in. thick. The stone is set in the  
same manner as ceramic tiles, directly on the substrate of gypsum  
board or cementitious backer units, using specific thin-bed setting  
systems. Adhesives used with thinset installations should be non-  
staining, especially when installing light-colored stone.

Gypsum board \(also called sheet rock or gyp board\) is the generic  
name for a family of sheet products consisting of a noncombusti-  
ble gypsum core faced with a paper surface. Certain gypsum  
A number of specialized gypsum panel products and gypsum

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
• Glass fiber tape for veneer plaster finishes comes with a pres-  
sure-sensitive adhesive backing or plain back for fastening with  
staples. Typically used when one-day joint finishing is required.  
Joint tape is for use with joint compounds in the reinforcement and  
concealment of flat joints and inside corners. It is approximately 2  
to 2-1/2 in. wide and comes in various roll lengths ranging from 75  
to 500 ft. Consult manufacturer’s literature for proper use and  
installation.  
There are generally two types of products\:  
• Paper tape for treatment with joint compounds is designed for  
both embedding by hand and application with a mechanical tap-  
ing tool; joint is covered with a thin layer of compound before  
taping.  
Gypsum board panels are finished using reinforcing tapes and  
gypsum board taping, topping, or all-purpose compounds. Products  
are available in site-mixed or ready-mixed formulations.  
Taping compounds are designed for embedding tape. They have  
excellent bond and crack resistance but are harder to sand and  
finish than topping or all-purpose compounds.  
All-purpose joint compounds are good for taping, topping, and  
repairing cracks. They perform with versatility for use as tape,  
finish, texture, laminate, or skim coat applications.  
Topping compounds, which have low shrinkage and are easy to  
apply and sand, are most suitable for second- and third-coat  
applications.  
• Level 0\: Temporary construction or where final finish has not  
been determined.  
• Level 1\: Frequently specified in plenum areas above ceilings, in  
attics, where assembly is concealed, or in building service cor-  
ridors and other areas not normally open to public view. Some  
degree of sound and smoke control is provided; sometimes  
referred to as fire taping. Where a fire-resistance rating is  
required for gypsum board assembly, details of construction  
should be in accordance with reports of fire tests of assemblies  
that have met the fire-rating requirement.  
• Level 2\: Specified where water-resistant gypsum backing board  
\(ASTM C 1396\) is used as a substrate for tile. May also be  
specified in garages, warehouse storage, or other similar areas  
where surface appearance is not of primary concern.  
• Level 3\: Typically specified in appearance areas that are to  
receive heavy- or medium-texture sprayed or hand-applied fin-  
ishes before final painting or where heavy-grade wallcoverings  
are to be applied. Not recommended where smooth painted  
surfaces or light- to medium-weight wallcoverings are specified.  
• Level 4\: Specified where flat paints, light textures, or wallcover-  
ings are to be applied. In critical lighting areas, flat paints  
applied over light textures tend to reduce joint photographing.  
Gloss, semi-gloss, and enamel paints are not recommended  
over this level of finish. Carefully evaluate weight, texture, and  
sheen level of wallcoverings. Joints and fasteners must be  
adequately covered with wallcovering material that is light-  
weight, and which has limited pattern or a gloss finish.  
Unbacked vinyl wallcoverings are not recommended.  
• Level 5\: Highly recommended where gloss, semigloss, enamel,  
or nontextured flat paints are specified or where severe lighting  
conditions occur. This highest-quality finish is the most effective  
method to provide a uniform surface and minimize the possibil-  
ity of joint photographing and of fasteners showing through the  
final decoration.

For centuries, prior to the advent of gypsum board, plaster was the  
primary interior wall and ceiling finish. Conventional plaster pro-  
vides superior wear resistance to gypsum board assemblies, and  
is preferred to attain a uniform, monolithic surface; however,  
plaster finishes are more labor-intensive, require greater skill, and  
can take as long as two days to cure, compared to gypsum board  
assemblies. For these reasons, plaster finishes are most com-  
monly used in restoration to match existing conditions and in high-  
end installations.  
Three-coat plaster applications are required on all metal lath and  
on edge-supported gypsum lath used in ceilings. In addition, three-  
coat applications are preferred, although two-coat applications are  
acceptable where gypsum lath is properly supported, and on  
masonry plaster bases such as porous brick, clay tiles, and rough  
concrete masonry units.  
Keene’s cement plaster is a specialty finish coat of gypsum plaster  
primarily used where a smooth, dense, vandal-resistant, white  
finish is desired.  
Thickness, proportion of mixes of various plastering materials, and  
finishes vary. Methods of application also vary widely, depending  
on local traditions and innovations promoted by the industry.

When working with plaster, it is important to know these terms\:  
• Basecoat\: A plaster coat applied before finish coat, scratch coat,  
and blow coats in three-coat plaster.  
• Brown coat\: In three-coat plaster, the second coat; in two-coat  
plaster, the first coat.  
• Fibered plaster\: Gypsum plaster containing fibers of hair, glass,  
nylon, or sisal.  
• Finish coat\: The final coat of plaster, which provides the decora-  
tive surface.  
• Furring\: Generally, channels or Z-shapes attached to the under-  
lying wall \(or structure for ceilings\) for attaching gypsum or  
metal lath while allowing an airspace. Often used on cementi-  
tious substrate, resilient furring is used to reduce sound trans-  
mission.  
• Gypsum\: Hydrous calcium sulfate, a natural mineral in crystal-  
line form.  
• Gypsum lath\: A base for plaster; a sheet having a gypsum core,  
faced with paper. Also perforated for interior use.  
• Hydrated lime\: Quicklime mixed with water, at the site, to form  
a lime putty.  
• Lime\: Obtained by burning various types of limestone, consisting  
of oxides or hydroxides of calcium and magnesium.  
• Lime plaster\: Basecoat plaster of hydrated lime and an aggre-  
gate.  
• Neat plaster\: Basecoat plaster, fibered or unfibered, used for  
site-mixing with aggregates.  
• Perlite\: Siliceous volcanic glass containing silica and alumina,  
expanded by heat for use as a lightweight plaster aggregate.  
• Plaster\: Cementitious material or combination of cementitious  
materials and aggregate, which when mixed with water forms a  
plastic mass that sets and hardens when applied to a surface.  
• Portland cement\: Manufactured combination of limestone and  
an argillaceous substance for exterior or wet-atmosphere  
applications.  
• Scratch coat\: In three-coat plastering, the first coat, which is  
then scratched to provide a bond for the second, or brown, coat.  
• Stucco portland cement\: Plaster used in exterior application.  
This plaster requires a waterset and must not be applied to a  
smooth dense surface or gypsum lath; it requires control joints,  
and cannot have a Keene’s cement-lime putty finish.  
• Three-coat plaster\: Preferred application for all substrates;  
required over metal lath.  
• Two-coat plaster\: Acceptable on lath and on the interior face of  
rough concrete block, clay tile, or porous brick.  
• Vermiculite\: Micaceous mineral of silica, magnesium, and  
alumina oxides made up in a series of parallel plates, or lami-  
nae, and expanded by heat for use as a lightweight plaster  
aggregate.

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
Textiles must be back-coated to be installed as wall covering. The  
backing provides a barrier to prevent adhesives from bleeding  
through and ruining the finish face of the fabric. Backings also  
provide the dimensional stability required for a textile to withstand  
the stretching and smoothing operations of wall covering installa-  
tion. Two types of back-coating treatments are paper backing and  
acrylic latex backing\:  
• Paper backing involves laminating paper to the reverse side of  
the textile, which stiffens the textile for easier installation. The  
textile assumes properties similar to those of wallpaper.  
• Acrylic latex coating involves stretching the textile in a frame  
and applying a latex compound. The textile retains some of its  
inherent flexibility but is much less dimensionally stable than  
paper-backed textiles and may increase installation costs. Latex  
backings do, however, improve ravel resistance and seam slip-  
page. Often, due to its lack of rigidity, the adhesive used with this  
wall covering must be applied to the wall, rather than to the  
back of the wall covering. Consequently, this process is more  
labor-intensive and requires a higher degree of skill.  
Fiberglass wall covering is composed of fiberglass yarns adhered  
together. Fiberglass wall covering is inherently flame-resistant  
and is suitable for use in reinforcing fragile or deteriorating wall  
surfaces. It is permeable, making it intrinsically mold- and mildew-  
resistant. Fiberglass wall coverings must be painted after instal-  
lation; and, typically, a latex paint is selected to maintain the  
breathability of the wall. This wall covering type provides a tex-  
tured pattern only, not a color.  
Wall coverings offer improved durability over paint finishes while  
providing texture and pattern to the wall surface. Wall covering  
types include vinyl, textile, wallpapers, fiberglass, and wood  
veneer. The most popular wall covering for commercial use is vinyl,  
favored for its affordability and durability.  
Wood veneer wall covering is made by bonding veneer slices, about  
1⁄64-in. thick, to a woven backing material. The resulting wall  
covering is thin enough to be pliable along the grain lines but too  
thick to be flexible in the horizontal direction \(perpendicular to the  
wood grain\). The inherent flexibility of wood veneer wall covering  
makes installation easy around columns and other curved surfaces.  
The thinness of wood veneer wall covering does, however, raise  
three major concerns\:  
• Finishing operations after installation  
• Proper substrate preparation  
• Moisture  
Moreover, wood veneer wall covering is too thin to be sanded.  
Therefore, care must be taken during installation to prevent the  
surface from being stained or damaged. Also, wall surface imper-  
fections tend to telegraph through the thin veneer, so in areas  
where the substrate cannot be prepared to a smooth, level sur-  
face, veneered plywood panels are a better choice. Buckling and  
warpage caused by moisture can be additional significant prob-  
lems for this kind of wall covering; therefore, it is not recom-  
mended for application to the interior surface of an exterior wall,  
unless the finish face of the wall is furred out and dampproofed.  
Wood veneer wall coverings are available prefinished or unfin-  
ished. Unfinished veneers must be stained and finished after they  
are installed. Some finishes, for example, penetrating oils, can  
have an adverse effect on the wall covering adhesive. Coatings  
applied to the surface of installed wood veneer should be approved  
by the wall covering manufacturer.  
The installation of wood veneer wall covering is similar to the  
installation of other types of wall covering; however, the sheets  
must be butted together and cannot be overlapped and trimmed.

The two vinyl wall covering manufacturing processes are calender-  
ing and plastisol methods\:  
• Calendering squeezes liquid vinyl over a series of hot metal roll-  
ers, flattening the compound into a sheet. The vinyl is then  
laminated under heat and pressure to a backing material.  
• Calendered vinyl wall covering is harder, tougher, and usually much  
thicker than wall covering manufactured by the plastisol method.  
• The plastisol method spreads liquid vinyl onto a backing  
material, which is then fused together under high temperatures.  
Plastisol technology is used primarily for residential wall  
coverings.  
There are four traditional ways to prepare a wall surface for a wall  
covering\: prime, seal, size, or apply a wall liner.  
• Primers ensure proper adhesion and are the most commonly  
required wall preparation for commercial installations.  
• Sealers are usually oil-based, made either of an alkyd or shellac.  
They provide stain-sealing properties; for example, walls that  
have suffered water damage must typically be sealed before  
they can be finished with either paint or wall covering. Sealers  
also promote strippability without damage to the wall surface.  
Not all textiles are suitable for use as wall coverings, nor are tex-  
tile wall coverings appropriate in applications where wear resis-  
tance is a concern.

ing the penetration of the paste. However, sizing does not neces-  
sarily improve the bond between the adhesive and the wall  
surface.

• Wall liners are nonwoven sheets; their installation is similar to  
that of wall covering. They are sometimes required where wall  
surfaces cannot be prepared by conventional means. Wall liners  
can be used to prevent cracks, holes, and gaps from telegraph-  
ing through the wall covering. They may also be used in lieu of  
primers/sealers to mask contrasting colors or areas of light and  
dark on the substrate.

carts may bump into the walls.  
A variety of primers, paints, coatings, and stains are available,  
some of which are described here. Note in Figure 12.146 that  
paints and stains can be categorized as either water- or oil-based.

Primers make a surface more paintable by providing improved  
adhesion for coatings. They are selected in relation to the charac-  
teristics of the selected topcoat, and serve the following functions\:  
• Conceal the substrate surface so that the existing coating color  
does not “read” through.  
• Provide a barrier to prevent moisture from destroying the paint  
bond.  
• Bind the substrate surface with the topcoat.  
• Limit the paint absorption of a porous substrate, such as a skim  
coat of plaster.  
• Recondition old paint to receive future paint coatings.  
• Act as a rust inhibitor.  
The solvent-thinned resin in alkyd paint is made from synthetic oils.  
Alkyd resins are oil-modified polyesters made primarily from alco-  
hol and acid. They are the most common paint resin. Alkyd paints  
are faster drying, harder, and more durable, and have better color  
retention properties than oil-based paints. They are easy to apply,  
are washable, and have fewer odors than other paints using sol-  
vent thinners. However, alkyd paints have poor resistance to alka-  
line surfaces, such as masonry, and should not be used unless  
these substrates are properly primed.  
Most water-based paints are referred to as latex paint. Latex  
paints have very little odor and a fast drying time. Their water-base  
thinner makes them easy to apply, clean up, and discard. Latex  
paints are porous, meaning that when applied a latex coating  
retains microscopic openings that allow it to breathe. Adhesion  
failure is prevented because moisture that might become trapped  
beneath the paint’s surface can evaporate through these openings.  
The disadvantage of latex paints is that they have a greater blister-  
ing tendency when high levels of tinting color are present.

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
The solvent-thinned resin in oil-based paint is made from natural  
oils, such as linseed oil \(from flax seed\), soya oil \(from soybeans\),  
and tung oil \(from china wood tree fruit\).  
Catalyzed epoxy coatings resist chemicals, solvents, stains,  
physical abrasion, traffic, and cleaning materials. They have good  
adhesion and color retention. Catalyzed epoxies come in two  
parts\: resin and catalyst. They have a limited “pot life,” hence are  
required to be mixed just prior to use. When applied to a sub-  
strate, a chemical action occurs that causes a dense hard film to  
form, similar to baked enamel. Adequate ventilation must be  
provided during and after application.  
Three types of catalyzed epoxies are commonly used in commercial  
interiors\:  
• Polyester epoxies, which produce a tough glossy surface  
• Polyamide epoxies, which provide a flexible but durable film  
• Urethane epoxies, which are the most versatile of the epoxy  
coatings  
Epoxy esters are similar to catalyzed epoxy, but have no pot-life  
restrictions and are packaged like conventional paint. The paint film  
occurs due to oxidation, rather than a chemical reaction triggered  
by a catalyst. Epoxy esters are less durable than catalyzed epoxies.  
cooling process. Most glasses soften at 932° to 2012°F. Minute  
surface scratches in manufacturing greatly reduce glass strength.  
Glass is considered a liquid, even though it is rigid and behaves like  
a solid. As is characteristic of a liquid, the atoms in a sheet of glass  
are randomly arranged. They are frozen in place by rapid cooling  
during manufacturing. In most other mineral solids, the atoms are  
arranged in a recognizable geometric pattern and have a crystal-  
line structure.  
Generally accepted as the successor to polished plate glass, float  
glass has become the quality standard of the glass industry. More  
than 95 percent of the glass manufactured in the United States is  
float glass. It is manufactured by floating molten glass on a surface  
of molten tin. Because the molten metal is denser than the glass,  
the two liquids do not mix together. This process produces a glass  
with very uniform thickness and flatness. After forming, the glass  
is cooled by a controlled process known as annealing.  
Annealing relieves internal strains that may have developed during  
the manufacturing process. It ensures that the glass does not cool  
and contract at different rates across its surface. If glass is not  
annealed, it may fracture from differential stresses throughout the  
sheet when it reaches room temperature.  
The requirements for float glass are defined in ASTM C 1036,  
“Standard Specification for Flat Glass.” Float glass is available in  
thicknesses ranging from 1/8 to 7/8 in.  
are produced. Heat-strengthened glass is about twice as resistant  
to breakage as float glass.  
Laminated glass consists of two or more layers of glass and an  
interlayer material sandwiched together to form a single sheet.  
There are two types of interlayers\: polyvinyl butyral \(PVB\) sheets,  
which are bonded under heat and pressure; and urethane acrylate  
resin, a liquid that is cured under ultraviolet light. PVB interlayers  
can be colored or patterned and can be combined for a decorative  
effect. The interlayer blocks a portion of ultraviolet rays, and is a  
sound barrier that dampens vibrations between the two pieces of  
glass. Rice paper and other ornamental sheets can also be used in  
the lamination process. Cast resin interlayers are clear or custom  
colored and allow more heavily textured glass to be laminated.  
Annealed, fully tempered, heat-strengthened, and wire glass types  
can be laminated. Security glass \(bullet or burglar resistant\) and  
acoustic glass are types of laminated glass using thicker interlay-  
ers. If laminated glass is broken, the glass remains bonded to the  
interlayer, offering protection from injury; this makes it popular for  
use in skylights. Laminated glass with an interlayer of 0.030-in.  
minimum thickness meets the Federal Safety Glazing requirements  
of ANSI Z97.1, “Safety Glazing Materials Used in Buildings—  
Safety Performance Specifications and Methods of Test,” and  
Consumer Product Safety Commission \(CPSC\) 16 CFR 1201,  
“Safety Standard for Architectural Glazing Materials, Category II,”  
similar to tempered glass. Laminated glass with an interlayer thick-  
ness of 0.015 in. meets the requirements of Category I glass. The  
standard for laminated glass is ASTM C 1172, “Standard  
Specification for Laminated Architectural Flat Glass.”  
Intumescent paints slow the rate at which fire spreads by delaying  
the ignition of the surface that has been coated. They are used on  
combustible materials such as wood to achieve the required  
flamespread ratings. These paints delay but do not prevent a fire  
from spreading. Fire-retardant paints are intumescent and protect  
the substrate from burning by swelling to form a charred layer of  
blisters when exposed to extremely high heat.  
Intumescent paint is a foam-like material made with either a  
water-based or solvent-based thinner. Requisite fire ratings are  
achieved with this material based on the number of coatings  
applied to the substrate at a prescribed thickness. Intumescent  
paint manufacturers certify painters to ensure that their products  
are correctly applied.  
There are several types of glass with increased strength\: fully  
tempered, heat strengthened, laminated, and wire glass.  
Fire-retardant paints resist the spread of fire by not contributing to  
the flame. They are, however, less effective at controlling the  
spread of fire than intumescent coatings.  
Fully tempered glass is produced by heating float glass and then  
suddenly cooling it with special blowers. The outer surface cools  
quickly and contracts, constraining the hot inner core as it contin-  
ues to cool. The surface and edges of fully tempered glass are in  
compression, while the inner core is in tension. Fully tempered  
glass is three to five times more resistant to impact, applied pres-  
sure, and bending stresses than annealed glass, because the sur-  
face tension must be overcome before the glass can be broken. The  
tempering process is defined by ASTM C 1048, “Standard  
Specification for Heat-Treated Flat Glass—Kind HS, Kind FT,  
Coated, and Uncoated Glass.”  
Cutting or drilling fully tempered glass will destroy the integrity of  
the skin’s compressive strength and will likely cause breakage;  
therefore, fully tempered glass cannot be field cut. Fully tempered  
glass must be fabricated with the required holes or cutouts. It is  
available in thicknesses ranging from 1/8 to 1 in.  
Wire glass has wire mesh or parallel wires rolled into the center of  
the glass sheet. It is available in various patterns and pattern sizes  
such as square-welded mesh, diamond-welded mesh, and linear  
parallel wire. Pattern sizes range from 1/2 to 1 in., depending on  
pattern type. Some distortion, wire discoloration, and misalign-  
ment are inherent. If breakage occurs, the wire helps to hold the  
glass fragments in the opening, thus preventing personal injuries.  
This is the standard glass type used for fire-rated doors or parti-  
tion assemblies.  
Multicolor coatings are durable and scratch-resistant. They add a  
three-dimensional quality to a surface, similar to hand-sponge tech-  
niques. Multicolor coatings can be water-thinned or solvent-thinned.  
Traditional solvent-thinned multicolor coatings are composed of tiny  
bubbles of different sizes and colors suspended in a nonpigmented  
solution. The separated beads of pigment remain separate until they  
are spray-applied. They burst upon impact with the surface.  
The heat-strengthened glass manufacturing process is similar to  
that of fully tempered glass, except that the glass is only partially  
tempered. Annealed glass is heated and cooled in a manner similar  
to that for fully tempered glass; however, lower surface stresses  
Safety glass is glazing material that breaks in a way that reduces  
the likelihood of cutting and piercing injuries if shattered. Fully  
tempered glass and laminated glass qualify as safety glass. Fully  
tempered glass breaks into small cubical pieces. If laminated glass  
is shattered, the broken glass adheres to the interlayer.  
The requirements for safety glass are defined by two very similar  
standards\: CPSC 16 CFR 1201 and ANSI Z97.1. These standards  
use the same test procedures, with the exception that the CPSC  
standard uses a greater impact load. Although wired glass does  
not pass the tests for safety glass described in CPSC 16 CFR 1201,  
it is granted an exemption because it is the only glass type that  
performs successfully in fire tests.

Stains made from dyes dissolved in either drying oil or water pro-  
vide translucent or transparent coatings for wood. Oil-based stains  
use drying oil made from various plants. The oil dries by absorbing  
oxygen from the surface, and the air creates a tough elastic film  
that protects wood. Wood surfaces can be filled before staining in  
order to affect surface porousness and smoothness, but fillers may  
cause stains to be absorbed unevenly. Stain may be applied with a  
brush, spray, roller, or rag pad.

Security glass is composed of multiple layers of glass and/or  
polycarbonate plastic laminated together under heat and pressure  
with a polyvinyl butyral \(for glass\) or polyurethane plastic \(for  
polycarbonate\) film. It is available in multilayer laminated glass,  
insulating, laminated insulating, and double-laminated insulating or  
spaced configurations. Thicknesses range from 3/8 to 2-1/2 in. as  
a laminated product and up to about 4-3/4 in. for insulating and  
spaced construction products.  
Bullet-resistant glass should meet the requirements of UL 752,  
“Standard for Bullet-Resisting Equipment,” and burglar-resistant  
glass should meet the requirements of UL 972, “Standard for  
Burglary-Resisting Glazing Material.” Consult manufacturers for  
blast-resistant glass. Security glass products, depending on type,  
are subject to size limitations; consult with the manufacturer for  
glazing requirements and restrictions on use.  
Bracing bars are fastened to the sash at frequent intervals to  
strengthen and support the leaded glass. Round bars tied to the  
leaded glass with twisted copper wires are the most flexible and  
resilient, allowing for great amounts of thermal movement. Where  
this system is not suitable, galvanized steel flat bars can be sol-  
dered to the surface of the leaded glass.  
When the glass requires detail painting, shading, or texturing, it  
must be done with special mineral pigments and fired at tempera-  
tures of 1000° to 1200°F or higher to ensure absolute permanency.  
Decorative glass panels should not exceed 12 sq. ft., making it  
necessary to divide larger openings with metal division bars. Tee  
bars are used for single glazed windows, and special channel bars  
are used for windows with outside protection glass.  
Machine-made and blown glass from the United States, England,  
France, and Germany is available in most solid colors, as well as  
mixed colors and textures. Uniformity of color will vary from glass of  
different batches. Special colors are derived by sumping, or kiln firing.  
Low-iron glass, or ultraclear glass, has high clarity and high visible  
light transmittance, without the marked greenish tint visible on the  
edge of standard glass. The clarity in the glass is achieved by  
reducing the iron content by approximately 10 percent. Thicknesses  
range from 1/8 to 3/4 in. Low-iron glass can be heat strengthened,  
tempered, sandblasted, etched, or assembled into laminated glass.  
Low-iron glass is used in areas where color rendition is critical,  
and for furniture, mirrors, museum display cases, signage, and  
where glass is to be back-coated with light-colored pigments.  
In the mid-twentieth century, a glass technique called dalle de  
verve was introduced. Glass dalles, slabs 8 by 12 by 1 in., are cast  
in hundreds of different colors. Dalles can be cut to any shape and  
used in combination with an opaque matrix of epoxy resin or rein-  
forced concrete 5/8 to 1 in. in thickness, to create translucent  
windows and walls of great beauty. Sizes are limited, and an outer  
protection glass is required.  
Glass rondels are handspun using techniques that date back to the  
Middle Ages. They are available as disks 3 to 14 in. in diameter or  
as square bull’s-eye sheets for restoration work.  
Textured patterned glass is also known as rolled or figured glass.  
It is made by passing molten glass through rollers that are etched  
to produce the design. Designs include flutes, ribs, grids, and other  
regular and random patterns, which provide translucency and a  
degree of obscurity. Usually only one side of the glass is imprinted  
with a pattern. Patterned glass can be silvered, sandblasted, or  
have applied colored coatings. One form of textured glass is  
impression glass, in which a clear resin, applied to the glass, is  
impressed with a pattern.  
Tempering and sheet size limitations for patterned glass must be  
verified. Patterning a glass surface may make tempering impossi-  
ble. Sheet sizes and thicknesses can vary greatly, depending on the  
type of pattern desired.  
Reflective glass reduces the amount of incident light transmitted,  
absorbed, and reflected by portions of the light and energy spec-  
trum, thus improving the energy balance within a building. Typically,  
Type I \(hard-coat or pyrolytic\) coatings, which are more scratch-  
resistant than Type II \(sputtered or soft-coat\) coatings, are used  
on exposed glass surfaces. Reflective coatings are derived from  
metals, and are applied to glass based on the glazing system  
requirements. Pyrolytic reflective coatings on the outside surface  
are susceptible to exterior environmental factors. Reflective coat-  
ings on inner surfaces are protected from damage. Reflective glass  
can be used in interior applications such as shower doors and  
enclosures, countertops, wall cladding, and furniture.  
There are two types of photovoltaic \(PV\) glass\: crystalline silicon  
sandwiched between two layers of glass, and thin-film amorphous  
silicon applied to an interior-facing glass surface. When these  
arrangements are exposed to sunlight, they generate either direct  
current \(DC\) or alternating current \(AC\) power, which is trans-  
ferred by concealed wiring to the building’s power system.  
Pressure bar framing systems or structural silicone, flush-glazed  
curtain walls and skylights, awnings, sunshades, light shelves, and  
roof panels are some of the systems that can incorporate PV glass.  
Both types of PV glass are used for opaque curtain-wall spandrel  
panels and can be used for curtain wall or skylight vision glass if  
the quality of daylighting and visibility is acceptable. Consult PV  
glass and metal-framing system manufacturers to determine avail-  
ability, suitability, and cost for a particular application.  
Tinted glass was developed to control solar heat gain and glare.  
Float glass is available tinted in green, bronze, gray, and blue, in  
thicknesses ranging from 1/8 to 1/2 in. The glass absorbs a portion  
of the sun’s energy due to its admixture content and thickness; it  
then dissipates the heat to both the exterior and the interior. The  
thicker the glass is, the greater the solar energy absorption.  
Newer tinted glass types allow more visible light transmission,  
while blocking a higher percentage of infrared energy than stan-  
dard tinted glass.  
Heat-absorbing tinted glass has a higher temperature when  
exposed to the sun than clear glass; the central area expands more  
than the cooler shaded edges, causing tensile stress buildup.  
Indoor shading devices such as blinds and draperies reflect energy  
back through the glass, thus increasing the temperature of the  
glass. Spaces between indoor shading devices and the glass,  
including ceiling pockets, should be vented adequately. Heating  
elements should be located on the interior side of shading devices,  
directing warm air away from the glass. Consider tilt-limit devices  
on horizontal blinds to allow for ventilation.  
Low-emissivity \(low-E\) glass was developed to address energy  
efficiency concerns for glazing. Hard or soft metallic coatings are  
applied to the glass, based on application type. Low-E coatings  
provide more reflectivity for the shortwave solar energy that strikes  
the glass at a high angle of incidence during the summer, while  
permitting this warmth to enter during the winter when the angle of  
incidence is lower. Low-E coatings are applied to the inside \(side 2\)  
on the first pane of glass in a double-glazed unit. The overall light  
transmission rate is higher than in tinted and reflective glass types.  
Blind glass is float glass that is acid etched on both sides in a lin-  
ear, offset pattern, obscuring visibility when viewed perpendicular  
to the glass. Visibility through the glass is possible when viewing  
at a 45° angle. Produced in 3/16- and 5/16-in. thicknesses, the  
thicker glass is more effective for a see-through effect, while the  
thinner glass is suited to areas requiring more privacy, such as in  
doors and in furniture applications.

Decorative stained glass is characterized by pieces of glass joined  
together with lead cames \(H-shaped strips\) of various widths.  
Varying the widths adds to the window’s decorative effect. Joints  
are soldered on both sides of the panel. To prevent leakage, a  
mastic waterproofing material is inserted between the glass and  
the came flange.  
Another method of joining the pieces of glass is to band the edges  
of the glass with a copper foil tape, burnished to the glass and then  
soldered with a continuous bead of solder on both sides.  
Insulating glass acts as a barrier to conductive heat loss. Insulated  
glass units are created by sealing an air pocket between two lights  
of glass, separated by a spacer. The energy efficiency of insulated  
glass can be increased by adding more layers of glass, or by the  
use of thin heat-reflecting films suspended between the spacers.  
New spacer types have been developed that provide a thermal  
break between the two layers of glass, for conditions in which  
there is a large temperature differential between the edges and  
the center of the glass. Stresses on the seal may cause the even-  
tual deterioration of the sealant, and moisture may appear as  
condensation between the glass layers.  
Insulated glass dampens vibrations and sound. Insulated glass  
units may be created to protect and seal specially treated glass,  
such as sandblasted glass surfaces.  
Electrochromic glass switchable privacy glazing, identified as  
polymer-dispersed liquid crystal \(PDLC\), consists of liquid crystals  
that are enclosed in transparent polymer capsules. The capsules  
are sandwiched between two sheets of transparent electroconduc-  
tive film. When voltage is applied, the liquid crystals line up in rows,  
allowing light to pass freely through the transparent film and glass.  
Without voltage, the liquid crystals do not line up in rows. This dif-  
fuses the light, making the glass appear opaque or obscure.  
X-ray shielding lead glass, super-heat-resistant glass for industrial  
uses, and other special-use glass types are available for custom  
applications. Consult manufacturers for information.

created. Thicknesses and overall sizes are dependent on the design  
and intended use for the cast glass. Cast glass products include  
glass tiles, stair treads, countertops, artwork, and glass panels.  
A channel-shaped translucent cast glass that can be used as an  
interior wall system is manufactured as a proprietary product. Its  
most common face dimension is about 10 in. wide, and its struc-  
tural capabilities allow it to be used in interior application heights  
of 20 ft. or more, providing a dramatic linear effect.  
Translucent linear glazing is nearly always installed double glazed,  
creating an airspace that offers a smooth appearance on both  
surfaces, and STC reduction of up to 42 dB. It is installed in a  
system of aluminum channels that can be finished to complement  
the surrounding conditions, or recessed into the perimeters for a  
flush appearance. The system can be curved, and glass-to-glass  
angled corners also can be easily installed, eliminating the neces-  
sity of any vertical metal framing at the interior glass area.  
varying levels of smoothness. The resulting granular-textured sur-  
face is susceptible to the absorption of oils. Fingerprints and dirt  
are typically visible on sandblasted surfaces unless treated with an  
applied sealer. The sandblasted surface may be protected by  
enclosing it within an insulated double-glazing unit.  
Sandblasting is the first treatment applied to glass, prior to addi-  
tional treatments. A sandblasted surface provides improved  
adhesion for applied sprayed coatings. Laminated glass may be  
sandblasted, but care should be taken so that the interlayer is not  
compromised.  
In the process of acid etching, sandblasted glass is submerged in  
a bath of hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids to create a hardened,  
sealed surface. The glass appears matte, with a soft, light-diffusing  
quality. Depending on the coarseness of the sandblasting grit, the  
etched texture may be relatively smooth or grainy. Acid-etched  
glass may be coated or silvered. It does not show dust, dirt, or  
fingerprints, and is used in retail, residential, and commercial  
applications for tabletops, counters, shelving, wall cladding, stair  
treads, and other interior architectural elements. Stencils and  
etching creams are available to etch smaller areas of glass for  
signage, mirrors, and windows.  
Multiple-layer glass units are formed by fusing compatible glass  
together under controlled heating. Various glass colors, textures,  
and compatible three-dimensional materials such as wire, stain-  
less steel, and copper screen can be incorporated into the fused  
unit. A texture or tack fuse maintains a degree of separation  
between the individual pieces of glass. A full fuse melts the various  
elements and layers into a uniform homogeneous form with a  
smooth surface with rounded edges. Different colors used in a  
full-fused piece will blend more than in a tack-fused piece. Coated  
and reflective glass may be fused onto glass substrates. Fused  
glass is typically used for furniture and decorative accents, glass  
borders, tiles, panels, light fixtures, and other interior elements.  
Hot glue is applied to sandblasted glass to create a fractured, ice  
crystal–like frosted effect known as glue chip glass. As it cools, the  
glue dries and shrinks, removing flakes of glass from the surface.  
Traditionally, horsehide glue was used for this process, but it has  
been replaced by synthetic glues. Greater pattern density can be  
created by a second application of the glue, resulting in a more  
obscure, frosted appearance. Clear or tinted glass may be glue  
chipped, and the glass may be tempered for added strength.  
Glass can be molded into various shapes when heated to provide  
the proper viscosity in a semimolten state. Slumped glass with  
thicknesses up to 3/8 in. will have the impression of the mold  
translated to the back side, while thicker glass units will be rela-  
tively smooth on the opposite side. Tinted or reflective glass types  
can be slumped, and processes such as gold leafing, silvering, and  
airbrushed coloring can be incorporated into the slumped glass  
texture. Panels up to 4 by 8 ft. are possible, and the slumped glass  
can be tempered if required. Molds are made of materials that can  
withstand the kiln-slumping temperature of approximately 1350°F.  
Tabletops, shower enclosures, wall panels, and signage can be  
created from slumped glass.  
To create decorative silk-screened \(frit\) glass, annealed clear or  
tinted glass is washed, and ceramic frit paint in standard or custom  
colors is silk screened on its surface in a standard or custom pat-  
tern or design such as dots, holes, lines, or a logo. The paint is then  
dried in an oven. The frit-coated glass is then subjected to very high  
temperatures in a tempering furnace to fire the ceramic frit perma-  
nently to the glass surface. As a result, silk-screened glass will be  
either heat strengthened or tempered after firing. Reflective and  
low-emissivity coatings can also be applied to the glass surface.  
Silk-screened glass can be used monolithically or for insulating or  
laminated glass products.  
A newer coating process for silk-screened glass uses water-based  
polymers. This material can be custom colored, and is available in  
metallic, crackle, frosted, and other custom finishes. This process  
is much more environmentally friendly than solvent-based coat-  
ings. The finish is cured in a low-temperature oven, and the glass  
may be tempered. Using this process, the glass may be cut, drilled,  
polished, and post-fabricated to suit project needs.  
A precise, strict-tolerance form of slumped glass is known as bent  
glass. Bent glass is often laminated to meet safety glazing  
requirements, and may be tempered. Some visual distortion may  
occur when the radius of the bent glass is tight. Curved shower  
enclosures, wall partitions, and automobile windshields are appli-  
cations for bent glass.  
A variety of other forms of glass, including clear, tinted, laminated,  
and wire glass, can be bent in thicknesses to about 1 in. and to a  
minimum radius of about 4 in. Sharp angle bends to 90°, edgework,  
pattern cutting, tempering that meets safety glazing standards,  
and heat strengthening are also available. Bent glass can be fabri-  
cated into insulating glass units. Bent glass tolerances must be  
compatible with the glazing system. Size, configuration, and prod-  
uct availability vary by fabricator.

Surface textures on glass soften transmitted light, add decorative  
designs, increase obscurity for privacy, or lightly fracture the glass  
surface for a frosted effect. Surface-texturing processes can be  
applied to clear, tinted, or reflective glass, prior to tempering.  
Epoxy coatings are typically applied to the back of glass units.  
Special printing techniques provide numerous design options on  
the glass. Coatings may contain glass beads and mica chips, which  
add a more reflective or metallic appearance. Special metallic  
coatings can be applied to increase glass reflectivity to light and  
heat and to carry an electric current.  
A dichroic coating is a metallic coating consisting of molecularly thin  
layers of titanium or zirconium that are highly reflective of one color  
wavelength of light, while transmitting an entirely different color.  
Dichroic coatings can be applied to clear or textured glass substrates.  
Size restrictions may apply due to the dichroic application process  
limitations. It is used in furniture, accent glass pieces, and art glass.  
Silicone coatings have been used for decades as a color backing  
for spandrel glass.  
Cast glass, also known as molded glass, is formed in molds, using  
combinations of colors and textures to create the desired product.  
Cast glass may be molded to precise dimensions and tolerances,  
or it may be formed into art glass units. The casting process allows  
an unlimited number of glass forms, colors, and textures to be  
Sandblasting is used to create a translucent frosted effect of a  
desired design on the glass surface. The glass is blasted with small  
abrasive particles of sand and high-pressure air projected through  
a nozzle. Different degrees of coarseness are used to achieve  
Applied films can be used to modify the appearance or perfor-  
mance of glass. Mylar films can be permanently bonded to the

glass with nonyellowing adhesives to create special designs. Tinted  
films are used as a low-cost alternative to tinted glass in retrofits  
of existing glass in commercial, residential, and automotive appli-  
cations. Clear, tough films are available with a Category II safety  
glazing alternative for glass that is too thin, textured, or shaped so  
that it cannot be tempered. Applied films are used in jewelry store  
windows and display cases, where additional protection is needed  
without affecting the visual quality of the glass. Nylon-fiber-  
reinforced adhesive-backed films are used on the backs of mirrors  
for wardrobe doors and wall cladding where safety is a concern  
but where tempering would cause unacceptable visual distortion.  
Polished edges are created either by machine or by hand, using  
progressively finer sanding grits with a final polishing with a cork  
belt impregnated with a polishing compound. If the glass is to be  
tempered, the sharp shoulders of the edge are sanded, or seamed,  
to remove small cutting nicks, chips, and sharpness. This treatment  
is necessary to minimize thermal stresses that may occur with  
small edge fractures. Edge finishing of laminated glass is typically  
done by hand to protect the soft interlayer, and is typically limited to  
flat or pencil polishing, in which the side edge is rounded. If a glass  
edge is flat polished, the shoulders are accentuated with a slight  
polished chamfer known as an arris on both sides of the glass.  
Mirrors are created by coating a piece of glass with a reflective  
coating of silver, backed with copper, and protected by an epoxy  
paint topcoat. Tinted and clear glass may be silvered with the  
pyrolitic process to produce mirrors.  
One-way mirrors are used for discreet observation, such as in  
lineup rooms in law enforcement facilities. These mirrors are cre-  
ated by the use of a special reflective coating, which allows  
approximately 12 percent transmission and is reflective to the side  
with the highest light intensity. Light on the observation side is  
reduced by a 10\:1 ratio, which maintains the reflective differential.  
One-way mirrors should be installed according to the manufactur-  
er’s instructions, and the lighting should be coordinated to provide  
secure one-way visibility.  
Beveled edges on glass surfaces change the reflection angle of the  
light and give a framed appearance to the glass. Bevels are ground  
onto the face of the glass with a succession of diamond grinding  
and polishing wheels. Beveled glass is tempered with the bevel  
side down toward the horizontal rollers. Thick glass with bevels  
more than 1 in. wide may slump and warp at the edges, due to the  
heat required for the glass thickness during the tempering pro-  
cess. Some inconsistencies can be polished out after the tempering  
process is complete.  
Fire-rated glass is a transparent ceramic product. It can be used  
in fire-rated partitions, in larger areas than typically permitted for  
wire glass. Consult local codes and manufacturer’s information for  
limitations.  
All fire-rated glass is listed and labeled by Underwriters Laboratories  
\(UL\). Fire ratings vary by type of fire-rated glass and thickness, but  
range from 20 minutes to 2 hours. Three-hour ratings are available  
with some insulated glass units. Thicknesses range from 3/16 in. for  
nonimpact locations, such as transoms, to 5/16 in. for laminated,  
impact-safety-rated fire-rated glass used in doors. Fire-rated glass  
may be polished, unpolished, or patterned \(obscure\).  
Fire-rated or fire/impact-safety-rated insulated glass units \(IGUs\)  
are composed of fire-rated glass and either tempered or annealed  
float glass. These units are available in tinted, low-E, reflective,  
one-way mirror, and art glass units. Consult manufacturers for  
specific unit types and applications.  
Fire-rated and impact-safety-rated glazing is available that has an  
intumescent gel layer between two panes of glass. When exposed  
to heat and light, the gel layer turns opaque and blocks the transfer  
of radiant heat through the glass for a short period of time.  
Special framing is required for fire-rated glazing installations,  
which must be compatible with the fire rating of the glass.  
Approved glazing compounds and fire-rated glazing tapes are  
required to maintain the rating of the installation.  
Waterjet cutting is a precise computer-controlled glass-cutting  
method. High-velocity water is forced through a small ceramic  
nozzle, combined with a fine abrasive used as a cutting medium. It  
is capable of cutting through multiple layers of glass and is useful  
when dissimilar materials such as metals are nested together with  
the glass. Tolerances are 0.001 in. Shapes too intricate to be cut by  
hand or traditional glass-cutting techniques can be waterjet cut.  
IBC 2406 covers glazing. In addition to the requirements for the  
use of glazing in fire-resistance-rated assemblies, the use of safety  
glazing is required in hazardous locations. Hazardous locations are  
those subject to human impact, such as glass in doors, shower and  
bath enclosures, and glass sidelights in partitions.  
Safety glazing is defined as glazing that meets the test require-  
ments of Consumer Product Safety Commission \(CPSC\) 16 CFR  
1201, Category II. Generally, tempered glass and laminated glass  
are considered safety glazing.  
This section begins by introducing the basic concepts and terminol-  
ogy encountered when working with interior doors. It goes on to  
examine common types of doors and special considerations such  
as fire safety.  
These are basic terms and concepts inherent to door design\:  
• Active leaf\: The primary operating leaf of a door pair.  
• Air curtain\: A mechanically produced downward stream of air  
across a door opening intended to prevent transmission of heat  
and weather.  
• Automatic closing\: A door that is normally open, but that closes  
without the necessity for human intervention, and is activated  
as a result of a predetermined temperature rise, rate of tem-  
perature rise, or combustion products.  
• Automatic door bottom\: A device applied to the back side of a  
door at the bottom, or mortised into the bottom edge of a door,  
which seals the undercut of a door as it is closed.  
• Balanced door\: A door equipped with double-pivoted hardware  
designed to cause a semi-counterbalanced swing action when  
opening.  
• Buck\: A subframe of wood or metal set in a wall or partition to  
support the finish frame of a door.  
• Casing\: The finished, often decorative framework around a door  
opening, especially that which is parallel to the surrounding  
surface and at right angles to the jamb.  
• Coordinator\: A device used on a pair of doors to ensure that the  
inactive leaf is permitted to close before the active leaf.  
• Door bevel\: The slight angle given to the lock stile \(vertical edge\)  
of a door, which prevents the door from touching the lock jamb  
as it swings. Typical bevels are\:  
• 1-3⁄8-in. door—none  
• 1-3⁄4-in. door—7⁄64 in.  
• 2-1⁄4-in.—9⁄64 in.  
• Double-egress door\: A pair of doors within a single special  
frame that swing in opposite directions to allow emergency  
egress from either side. Typically used where a fire or smoke  
partition crosses a corridor.  
• Flush bolt\: A door bolt set flush with the face or edge of the door.  
• Fire-door assembly\: Any combination of a fire door, frame, hard-  
ware, and other accessories that together provide a specific  
degree of fire protection.  
• Fire exit hardware\: Panic hardware that is listed for use on  
firedoor assemblies.  
• Head\: The horizontal portion of a doorframe above the door  
opening.  
• Jamb\: The vertical members at the sides of a door opening.  
• Labeled\: Equipment, products, or materials marked with the  
label, symbol, or other identifying mark of an approved testing  
organization that indicates compliance with standards for manu-  
facture and testing.  
• Listed\: Equipment, devices, materials, or services included in a  
list published by a testing agency that have been shown to meet  
applicable standards for use in fire-rated assemblies or that  
have been tested and found suitable for use for a specified  
purpose.  
• Panic hardware\: A door-latching assembly incorporating a  
device that releases the latch upon the application of a force in  
the direction of egress travel.  
• Power-assisted door\: A door with a mechanism that helps to  
open the door or to relieve the opening resistance of the door.  
• Prehung door\: Door and frame combination fabricated and  
assembled by the manufacturer and shipped to the site.  
• Sill\: The horizontal members at the bottom of a door opening.  
• Subcasing\: The finish frame components that support and guide  
the door.  
• Undercut\: The space between the bottom edge of a door and the  
sill or threshold.

• Overhead coiling  
• Coiling fire  
• Floor, wall, and ceiling access

Wood doors are available with face materials of wood veneer,  
composite veneer, high-density plastic laminate, medium-density  
overlay, and hardboard. Wood veneer on manufactured doors is  
available only in the species offered by the manufacturer, but cus-  
tom doors may be faced with any veneer available on the world  
market. Both reference standards listed later in this discussion  
require face veneers of at least 1⁄50 in., but thicker veneers may  
be specified. Veneers may be rotary cut, plain sliced, quarter-  
sliced, or rift cut, and may be matched with random, slip, and  
book-matched methods.  
• Composite veneers are manufactured by slicing sustainably  
grown hardwoods, and then vat-dying and pressing them into  
new, composite “logs.” The composite logs are then sliced to

form new veneers that replicate other natural woods. By using  
various colors of natural veneers and slicing angles of the com-  
posite log, a nearly unlimited number of simulated wood species  
and veneer patterns can be created. These veneers can be  
applied to doors in the same way as natural veneers.  
• Plastic laminate veneers provide a durable surface and are  
available in hundreds of available colors and patterns.  
• Medium-density overlay \(MDO\) faces are used to provide a  
smooth, paintable surface that resists grain raising and mois-  
ture. For this reason, they are often used for exterior doors.  
• Hardboard is used with three-ply construction for interior doors  
that are to be painted, and as a lower-cost option for MDO.  
The two main wood door standards are WDMA, I.S. 1-A, “Wood  
Flush Doors,” published by the Window and Door Manufacturers  
Association, and the “AWI Architectural Woodwork Quality  
Standards,” published by the Architectural Woodwork Institute.  
Generally, the WDMA standard is used to specify standard manu-  
facturers’ doors, while the AWI standards are used to specify  
custom doors. The Woodwork Institute of California also publishes  
standards in its Manual of Millwork .  
• Premium grade is specified when the highest level of materials,  
workmanship, and installation is required.  
• Custom grade is suitable for most installations and is intended  
for high-quality work.  
• Economy grade is the lowest grade and is intended for work  
where price is a primary factor.  
Despite these common grade names, however, there are some  
differences between the WDMA and AWI standards, which should  
be recognized during project design.  
Both WDMA and AWI standards classify doors into three grades\:  
Premium, Custom, and Economy.

Hollow metal doors are doors constructed from sheet steel  
attached to various types of cores. They are generally used in steel  
frames, also constructed of sheet steel bent into various profiles.  
To identify each of the several types of steel doors, the Steel Door  
Institute \(SDI\) uses a standard door design nomenclature. Many of  
these are shown in the accompanying Figure 12.83. Refer to SDI  
106, “Recommended Standard Door Type Nomenclature,” by the  
Steel Door Institute for a complete listing and for more information  
on door nomenclature and construction.

The hand, or the handing, of a door refers to the standard method  
of describing the way a door swings. Handing is used in the indus-  
try to communicate how a door swings and the kind of hardware  
that must be supplied for a specific opening. Some hardware is  
specific to the hand of the door due to the bevel on the strike side  
of the door. Hardware that works on any hand of door is called  
reversible or non-handed. Handing is determined by standing on  
the outside of the door looking at the door. If the door hinges on  
the left and swings away, it is a left-hand door.  
The corridor side is considered the outside of a room door, as is the  
lobby side of a door opening into a room or the room side of a  
closet door. When the distinction between outside and inside is not  
clear, the outside is considered the side of the door where the  
hinge is located.

Working with door cores requires an understanding of these concepts\:  
• Hollow-core versus solid-core doors\: Hollow-core doors are  
typically used in residential construction and for commercial  
doors subject only to light use. Institutional hollow-core doors,  
with heavier stiles and rails and with additional blocking, have  
increased strength and resistance to warping, but may cost as  
much as some solid-core doors. Solid-core doors are more  
secure, more durable, more resistant to warping, and allow less  
acoustic transmission. They are used in most institutional and  
commercial projects.  
• Door bevel\: Doors are beveled to allow the door to open past the  
jamb without binding. The standard bevel is 1⁄8 in. in 2 in.  
Generally, unit locksets are only available with the standard  
bevel; cylindrical locksets are available with either flat or stan-

• Bonded versus nonbonded cores\: Solid-core doors can either be  
bonded or nonbonded. With a bonded core, the stiles and rails  
are glued to the core material and the whole assembly is sanded  
as a unit before the faces are applied. This reduces the likeli-  
hood of telegraphing. With a nonbonded core, the elements can  
vary slightly in thickness and can telegraph noticeably through  
the faces. Five-ply doors are typically made with a bonded core,  
whereas seven-ply doors are made with a nonbonded core.  
Figures 12.95 through 12.98 show the most common core types.  
Other options are available, including structural composite lumber  
\(or laminated strand lumber\). The following are specialized cores  
that may be desired, dependent on the project requirements\:  
• Sound-insulating core\: A special core available in thicknesses  
of 1-3⁄4 in. and 2-1⁄4 in. The 1-3⁄4-in. core can provide a  
Sound Transmission Class \(STC\) rating of 36; the 2-1⁄4-in. core  
can achieve an STC of 42. Barrier faces are separated by a void  
or damping compound to keep the faces from vibrating in uni-  
son. Special stops, gaskets, and threshold devices are also  
required.  
• Lead-lined core\: A special core consisting of 1⁄32-in. to 1⁄2-in.  
continuous lead sheeting edge-to-edge inside the door con-  
struction. This material may be reinforced with lead bolts or  
glued.  
Both wood and hollow metal doors are available in a variety of  
standard widths. Custom doors can be fabricated in any size, but  
it is generally best to design around standard door sizes.  
Flat panels are typically three-ply hardwood or softwood. Raised  
panels are constructed of solid hardwood or softwood built up of  
two or more plies. Doors 1 ft-6 in. wide or less are one panel wide.

Panel doors consist of a framework of vertical \(stile\) and horizon-  
tal \(rail\) members that hold solid-wood or plywood panels, glass  
lights, or louvers in place.  
The doors are made of solid or built-up stiles, rails, and vertical  
members \(muntins\), typically doweled per applicable standards.  
Dependent of location, common species include ponderosa pine,

fir, hemlock, or spruce and hardwood veneers. Hardboard, metal,  
and plastic facings are available in various patterns.  
Most building codes require all glass in doors to be safety glazed.  
Insulated safety glazing is available for increased thermal or  
acoustic performance.  
The core and edge strip materials are similar to those used in  
flush doors. Face veneer is typically hardwood at 1⁄8-in. minimum  
thickness.  
Typical profiles used for trim work include cove, bead, or ovolo.  
Glass doors are constructed primarily of glass, with fittings to hold  
the pivots and other hardware. Their strength depends on the glass  
rather than the framing. Glass doors are generally constructed of  
1⁄2-in. or 3⁄4-in. tempered glass.  
Glass doors may be installed within an opening or as part of an  
all-glass entrance system. If used alone, glass doors may be set  
within a wall opening with or without a frame, or they can be  
installed between glass sidelights. The same type of fitting used on  
the door is generally used for sidelights. Although jamb frames of  
aluminum, wood, or ornamental metal can be used, they are not  
necessary, and the glass sidelights can be butted directly to the  
partition.

The minimum configuration for a glass door requires some type of  
door pull and a corner fitting at the top and bottom \(sometimes  
called the shoe\) to hold the pivots. Some manufacturers provide  
hinge fittings that clamp on the glass and support the door in much  
the same way as a standard hinged door.  
If the door is used for egress, the local building code may require  
the use of special hardware that allows the door to be locked from  
the outside but still allows the door to be unlatched and opened  
from the inside with a single push on a push bar. Glass doors are  
heavy and may require a power operator or a balanced door  
system.  
All-glass entrances, commonly used for interior storefronts,  
include glass doors and surrounding glazing that does not use vis-  
ible framing members. Instead, special fittings are used to clamp  
adjacent glass pieces together and to support the glass doors. The  
glass, typically 1⁄2-in.- or 3⁄4-in.-thick, is installed in channels set  
in the floor and above the ceiling. Glass fins, for additional lateral  
support, may be placed perpendicular to the main glass plane and  
attached with silicone joint sealant.

Based on use characteristics, there are four main types of latches  
and locks\:  
• Passage\: Latches can be operated by a handle from either side  
at all times.  
• Privacy\: The outside handle is locked by a push-button inside \(or  
if a deadbolt latch, by a turn\) and unlocked by an emergency key  
outside.  
• Entry\: The outside handle is made inoperative by mechanical  
means, other than a key, on the inside. The latch bolt is operated  
by a key on the outside handle or by manual means at the inside  
handle.  
• Classroom\: The outside handle is locked from the outside by a key.  
When the outside handle is locked, the latch bolt may be retracted  
by a key from the outside or by rotating the inside handle.  
In all cases, the latch bolt can be operated by a handle from either  
side.

Use three hinges for doors as tall as 7 ft-6 in. Add one hinge for  
each additional 30 in. in height.  
In specifying hinges, these design criteria are important\:  
• Door material, weight, and dimensions  
• Hinge weight \(standard or heavy\), material, finish, and special  
features \(e.g., swing clear, spring hinge, etc.\)  
• “Clearance” \(i.e., distance between door and frame when door  
is opened 180°\)  
• Frequency of use, conditions of use \(e.g., exterior, corrosive  
atmosphere, potential for abuse or vandalism, etc.\)  
• Type of pin tips  
• Type of screws

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
Pivot hardware, either center or offset, is recommended for use  
when the appearance of hinges is unacceptable. Pivot hardware is  
used most often with frameless, nonrated door assemblies \(i.e.,  
glass doors\). Pivots are used in pairs, with the bottom pivot con-  
cealed in the floor and the top pivot concealed within the door  
head. This arrangement also allows the closer hardware to be  
concealed at either of these locations.  
Center-pivot hardware allows the door to swing in either direction,  
unless restrained by the closer mechanism or a stop. Offset-pivot  
hardware allows the door to swing in one direction. Tall, heavy  
doors require offset pivot hardware, as intermediate pivots must  
be included for additional support on heavy doors or to prevent  
door deflection and consequent warping on tall doors.  
When properly installed and adjusted, a door closer should control  
the door throughout the opening and closing swings. It combines  
three basic components\:  
• A power source, to close a door  
• A checking source, to control the rate at which the door closes  
• A connecting component \(an arm that transmits the closing  
force from the door to the frame\)  
In all modern closers, the power source is a spring, and the check-  
ing source is a hydraulic mechanism. The spring and checking  
mechanisms are connected to a common shaft, and arms attached  
to this shaft act as a linkage to communicate movement between  
the door and mechanism. In addition to serving as linkage, the  
arms, through leverage, can amplify the power of the spring, pro-  
viding maximum power at the latch point.  
Additional features for safety and convenience also are available  
in many types of closers. These include back check, delayed action,  
adjustable spring power, and a variety of hold-open functions  
\(regular, fusible link, and hospital\).  
A full range of closer sizes are available to suit various door  
dimensions, locations, and job conditions. The manufacturer’s  
recommendations should be considered carefully.  
Closers with delayed-action features give a person more time to  
maneuver through doorways. They are particularly useful on fre-  
quently used interior doors such as entrances to toilet rooms. The  
ADAAG requires a closing speed of at least three seconds; ANSI  
requires five seconds.  
A combination fire and smoke detector, door holder, and closer is  
available. Ionization, photoelectric, or heat-sensing devices detect

smoke or any combustion products, and either hold open or close  
the door. Smoke and fire doors are most commonly held open by  
electromagnetic or pneumatic devices and are released and  
closed manually or by means of smoke- or fire-detection devices.  
Most jurisdictions do not allow the old-fashioned fusible-link door  
closer in areas of human occupation, except for overhead doors.  
Some hold-open devices incorporate an electric switch that allows  
building maintenance staff to turn off the hold-open feature; how-  
ever, such a switch should never shut off the detector.  
Requirements for closers and detectors vary by code and govern-  
ing jurisdiction. Refer to local building codes, the life-safety code  
of the National Fire Protection Association \(NFPA\), and other  
applicable regulations.  
A combination closer and holder will hold the door in the open  
position when incorporated with an independent detector or when  
wired into any type of fire-detecting system. This type of unit has  
unlimited hold-open from 0° to approximately 170°, or limited hold-  
open from 85° to 170° for cross-corridor doors.

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
Access flooring creates a chase underneath the floor for wires,  
cables, and sometimes an air distribution plenum. Access flooring  
systems are often used in general offices, data centers, computer  
rooms, and clean rooms. Multilevel access flooring systems are  
available that incorporate two or more continuous cavities beneath  
the floor panels to house wireways and an air distribution plenum.  
Access flooring consists of panels and an understructure system.  
Bolted-down panels are directly connected to pedestal heads by  
fasteners located in panel corners. Because the fasteners must be  
accessible to remove panels, floor coverings must be either remov-  
able or permanently attached to panels and of a type that can  
accommodate exposed countersunk fasteners. Carpet tile is gener-  
ally selected for the former condition, and either high-pressure  
plastic laminate or resilient tile for the latter. Bolting panels to  
pedestals improves the entire system’s lateral stability and adds  
resistance to rocking and overturning. The latter effect can result  
where partitions are fastened to panels and are subject to unbal-  
anced loads that are not resisted by ceiling connections or other  
means.  
Solid wood flooring is available in many hardwood and softwood  
species. It can be refinished multiple times. It should not be  
installed below grade, due to the possibility of moisture damage to  
the wood floor.  
Wood strip flooring for normal use is typically a nominal 3⁄4-in.  
thick, with an actual thickness of 25⁄32 in., in widths ranging from  
1-1⁄2 to 2-1⁄4 in. Lengths are random.  
Wood plank flooring is also typically a nominal 3⁄4-in. thick, in  
widths ranging from 3 to 10 in., and is available in random lengths.  
There are two types of access flooring understructures\: low-profile  
systems and pedestal systems.  
• Low-profile systems provide a low-height access floor \(typically  
less than 4 in. high that does not significantly encroach on space  
height. In these systems, closely spaced plastic or metal sup-  
ports incorporate cable management systems and provide sup-  
port at regular intervals across the panel.  
• Pedestal systems are composed of either a threaded rod or a  
telescoping tube, which support the panel at the corners \(or at  
the edge at the floor perimeter\). It is considered good practice to  
adhere pedestal bases to the subfloor to resist horizontal forces.  
There are two basic types of pedestal systems\: stringerless and  
stringer systems.  
Stringer systems are offered with either bolted or snap-on \(non-  
bolted\) stringers. The purpose of stringers is to provide additional  
lateral support, particularly where panels are frequently removed  
or where finished floor heights or earthquake loads exceed those  
that can be accommodated by stringerless systems. Two panel  
types are available for stringer systems\: bolted and snap-on  
stringers.  
Bolted stringer systems consist of main stringers, usually two to  
three modules long, and cross stringers, one module long, which  
are bolted to pedestals. These stringers may or may not support  
panel edges.  
Stringerless systems consist of pedestals located so that each  
pedestal head supports four panels at their corners. Stringerless  
systems provide maximum access to the underfloor cavity.  
Stringerless understructures can be less stable laterally than  
those with stringers and are less capable of withstanding lateral  
forces from earthquakes and other sources; consequently their  
use is limited to lower finished floor heights. Two-panel types are  
available for stringerless pedestal systems\: gravity-held and bolt-  
ed-down panels.  
Snap-on stringer systems consist of stringers, each one module in  
length, located under the edge of each panel and interlocking with  
pedestal heads without using threaded fasteners; this makes the  
removal of grid members more convenient because no tools are  
needed. The disadvantage of snap-on stringers is that with fre-  
quent use they do not provide the same degree of restraint as  
bolted stringers.  
Wood flooring should be selected after considering pedestrian and  
vehicular \(cart\) traffic, durability required, and potential damage to  
floors; typical usage, exposure to moisture and sunlight, mainte-  
nance, wood floor appearance expectations, and other criteria  
specific to the project.  
The majority of woods specified for commercial flooring are hard-  
woods such as oak or maple. Best overall appearance, uniformity  
of color, limited amounts of character marks, and minimal sap  
marks indicate the most desirable wood flooring.  
Figure 12.118 lists the typical grades and sizes of boards by spe-  
cies or regional group. Grade classifications vary, but in each case  
it can be assumed that the first grade listed is the highest quality  
and that the quality decreases with each succeeding grade. The  
best grade typically minimizes or excludes features such as knots,  
streaks, spots, checks, and torn grain, and will contain the highest  
percentage of longer boards. Grade standards have been reduced  
in recent years for most commercially produced flooring, hence a  
thorough review of exact grade specifications is in order when  
selecting wood flooring.  
Gravity-held panels are secured in place by nesting on an interlock-  
ing connection formed in both the panel and the pedestal head. This  
system provides the quickest access because no tools other than a  
panel lifter are required to remove panels.  
Engineered wood flooring is available in strip, plank, or parquet  
tiles. Hardwood face veneers are laminated to a dimensionally  
stable, multiple-ply substrate. Engineered wood floors are not as  
susceptible to moisture as solid wood flooring, and may be used in  
below-grade areas, with the proper installation techniques.  
Wood flooring consists of solid or engineered wood products and  
is available in strip, plank, and parquet. All wood floors require  
regular maintenance to preserve their appearance. Wood flooring  
industry organizations and suppliers provide detailed information  
on product specifications.

Wood flooring requires particular care in handling and installation.  
Prior to installation, the wood flooring should be allowed to accli-  
mate to the space in which it is to be installed, at the humidity level  
of the final occupancy. Minimize moisture damage to wood floors  
by avoiding installation in close proximity to wet areas. In addition,  
to ensure constant temperature and humidity, install wood floors  
after all “wet” jobs have been completed and after the heating  
plant and all permanent lighting have been installed.  
Wood flooring is subject to expansion and contraction; therefore,  
perimeter base details that allow for movement and ventilation are  
recommended. Wood structures require adequate ventilation in  
basements and crawl spaces. Under a slab on or below grade,  
moisture control can be further enhanced by use of a vapor barrier;  
this provision should be carefully considered for each installation.  
Wearing properties of wood flooring vary from species to species  
and should be considered along with appearance when specifying  
wood floors. In addition, grain pattern affects the durability of a  
given species. For example, industrial wood blocks are typically  
placed with the end grain exposed because it presents the tough-  
est wearing surface. The thickness of the wood above the tongues  
in tongue-and-groove flooring may be increased for extra service.  
Wood floors are installed over a plywood subfloor or over wood  
sleepers. Strips or planks are blind-nailed in tongue-and-groove  
installations and face-nailed in butt-jointed installations; parquet  
floors are commonly set in mastic. Vapor barriers are installed  
when the installation is slab-on-grade or below grade. Ventilation  
is required in certain installation conditions where moisture is a  
concern. Special conditions require additional detailing for proper  
installation.

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
Ceramic tile is made from either natural clay or porcelain, and is  
glazed or unglazed.  
• Porcelain tile is a ceramic mosaic or paver tile generally made  
by the dust-pressed method. It is dense, impervious, fine-  
grained, and smooth, with a sharply formed face.  
• Natural clay tile is a ceramic mosaic or paver tile with a distinc-  
tive, slightly textured appearance. It is made by the dust-  
pressed or plastic method from clays that have a dense body.  
• Glazed tile has an impervious facial finish of ceramic materials  
that is fused to the body of the tile. The body may be nonvitreous,  
semivitreous, vitreous, or impervious.  
• Unglazed tile is a hard, dense tile of uniform composition  
that derives color and texture from the materials used in its  
fabrication.  
There are a variety of tile types, including ceramic mosaic, quarry,  
paver, decorative, mounted, and conductive tile.  
Nonvitreous More than 7.0% Natural clay Not for use in  
continually wet  
locations  
Semivitreous More than 3.9%,  
but not more than  
7.0%  
Natural clay Not for use in  
continually wet  
locations  
Vitreous 0.5% to 3.0% Natural clay For use in  
continually wet  
locations  
Impervious 0.5% or less Porcelain For use in  
continually wet  
locations; superior  
wear resistance  
Ceramic mosaic tile is formed either by the dust-pressed or the  
plastic method. Usually 1⁄4- to 3⁄8-in. thick with a facial area of  
less than 6 sq. in., it may be made of either porcelain or natural clay  
and may be plain or have an abrasive mixture throughout.  
Resilient wood flooring is commonly used in athletic facilities. The  
typical wood flooring species for sports facilities is maple, pre-  
ferred for its density, fineness of grain, and no splintering qualities.  
Beech and birch are also used by some manufacturers for resilient  
wood floors. Finishes are typically transparent, and supplemental  
markings may be added with approved materials and techniques  
for floor striping and logos.  
The Maple Flooring Manufacturers Association \(MFMA\) provides  
detailed information on the features, installation, and maintenance  
for maple flooring. Wood sports floor systems vary from one  
manufacturer to another, and some are engineered for specific  
purposes, such as aerobics use. Some systems are proprietary and  
protected by patents. The information contained in this section  
refers to typical resilient wood flooring systems. Consult manufac-  
turers for specific information.  
Resilient wood flooring is commonly milled into tongue-and-  
groove-shaped strips of random length. Typical thickness is 25⁄32  
in. for most general-purpose resilient wood flooring. An 11⁄32-in.  
thickness is available from selected manufacturers when addi-  
tional loads are anticipated and where usage is expected to be  
more severe than normal. Widths range from 5-1⁄2 in. to 3-1⁄4 in.  
Quarry tile is glazed or unglazed tile made by the extrusion process  
from natural clay or shale. It usually has a facial area of 6 sq. in. or  
more. Quarry tile may be specified with abrasive grit embedded in  
the surface, for use in areas where slip resistance is a concern.  
Paver tile is glazed or unglazed porcelain or natural clay tile formed  
by the dust-pressed method with a facial area of 6 sq. in. or more.

Decorative thin-wall tile is a glazed tile with a thin body that is usu-  
ally nonvitreous. It is suitable for interior decorative residential use  
when breaking strength is not a requirement.  
Many types of tile are used as floor finishes including\: ceramic,  
quarry, glass mosaics, plastic, and metal. Ceramic tile is fabricated  
from clay or a mixture of clay and ceramic materials. Natural clay  
is most commonly used, but porcelain is also available. Porcelain  
tile is fine-grained and smooth and can be formed into sharply  
detailed designs. Tile dimensions are typically nominal. Refer to  
manufacturers’ data for specific tile and trim piece dimensions.  
Mounted tile is assembled into units or sheets to facilitate handling  
and installation. Tile may be face-mounted, back-mounted, or edge-  
mounted.  
Material applied to the face of the tile is usually easily removed, but  
material bonded to the back is integrated to the tile installation.  
12.124 ANSI A 137.1, “Specification for Ceramic Tile,” quantifies the  
four levels of water absorption for tile. The density and porosity of the  
tile determine its capability to absorb moisture. In general, the lower  
the water absorption level, the better the stain resistance of the tile.

Epoxy mortar and grout are used where moderate chemical expo-  
sure and severe cleaning methods are used, such as in food pro-  
cessing plants.  
Movement in the structure and the substrate must be accommo-  
dated by the ceramic tile installation. For quarry tile and paver tile,  
a movement joint width should be the same as a grout joint, but not  
less than 1⁄4 in.; for ceramic mosaic tile and glazed wall tile, a  
movement joint should be not less than 1⁄4 in. In addition to  
expansion joints, there are several types of movement joints, as  
follows\:  
• Control joints or contraction joints are formed, sawed, or tooled  
grooves in the concrete substrate, used to create a weakened  
location where the controlled cracking of the concrete can occur.  
• Construction joints are located where two separate placements  
of concrete meet and where reinforcement may be continuous.  
• Isolation joints are installed where adjoining areas of a con-  
crete substrate may move in three directions and where the  
formation of cracks is to be avoided.  
• Cold joints are formed when the size of a concrete slab is too  
large for one pour and successive pours are required. Cold  
joints may crack with movement of the slab. Some slabs are  
saw-cut at regular intervals to provide controlled cracking  
locations.  
Backup strips are flexible and compressible types of closed-cell  
foam polyethylene, butyl rubber, or open-cell and closed-cell poly-  
urethane. These strips should be rounded at the surface that  
comes in contact with the sealant.  
Sealants used are silicone, urethane, or polysulfide. Silicone seal-  
ants are used on interior vertical tile surfaces. Mildew-resistant  
silicone sealants are useful in wet areas. Urethane sealants are  
used in interior horizontal tile installations. Sealants should comply  
with ASTM C 920, “Standard Specification for Elastomeric Joint  
Sealants.”  
All expansion, control, construction, cold, and seismic joints in the  
structure should continue through the tile work, including such  
joints in vertical surfaces. Joints installed through tile work  
directly over structural joints must never be narrower than the  
structural joint. Expansion joints should be installed in the follow-  
ing circumstances\:  
• 24 to 36 ft. in each direction  
• Tile work exposed to direct sunlight or moisture, 12 to 16 ft. in  
each direction  
• Where tile work abuts restraining surfaces such as perimeter  
walls, dissimilar floors, curbs, columns, pipes, ceilings, and  
where changes occur in backing materials

Stone flooring is available in two basic types\: dimension stone,  
which is installed in a thick mortar bed, and dimension stone tiles,  
which are installed in a thick mortar bed or in a thinset installation,  
similar to ceramic tile installations.  
Joint width should always be specified; 1⁄16 to 1⁄8 in. is consid-  
ered standard. When installing stone flooring over a wood subfloor,  
the floor should be reinforced to ensure against deflection.

# ELEMENT C\: INTERIORS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION  
Lippage is a condition that occurs when tiles are installed with a  
thin bed over an uneven surface. Tiles may “lip” one edge higher  
than adjacent tiles, presenting a ragged appearance on the fin-  
ished surface. In some conditions, a certain amount of lippage is  
unavoidable. As a general rule, the recommended maximum varia-  
tion of the finished surface should be no more than 3⁄16 in.,  
cumulative over a 10-ft lineal measurement, with no more than  
1⁄32-in. variation between individual tiles.  
Stone tile modules are typically 12 to 24 sq. in. by 1⁄4, 3⁄8, or 1⁄2  
in. thick, and typically are furnished with a protective backing to  
improve the tile strength. Dimension stone for stair and threshold  
applications are typically custom-sized.  
Dimension stone is defined as quarried stone with usually one or  
more mechanically dressed surfaces. These are thick slabs of  
stone that are marked as they are cut for matched-pattern instal-  
lations, such as book-match or end-match configurations.  
Dimension stone tiles are less than 3⁄4 in. thick. They provide the  
natural beauty of a stone floor without the weight, depth, and  
expense of dimension stone. However, their thinness makes stone  
tiles more prone to cracking from impact or normal floor deflection.  
Stone tiles are installed either by the thick-bed or the thinset  
installation method.  
Stone flooring can vary in sizes from large paver units with face areas  
up to 48 sq. in. by 3⁄4, 1-1⁄4, or 2 in. thick to small stone tiles.  
Sizes and shapes are limited by the specific stone’s characteristics.  
Stone finishes affect the perception of the color and the slip resis-  
tance of stone flooring. Common stone finishes are polished,  
honed, and thermal.  
• Polished finishes are the most reflective. These high-maintenance  
finishes should be selected with care. For high-traffic public  
areas, such as lobbies, polished floor finishes are often eventu-  
ally hidden under nonskid mats.  
• Honed finishes have a dull sheen. These satin-smooth surfaces  
are often good choices for commercial floors because of their  
slip resistance.  
• Thermal finishes, sometimes called flamed finishes, are  
achieved by the application of intense flaming heat to the sur-  
face of the stone. Thermal finishes are usually applied to granite.  
• Waterjet is a newer type of finish for granite, which is between  
honed and thermal finishes. Created by high water pressure, the  
waterjet finish brings out the color of the stone, making it  
slightly darker than the thermal finish.

12.128 Abrasive Hardness \(HA\) value, is the reciprocal of the volume of  
the material abraded multiplied by 10. A minimum value of 10 is recom-  
mended for flooring. Stones with a difference of 5 or more in HA should  
not be used together because they will wear differently.

Since its introduction in the early 1950s, tufting has transformed  
the carpet industry. Compared to other carpet construction meth-  
ods, tufting does not require skilled labor and requires less expen-  
sive equipment to manufacture. It is also far less expensive and  
faster to produce than woven carpet. This process has enabled the  
mass production of an affordably priced, wide-width textile floor  
covering.  
The tufted construction process is similar to sewing. Hundreds of  
needles stitch simultaneously through a backing material. To hold  
the tufted loops in place, the underside of the primary backing is  
coated with latex backing adhesive, a rubbery substance that dries  
hard but remains bendable. A secondary backing material is then  
applied.  
• Primary backing materials are the woven or nonwoven fabrics  
into which the tufts are inserted. They are typically olefin-based,  
either plain-woven or spun bonded. A thin polymer coating is  
often applied to bond the warp and weft threads and to minimize  
unraveling. Spun bonded olefin is inherently resistant to fraying  
or unraveling. During the tufting process, the olefin fibers are  
pushed aside, minimizing the distortion of the backing. This helps  
ensure a uniform pile height. Backings made of olefin are imper-  
vious to moisture and are mildew-resistant.  
• Adhesives used in tufted carpet are usually synthetic latex,  
although molten thermoplastic compounds are also used.  
Adhesives permanently anchor the tufts to the primary backing,  
preventing snags and unraveling.  
• Secondary backing materials, sometimes referred to as scrims,  
provide dimensional stability to the finished tufted carpet. A  
secondary backing is added for strength and stability. Secondary  
backing materials are often made of polypropylene, which is  
popular because it is moisture-resistant. Alternatives to second-  
ary backings are attached carpet cushions, solid vinyl compos-  
ites, and coatings referred to as unitary backings.  
The standard dimension of most manufactured tufted carpet is a  
12-ft width, although some manufacturers provide 6 and 15-ft  
widths for special applications.

Terrazzo is a very low-maintenance, seamless floor finish with the  
luxurious look of stone mosaic and durability comparable to that of  
concrete. Often selected for its decorative possibilities, terrazzo  
artistry can produce striking medallions or intricate inlaid patterns.  
Terrazzo is a mixture of a binder and crushed aggregate, typically  
marble. Other aggregate types, such as glass, are available to vary  
the appearance of the terrazzo. Divider strips of brass, white alloy  
of zinc, or plastic, are used functionally as control joints, and aes-  
thetically as design elements, to separate fields of color.  
Aggregate, or stone chips used in terrazzo, includes all calcareous  
serpentine and other rocks capable of taking a good polish. Marble  
and onyx are the preferred materials. Quartz, granite, quartzite,  
and silica pebbles are used for rustic terrazzo and textured mosa-  
ics not requiring polishing.  
The specification of carpet and carpet tile requires evaluation of  
the following\:  
• Carpet construction, which includes tufted, fusion-bonded,  
woven, hand-tufted, knitted, and needle-punched processes  
• Carpet fiber  
• Carpet performance characteristics, including face and total  
weight, pile density, and appearance retention  
• Density  
• Thermal and acoustic considerations  
• Installation  
• Carpet cushion  
Carpet construction refers to the carpet manufacturing method.  
The three most popular construction methods for commercial car-  
pet construction are tufting, weaving, and fusion bonding. Knitted  
and needle punched carpets are available but less often specified.  
• Tufted carpets account for as much as 95 percent of the carpet  
produced in the United States.  
Carpet tiles provide ready access to a raised floor or easy replace-  
ment when soiled or worn. Carpet tile backing systems provide  
moisture barriers from the base of the pile yarn to the floor, pre-  
venting spills from penetrating to the subfloor. Backing materials  
include polyvinyl chloride \(PVC\), amorphous resins, and polyure-  
thane cushion. The “hard backs” \(PVC and amorphous resin\) offer  
dimensional stability and seam and edge integrity for easy pattern  
matching. PVC backings are used most often for modular tiles.  
Carpet tiles are installed with standard adhesives, releasable  
adhesives, and mill-applied peel-and-stick adhesives. Carpet tile  
installation is easier and causes less downtime and productivity  
loss than traditional carpet installation. Systems furniture divider  
panels and office furniture do not have to be removed, but are  
simply lifted with a “jack” system. The tiles are then installed  
underneath the furniture while it remains in place.

Weaving, the traditional carpet construction method, produces  
carpet on a loom, integrating the pile and backing yarns during the  
carpet construction. Most woven carpet is dimensionally stable as  
a result of the weaving process and does not require a secondary  
backing, as tufted carpet does. Weaving accounts for less than  
2 percent of the carpet market in the United States. Its primary use  
is in the hospitality industry, where long-term durability and intri-  
cate pattern detail are primary considerations. The three basic  
types of weaving processes are velvet, Wilton, and Axminster.  
Density, the amount of pile yarn in unit volume of carpet, is influ-  
enced by gauge—stitches per inch across the width—yarn size or  
thickness, and pile height. A larger yarn can be tufted at a wider  
gauge and receive the same density as a fine yarn at a small gauge.  
For areas where heavy foot traffic is likely, a density of 5000 to 7000  
or more may be necessary. Office spaces with moderate traffic  
require a density of 4000 to 6000. Because of the fundamental dif-  
ferences in the manufacturing processes, different terms are used  
to describe carpet density for each type of carpet construction.

II Heavy 500–1000 As in the construction of woven carpet, the knitting process inte-  
grates pile and backing yarns in one operation. Needles are used  
to interlace yarns in a series of connecting loops, similar to the  
hand-knitting process. Knitted carpets are known for their plush  
piles, because there is more yarn in the wear surface than tufted  
carpets. Knitted carpet has a tendency to stretch, however, espe-  
cially on the diagonal, and is difficult to seam during installation.  
Knitted carpet represents a very small percentage of the carpet  
produced in the United States.  
Needle punching is achieved by layering thick fiber batts, typically  
polypropylene, over a support fabric. Hundreds of barbed needles  
punch through the support fabric, compressing and entangling the  
fibers. Needle punched carpets are permeable, which presents a  
problem when liquids are spilled on a wall-to-wall interior installa-  
tion. The most common application of needle punched carpet is  
outdoor carpet.

Several types of carpet fibers are used.  
Acrylic was one of the first synthetic fibers to be used successfully  
in the production of carpet. However, because the color and texture  
of acrylic fiber can be glossy and harsh, and because acrylic carpet  
pile crushes easily, it is no longer recommended for use as a com-  
mercial carpet fiber.  
Nylon is the most popular carpet fiber. It has excellent wearability,  
abrasion resistance, and resilience, and solution-dyed nylon is also  
resistant to harsh cleaning chemicals and sunlight fading. However,  
because of nylon’s excellent durability, appearance retention is a  
concern. Long before a nylon carpet wears out, its appearance may  
be permanently ruined.  
Polypropylene is the lightest commercial carpet fiber. Polypropylenes  
are known for their excellent stain and mildew resistance, low  
moisture absorbency, excellent colorfastness in sunlight, and high  
strength. They also minimize static electricity. Olefin is a polypropyl-  
ene. Polypropylene is commonly used in outdoor carpeting.  
Polyester fibers are known for their color clarity and their capabil-  
ity to retain color. More popular for residential carpet applications  
than for commercial uses, polyester has a luxurious feel.  
Used for centuries in the manufacturing of carpet, wool is still the  
standard against which other carpet fibers are judged. It is gener-  
ally the most expensive carpet fiber and is commonly used in woven  
carpets. When exposed to flame, wool chars, rather than melting  
like most synthetic fibers, making it naturally flame-resistant. It  
also dyes well and has good resistance to soil and wear.  
Sisal is a strong, woody fiber produced from the leaves of the  
agave plant, which is found in Central America, the West Indies,  
and Africa. Used mostly in twine and rope, it has become a popular  
contemporary flooring fiber.

There are two types of carpet installation\: stretch-in and adhesive.  
For broadloom carpet, there are three types of adhesive installa-  
tion\: direct glue-down, double glue-down, and the newest installa-  
tion type, self-stick. Releasable adhesives can facilitate carpet  
repair or replacement.

Stretch-in installation is the traditional method of carpet installa-  
tion, whereby the carpet is stretched over a cushion and attached  
at the perimeter with a tack strip. This is the most common instal-  
lation method for residential applications, and is used commer-  
cially for woven wool carpets and in areas where underfoot  
comfort and luxury are required \(e.g., hotel lobbies and board-  
rooms\). Stretch-in applications allow for easy removal and  
replacement of the carpet and cushion. Because stretch-in carpet  
is secured only around the perimeter, such installations can ripple,  
causing accessibility problems, hence they may not be appropri-  
ate for large areas and heavy commercial or rolling traffic.  
Power stretchers are used to put the carpet in tension and stretch  
it drum-tight. The carpet should be stretched to its fullest to with-  
stand changes in temperature and humidity and other stresses.  
Cushion selection should be coordinated with the carpet manufac-  
turer to ensure that the carpet warranty is not voided.

Common methods of adhesive installation include\:  
• Direct glue-down\: The most common method of commercial  
installation, direct glue-down is economical and practical. The  
carpet is glued directly to the floor without a cushion. This is the  
most dimensionally stable installation method and is often  
required for stair or ramp applications, even if different instal-  
lation methods are specified for other areas of the project.  
Proper substrate conditions are imperative for a successful  
glue-down installation. Uneven substrates can cause irregular  
wear patterns.  
• Double glue-down\: This installation method combines the  
underfoot comfort of stretch-in installation with the stability of  
the direct glue-down method. The carpet cushion is adhered to  
the floor, and then the carpet is glued to the cushion. With either  
the direct or the double glue-down method, admitting traffic

before the adhesive has had time to cure can cause the instal-  
lation to fail. Hardboard or plywood is typically recommended  
as protection for an adhesive installation, because covering a  
new adhesive installation with plastic sheeting may prevent  
proper curing and cause mold or mildew to develop.  
• Self-stick\: This is the latest development in carpet installation  
techniques. A flexible adhesive layer is applied to the carpet  
backing and is covered with a protective plastic film. The labor  
involved in adhesive application and the time required to ensure  
the proper tackiness are eliminated. This carpet type typically  
comes in smaller widths, about 6 ft., for ease of manipulation  
during layout and installation.

There are three methods of carpet tile installation\: free-lay, full  
glue, and with a tile that has a pre-applied pressure-sensitive  
adhesive coating. In free-lay installations, a strip of adhesive is  
applied about every 15 ft. and around the room perimeter. Tiles in  
those areas are anchored in place, and surrounding tiles are butt-  
ed snugly against each other. Full-glue installations should be  
specified where heavy or wheeled traffic is anticipated. In this  
case, tiles are typically installed with a “stair-step” technique. The  
installation “grows” from the center of the room.

Resilient flooring provides a dense, nonabsorbent, pliant surface  
that is generally quiet, comfortable to walk on, and easy to maintain.  
Resilient wall base and flooring accessories are available in three  
materials\:  
• Vinyl can be susceptible to shrinking when exposed to heat.  
• Thermoplastic rubber is a vinyl compound with a comparatively  
small amount of rubber added for flexibility. Because of the high  
vinyl content, it performs similarly to vinyl, but is more flexible.  
It is commonly more expensive than vinyl but less expensive  
than vulcanized, thermoset rubber.  
• Thermoset rubber is vulcanized natural rubber. It is the most  
flexible resilient base material and thus is easier to install and  
better at hiding surface imperfections in walls and floors.  
Thermoset rubber base is susceptible to color degradation due  
to UV exposure; however, it can be specially manufactured with  
UV inhibitors. White and dark-colored thermoset rubber base  
tends to hold color best. Lighter colors, especially gray, tend to  
be prone to color degradation. Thermoset rubber base also  
tends to be more vulnerable to scuffing than vinyl or thermoplas-  
tic rubber. Lighter colors tend not to show scuff marks as much  
as darker colors.  
Although most building codes do not have flammability require-  
ments for wall trim that constitutes less than 10 percent of the wall  
surface, the flame-spread ratings and the smoke generated from  
burning resilient flooring accessories differ among the three mate-  
rials. Thermoset rubber, when burned, generates less smoke and  
toxic fumes than vinyl or thermoplastic rubber.

The five basic ingredients used in the manufacture of vinyl flooring  
are\:  
• Polyvinyl chloride \(PVC\), which imparts wear resistance and  
durability. PVC is the basis of the binder, which constitutes most  
of the wear surface. The binder consists of PVC compounded  
with plasticizers and stabilizers.  
• Plasticizers, which increase flexibility.  
• Stabilizers, which provide color permanence and stabilize the  
pigments against heat and light deterioration.  
• Fillers, which are added to supplement the bulk and thickness of  
the flooring. Mineral fillers, the most common, improve fire  
resistance. Natural fillers increase slip resistance.  
• Pigments, which are used for color.  
Sheet vinyl flooring, either solid vinyl or backed, forms a continuous  
finished floor covering. Because sheet vinyl flooring has fewer  
joints, it is used for applications where spills, dirt, or bacterial  
growth are of concern. It is commonly specified in hospital operat-  
ing rooms or other areas where resistance to bacterial growth or  
water penetration is required.  
There are two types of seams for sheet vinyl installations\: heat  
welded and chemically welded.  
• Heat-welded seams are formed by melting a vinyl rod between  
sheets. Solid-color or patterned welding rods can either accent  
or camouflage seams. Heat welding requires special equipment  
and trained installers.  
• Chemical welding is accomplished with the application of a one-  
or two-part solvent that is mixed on-site. This softens the edges  
of the vinyl, essentially melting them together. Chemical welding  
is more economical than heat welding.  
Two types of vinyl tile are solid vinyl tile and the less expensive vinyl  
composition tile \(VCT\). Solid vinyl tile, or homogeneous vinyl tile,  
contains much more PVC than VCT, making it more resilient and  
resistant to abrasion. Homogeneous vinyl tile has superior indenta-  
tion and rolling/load resistance. Because the pattern is continuous  
through the thickness of the flooring, its appearance will remain  
consistent when worn.  
Three classes of VCT are defined by ASTM F 1066, “Standard  
Specification for Vinyl Composition Floor Tile”\: Type 1, solid-color  
tiles; Type 2, through-pattern tiles; and Type 3, surface-pattern  
tiles.  
Cork tile with  
vinyl coating  
12″ × 12″  
Rubber sheet or rubber tile flooring is composed of natural rubber  
or synthetic rubber \(styrene butadiene\), mineral fillers, and pig-  
ments. Two types of rubber floor tile are homogeneous and lami-  
nated.  
• Homogeneous rubber tile has coloring uniform throughout the  
tile thickness.  
• Laminated rubber tile has coloring or patterning in the wear  
layer only.  
Linoleum \(derived from the Latin terms for “flax,” linum, and “oil,”  
oleum\) is composed primarily of linseed oil, obtained from the flax  
plant. The oil is oxidized and mixed with a natural resin, such as  
rosin tapped from pine trees, and combined with powdered cork  
for flexibility and limestone for strength and hardness. Wood flour  
and pigments are added for color and colorfastness. For dimen-  
sional stability, this mixture is bonded to a fiber backing \(typically  
burlap\) for linoleum sheets, or to a polyester backing for tile. Felt  
backings are used for linoleum countertop or tack surface sheets.  
Cork flooring is harvested from the outer layer of cork oak trees  
grown in Mediterranean regions. When the bark becomes loose,  
approximately every nine years, it is cut away. Composition cork is  
the most common form of cork flooring. The bark material of the  
cork oak is granulated, pressed with binders such as synthetic  
resins, and then baked. The quality of composition cork varies  
according to the quality and size of granules, the type and quantity  
of the binder, and the density \(compression\) of the mix.

Wall base conceals the joint where the wall meets the floor.  
Premolded inside and outside corners are available from some  
manufacturers, but they may differ in texture and color from  
straight sections. Straight sections of resilient wall base are avail-  
able in precut lengths \(4 ft. long\) and coils \(approximately 100 ft.  
long\). Coils minimize the number of joints and may reduce installa-  
tion costs.  
There are three basic wall base profiles\:  
• Straight base is meant to be used with carpet.  
• Cove base is meant to be used with resilient flooring.  
• Butt-to-base, sometimes referred to as sanitary base, is avail-  
able from a limited number of manufacturers. It is installed prior  
to the finish floor covering. The finish floor covering must be of  
the same thickness as the butt-to-base flange.  
The base is sealed to the floor and wall, creating an easy-to-clean,  
more sanitary joint, which is popular for healthcare applications.  
Cove moldings support sheet vinyl, sheet linoleum, or other flexible  
floor coverings when coved up the wall. Cap moldings help to finish  
the exposed edges of coved floor coverings, ceramic tile, or wood  
paneling.

A wide range of interlocking resilient floor grid systems are avail-  
able for wet and high-impact areas such as weight rooms, aerobics  
studios, and other athletic facilities, as well as kennels and stables.  
Systems are available for both indoor and outdoor applications.  
Increasingly, flooring construction is specialized to specific athletic  
applications; for example, air-supported martial arts flooring is  
available. In addition, individual removable mats ranging from 4 to  
6 ft. wide are available in a variety of lengths for particular ath-  
letic applications.  
Fluid-applied flooring systems provide seamless, durable coatings  
over concrete and other rigid substrates for commercial, industrial,  
and institutional applications. They are usually installed with an  
integral self-cove base. Consult with manufacturers for final selec-  
tion of products for specific applications. These systems must be  
applied by trained, experienced installers who have been recom-  
mended or approved by the components’ manufacturers.  
Floor grille and grating systems, available in a wide range of  
styles, are used in an increasing variety of building applications. A  
recessed built-in system is a more permanent way to catch and  
hold dirt particles, providing protection at the building entrance.  
• Recessed systems are generally less than 1 in. deep.  
• Shallow pit systems are 1 to 3 in. deep.  
• Deep pit systems are more than 3 in. deep.  
A typical grille or grate system is made up of a series of interlock-  
ing rails that run perpendicular to the traffic direction. Types of  
tread surfaces include serrated aluminum, abrasive or nylon car-  
pet, and rubber or vinyl filled. Rails should be able to handle heavy  
rolling loads. Continuous drainage between rails allows dirt and  
moisture to fall into the recess. Failure to routinely maintain the  
system will create an uneven recess, resulting in an unstable  
surface and causing a potential tripping hazard and possible dam-  
age to the system. Most systems contain recycled content.  
Grating types include plank, bar, expanded, extruded, and molded;  
materials include steel, aluminum, and fiberglass. Where struc-  
tural strength is paramount, steel is the prevalent material; where  
corrosion and high-impact resistance is important, fiberglass grat-  
ing is often used.

After review of the planned illumination levels, it may be possible  
to reduce the number of light fixtures within a space, thereby  
reducing initial installation costs and long-term energy costs.  
Light-reflectance values are generally lower for those acoustic tiles  
with textured and embossed patterns. Integrally colored tiles may  
affect the LR value. Unless the ceiling surface is to be used as a  
distributor of illumination, lower LR values may not be of concern.  
Beveled edges, often found on reveal-edged units, form an eased  
edge condition, which softens the line of the perimeter of the  
panel. When moving panels after the initial installation, beveled  
edges can minimize edge damage due to accidental bumping of the  
panel on the grid.  
Acoustic panel ceilings are composed of manufactured units,  
installed in a metal suspension assembly. They are used where  
sound attenuation and accessibility to the above-ceiling interstitial  
or plenum space are desired. Acoustic ceilings are large visual  
elements within a space, and so are considered design elements  
as well as acoustic features. Partitions, light fixtures, ceiling diffus-  
ers, sprinklers, and other devices are attached to or installed  
within these ceilings, so coordination with the ceiling layout is  
critical.  
Acoustic panels are installed on an exposed metal grid system  
suspended from the underside of the structure above. In contrast,  
acoustic tiles are inserted to a concealed suspension system and  
are generally 12 by 12 in. and 24 by 24 in. Common acoustic panel  
sizes range from 24 by 24 in. to 24 by 48 in. up to 60 by 60 in., and  
are available in rectangular and square shapes. Thicknesses range  
from 5⁄8 in. to 3⁄4 in. to 1 in., with other thicknesses available for  
special applications. Most manufacturers provide hard metric-size  
acoustic panels to address global needs for their products.  
Acoustic panel ceiling products are available to meet special proj-  
ect requirements, including the need for greater durability, light  
reflectance, and humidity resistance. Fire-resistant acoustic ceiling  
assemblies are available, when used with applicable UL designs.  
ASTM E 1264, “Classification for Acoustical Ceiling Products,”  
provides a classification system for ceiling panels that describes  
various attributes of the panels; this is a very useful standard  
when using the descriptive method of specifying.  
Acoustic ceiling panels are available to address special needs.  
Food service areas often require products that are accepted by  
the USDA for food preparation areas. Nonperforated mylar-faced  
or vinyl-faced acoustic panels with appropriate suspension sys-  
tems can be installed in food service areas as well as in clean-  
rooms of certain classes. Acoustic properties of these mylar- or  
vinyl-faced products are less than those of nonfaced products;  
therefore, a check of the local regulations for these installations  
is recommended.  
Composite ceramic and mineral fiber panel products perform well  
in areas such as indoor pool areas, hydrotherapy areas, laborato-  
ries, and other spaces where corrosive materials may be present.  
The suspension system grid and hangers should be of a corrosion-  
resistant material such as aluminum or stainless steel, to minimize  
deterioration.  
Several of the same types of acoustic tile are also employed as  
acoustic panels\: water-felted, cast, or molded and nodular. Special  
acoustic panels composed of a ceramic and mineral fiber compos-  
ite are used where increased durability, cleanliness, and resis-  
tance to humidity and fumes are required. Mylar-faced acoustic  
panels are used in cleanroom areas, food service, and other  
applications where cleanability is important.  
Fiberglass panels are processed from a molten state into fibrous  
glass strands, then formed into sheet/board stock. A separate  
dimensionally stable facing material is laminated to the fiberglass  
core to provide texture and pattern. Backings are available to  
improve acoustic qualities of the fiberglass panels. The availability  
of recycled content is increasing within acoustic panel manufactur-  
ers’ product lines, depending on the product selected. To address  
the issue of sustainability within the manufacturing process many  
manufacturers are now recycling old ceiling panels.  
In open office areas, the installation of an acoustic panel ceiling  
will improve the amount of privacy between partial-height parti-  
tioned workstations. Within closed areas, an acoustic panel ceiling  
can improve the transmission of noise from one room to another, if  
used with appropriate partition types. Manufacturers of acoustic  
tile ceilings categorize the acoustic features of their products  
according to industry standard designations for the ratings of  
sound absorption. Ceiling Attenuation Class \(CAC\) and Noise  
Reduction Coefficient \(NRC\) both rate sound absorption.  
• CAC \(formerly known as CSTC, Ceiling Sound Transmission  
Class\) rates a ceiling’s efficiency as a barrier to airborne sound  
transmission between adjacent spaces and from above-ceiling  
elements. Shown as a minimum value, a ceiling with a high CAC  
may have a low NRC.  
• NRC rates the average sound absorption coefficient measured  
at four frequencies\: 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz, and rates the  
capability of a ceiling to absorb sound, measured from 0.0 to  
1.00\. The higher the number, the greater the capability of the tile  
to absorb sound.  
• AC rates the listener’s ability to understand the spoken word  
within a space, expressed as a decimal, with 1.0 being perfectly  
intelligible. The AC rating measures the sound attenuation of a  
ceiling in open office areas with partial-height partitions and  
workstation furniture panels, without the use of a sound-masking  
system.  
Exposed acoustic ceiling panel suspension systems are composed  
of main and cross-tee components, installed at the desired height  
by hanger wires. The suspension system is typically fabricated  
from factory-coated steel. Additional types include galvanized steel  
systems for improved resistance to moisture, and aluminum and  
stainless steel for other special installation requirements. Fire-  
rated suspension systems are available, with prenotched expan-  
sion relief segments to resist suspension system failure resulting  
from heat expansion of the grid.  
Common edge details are square or reveal shapes. Acoustic panels  
with these edge details are easily dropped in place within the  
suspension system and are pushed up to access the ceiling ple-  
num.  
Square-edge acoustic panels are economical and are installed on  
the exposed ceiling suspension grid flanges. Square-edge panels  
do not conceal the suspension grid.  
Reveal edge acoustic panels allow the panels to extend below the  
suspension system, partially concealing the metal grid. Tegular  
edges can be square, angled, beveled, stepped, or other special  
shapes, and are generally selected for their aesthetic appearance.  
When installed within an exposed tee suspension system, the acous-  
tic panels “read” as modular elements, due to the reveals between  
the panels. Other suspension system profiles fill the tegular-edge  
reveal, providing a more flush, monolithic appearance to the ceiling.  
The visible components of an exposed ceiling suspension system  
include interlocking main beams and cross tees, installed in a  
prescribed grid to accept the acoustic panels. Main beams are  
typically installed on hanger wires spaced at 4 ft. o.c. along the  
beam. Angle or channel-shaped moldings are used for perimeter  
acoustic panel support.  
Hanger wires support the main and cross tees from the structure  
above and are spaced per the manufacturer’s recommendations  
and as project conditions require.  
Other special accessory components of the exposed suspension  
system include stiffeners, clips, spacers, covers, and adapters.  
Although it may be difficult to identify all of the specific accessory  
components, the major items anticipated on a project, such as  
hold-down clips, stiffening braces, partition clips, and so on, should  
be identified, if possible. Specifications should cover accessories  
as well as the overall suspension system and acoustic panels.

The quantity of light reflected by a surface, defined in ASTM E 1477,  
“Standard Test Method for Luminous Reflectance Factor of  
Acoustical Materials by Use of Integrating-Sphere Reflectometers,”  
is known as light reflectance. Illuminance is measured in foot-  
candles, or lux \(metric measure\). One foot-candle is approximately  
10 lux. A foot-candle is the average illumination resulting when one  
lumen of light falls on 1 sq. ft. of surface. The total number of  
lumens on a surface divided by the area of the surface equals foot-  
candles.  
High-light reflectance \(LR\) acoustic tiles provide greater reflected  
light from the ceiling plane. LR is measured in values from 0.00 to  
1.00\. High LR ceiling tiles are particularly effective in open office  
areas with indirect light sources, where glare is reduced at the  
work plane and where spaces incorporate daylight as a light  
source. Usable light is increased and is more evenly distributed.  
Acoustic ceilings that have a light reflectance above 0.83 are  
considered to be high light-reflectance ceilings, but some prod-  
ucts are available that exceed this number and reflect more light.

Fire-resistance-rated suspension systems conform to the UL design  
for fire-rated performance. Expansion points are provided at spe-  
cific intervals to alleviate stresses on the grid in case of fire. Cross-  
tee end clips and other devices must be used as required by UL and  
local codes. The acoustic panels installed within the fire-resistance-  
rated suspension system must also be of a fire-resistive nature.  
Z-shaped grid components. The suspension system is typically  
fabricated from factory-coated steel or as galvanized steel sys-  
tems for improved resistance to moisture.  
Concealed suspension systems for acoustic tiles integrate above-  
ceiling access areas into the system. Access is upward or down-  
ward, depending on the system. Care should be taken to prevent  
damage to the ceiling tile during installation and maintenance of  
the system and above-ceiling elements.  
For the installation of an acoustic panel ceiling with seismic design  
requirement locations, review suspension systems with cross-tee  
end details that accommodate lateral movement. Check with ceil-  
ing suspension system manufacturers to determine the seismic  
capabilities of a particular system.  
Ceiling suspension systems for acoustic tiles are designated as  
light-, intermediate-, or heavy-duty. Light-duty systems are used  
where there will be no additional loads other than the acoustic  
tiles; therefore, these systems are typically used only in residential  
and light commercial applications. Intermediate-duty systems are  
capable of supporting a moderate amount of additional load, such  
as light fixtures and ceiling diffusers. Intermediate-duty systems  
are commonly used in standard commercial applications. Heavy-  
duty systems can accommodate additional loads suspended from  
or installed within the ceiling system. Prior to specifying a suspen-  
sion system, the anticipated loads on the ceiling should be  
reviewed to determine the most suitable type.  
Acoustic tile ceilings are composed of prefabricated ceiling units,  
which are installed in a concealed or semi-exposed metal suspen-  
sion system. Also known as concealed spline ceilings, they are  
directly installed on a substrate by stapling or adhesive bonding.  
Although acoustic tile installations provide a monolithic ceiling sur-  
face, installation can be more costly, and maintenance of the tile  
ceiling is more difficult than with acoustic panel installations. An  
acoustic tile ceiling is not as easily accessible to above-ceiling areas  
as acoustic panel ceilings with lay-in units. If accessibility is not an  
issue, an acoustic tile ceiling is an option when the aesthetics and  
other conditions of the installation are appropriate for the project.  
Acoustic tiles are typically 12 by 12 in.; however, larger sizes are  
available. Thicknesses range from 1⁄2 in. to 5⁄8 in. to 3⁄4 in. Hard  
metric sizes are available on a more limited basis from manufactur-  
ers. Acoustic panels are generally larger than 12-by-12-in. ceiling  
tiles, and are installed in exposed or semiconcealed grids.  
Fire-resistant acoustical tile assemblies are available when used  
with applicable UL design criteria. Consult a manufacturer’s prod-  
uct information for specific recommendations on acoustic panel  
ceiling data.  
The concealed suspension system is composed of interlocking  
15⁄16-in.-wide double-web main beams and cross tees. Main  
beams are typically installed on hanger wires spaced at 4 ft. on  
center along the beam. Angle or channel-shaped moldings are used  
for perimeter acoustic tile support. Hanger wires support the main  
and cross tees from the structure above and are spaced per the  
manufacturer’s recommendations and as project conditions  
require. Accessory components such as clips and concealed angles  
are available to allow access to the plenum space above the ceiling.  
Composition of the various acoustic tile types used in commercial  
construction include mineral fiber base and glass fiber base.  
Cellulose base, used primarily in residential construction, is not as  
durable as the commercial-grade panel construction. Construction  
of the mineral fiber base acoustic panels is cast, wet-felted, and  
nodular, and is available in a number of textures and acoustic  
properties.  
Water- or wet-felted tiles are fabricated from mineral wool, per-  
lite, fillers, and binders, which are mixed into a loose slurry that is  
formed into sheets by draining, compressing, drying, and cutting  
to size. Fissured, perforated, or stippled textures are added to the  
tiles prior to painting the units.  
Isolation hangers isolate ceilings from noise traveling through the  
building structure. Hangers are also available for isolating ceiling  
systems to shield spaces from mechanical equipment and aircraft  
noise.  
When it is necessary to isolate a high-noise area from a building,  
or a “quiet room” from a high surrounding noise level, floors,  
walls, and ceilings should be built free of rigid contact with the  
building structure, to reduce sound and vibration transmission.

Cast or molded tiles are fabricated from mineral fibers, fillers, and  
binders, then mixed into a pulp and poured into paper or foil-lined molds  
of the desired size. Surface textures are created by the manipulation of  
the surface of the molds. Integral colors can be added for a through-  
color product. The tiles are oven-dried, trimmed, and then painted.  
For the installation of an acoustical tile ceiling with seismic design  
requirement locations, review suspension systems with cross-tee  
end details that accommodate lateral movement. Check with ceil-  
ing suspension system manufacturers to determine the seismic  
capabilities of a particular system.  
Nodular tiles are fabricated from mineral fibers wound into balls,  
combined with perlite, fillers, and binders, then mixed into a slurry.  
The mixture is formed into sheets, oven-dried, and cut to size. The  
tiles, which are inherently porous, are then textured with fissures  
and painted.  
There are a variety of wood products used for ceilings, including  
beadboard, wood decking or planks, and wood-finished ceiling  
panels.  
Concealed acoustic tile ceiling suspension systems are installed at  
the desired height by hanger wires, which support the metal T- or

Beadboard, 5/16 in. thick and around 3-1/2 in. wide, can be used  
for ceilings. A routed groove down the center of each plank creates  
the illusion of two narrow planks when installed. Beadboard is  
installed at right angles to the ceiling joists. Edges at walls are  
easily trimmed with molding.  
Wood decking or planks span beams to form the structural plat-  
form of a floor or roof. The underside of the planks may be left  
exposed as the finished ceiling. Wood planks are typically 5-1/4 in.  
wide and have V-shaped tongue-and-groove joints. Channel groove,  
striated, and other machined patterns are available. There is no  
concealed ceiling space with such a system.  
Wood ceilings are often finished with stains and varnishes. A dark  
ceiling finish, especially a shiny one, may appear lower than it actu-  
ally is. Combined with a dark-colored floor, it can create the illusion  
of a flat, horizontal space.  
Wood ceilings made from light-colored or highly patterned woods,  
like knotty pine, can add warmth and character to a space. In some  
cases, wood ceilings are painted, either to reflect more light or to  
obscure unattractive wood.  
Wood ceilings are usually highly sound reflective. Sometimes  
designers use lattices or baffles of wood in an attempt to improve  
sound absorption. Such efforts may improve sound diffusion but  
must be topped with acoustically absorbent materials in order to  
significantly increase sound absorption.  
Ceiling panels with wood veneer finishes are also available.  
Perforated wood-finished panels can have acoustically absorbent  
material inside. The panels are edge banded and some open down-  
ward for ease of access.  
Manufacturers of ceiling panels provide wood and faux wood  
options. Standard 2 by 2 ft. metal ceiling panels can be inexpen-  
sively powder coated with realistic printed images of wood.  
Suspended wood linear ceilings are attached with clips to a rail.  
They are available in a variety of wood species, including oak, ash,  
maple, poplar, and red cedar, with factory-applied finishes.  
Suspended drywall and plaster ceilings can be framed with conven-  
tional framing materials or with a drywall suspension system.  
Metal framing typically includes the use of a carrying channel and  
furring or hat channel suspended by 8- or 9-gauge hanger wire.  
Steel stud framing typically includes the use of metal studs sus-  
pended by 8- or 9-gauge hanger wire.

Linear metal ceilings are distinctive in appearance and are used  
where strong linear aesthetic, durability, and ease of maintenance  
are desired. Metal surfaces are available with many finishes and  
colors, which allow for a number of design options for the metal ceil-  
ing. Special suspension systems allow custom radius configurations,  
as well as flat horizontal ceilings, to be installed. Linear metal ceilings  
are typically installed as snap-in units on a concealed suspension  
system, and some can accept companion integrated light fixtures.  
Linear metal ceilings are fabricated from aluminum, steel, or stain-  
less steel. Options include metal panel \(slat\) sizes, metal coating  
types, colors, textures, and acoustic insulation. Linear baffle ceil-  
ings are also available, but typically are not installed with acoustic  
insulation.  
The most common material for linear metal ceilings is roll-formed  
aluminum, with typical thicknesses of 0.020 in., 0.025 in., and 0.032  
in. Aluminum linear panels are preferred for high-humidity areas  
and in spaces where the environment fluctuates, as well as for  
exterior applications. Roll-formed steel linear panels are available,  
and they can be more economical than aluminum, but are not as  
commonly used due to concerns about maintenance over time.  
Stainless steel also performs well but is typically more costly than  
aluminum or steel panels.

Guardrails act as fall protection and are required adjacent to any  
elevation drop of 2 ft-6 in. or greater. The required height of any  
guardrail is 3 ft-6 in., minimum. If the rail has openings, the spac-  
ing must be such that a 4-in. diameter sphere cannot pass through  
the openings. If there were a danger of objects falling from the  
floor level, then a toe kick would also be required to prevent this  
occurrence. A handrail incorporated with the guardrail is only  
required on stairs or ramps. The guardrail design must meet the  
required design stresses of rails, posts, and panels. The structural  
value of fasteners and anchorage to the building structure for both  
vertical and horizontal forces must be verified.  
Wall guards, panels, and trim are typically attached to a finished  
wall surface with adhesive or screws. For all wall and corner guard  
installations, it is important to provide backup blocking behind  
areas where fasteners are attached, particularly for handrail-type  
guards.

This section discusses interior construction for toilets and baths,  
locker rooms, and showers.  
When selecting toilet enclosures, screen types, and mounting  
styles, consider requirements for maintenance, vandal and mois-  
ture resistance, supporting construction, and methods for repair-  
ing damaged units.  
Toilet compartments are often categorized by finish or construc-  
tion. Common materials from which compartments and cubicles  
are fabricated include\:  
• Metal, which includes stainless steel and steel with a baked  
enamel finish.  
• Polymers, including plastic laminate, phenolic core, melamine  
faced particleboard cores; fiberglass-reinforced panels \(FRP\)  
with particleboard cores; and solid-surfacing veneers  
• Stone  
Factory-finished hardwood units, which are generally used exclu-  
sively for high-end installations, are also available. Moreover,  
materials may be combined—for example, compartments may  
have plastic-laminate doors and panels with stainless-steel pilas-  
ters. Baked enamel and plastic laminate panels are also available  
with stainless steel edge strips.  
Taller-than-average doors and panels may be required to help  
ensure privacy. Assemblies that incorporate a lap joint at doors and  
pilasters to eliminate vertical sight lines into compartments are  
available from an increasing number of solid-polymer and pheno-  
lic-core unit manufacturers. Some metal units can be modified to  
include stops and fillers, to eliminate vertical sight lines at doors.

Interior signage is a critical element in the success of interior  
spaces. Signage is used as a means of wayfinding, where users are  
provided with a system of navigational cues to guide them through  
an architectural environment. Interior signage is the most impor-  
tant component of this navigation system, used for information,  
direction, destination identification, and depiction of regulatory  
conditions and emergency locations, such as stair exits. Emergency  
exit signage, generally covered under base building interior con-  
struction and governed by code requirements, is not included in  
this discussion.  
Interior signs may be visual, tactile, digital, or a combination of  
multiple information techniques. Local codes and ADA/ABA  
Accessibility Guidelines provide information on regulated sign  
types.  
Interior signs may be freestanding, wall mounted, floor mounted,  
or suspended from overhead ceilings or structures. Signs may be  
framed or unframed, custom designed, and fabricated or specified  
from a premanufactured modular sign product line.  
The ADA/ABA Accessibility Guidelines establish guidelines for  
accessible signage. All signage required to be accessible must  
meet these requirements, as well as any applicable local or state  
accessibility standards.  
Accessible signs must be provided in permanent rooms and spac-  
es. Directional, informational, and overhead signs do not require  
tactile and Braille lettering, but they must meet ADA/ABA  
Accessibility Guidelines criteria.  
• Signs identifying rooms and spaces, whose function will not eas-  
ily or readily change, must include tactile and Braille text. An  
office identification sign with a temporary room occupant may  
include a nonaccessible name plaque in addition to the acces-  
sible room identification sign.  
• Wall-mounted signs that provide direction to or information  
about functional spaces are not required to include tactile and  
Braille lettering. However, they must meet requirements for  
character proportion and height, sign finish, and contrast.  
• Signs that are projected or suspended overhead must meet  
requirements for clearance, character proportion and height,  
sign finish, and contrast.  
• Building directories, menus, and all other signs that provide  
temporary information about rooms and spaces, such as the  
current occupant’s name, are not required to comply with ADA/  
ABA Accessibility Guidelines.

The fireplace and chimney are usually large elements in residenc-  
es, but their scale can be adapted to any architectural style.  
Although the purpose of the residential fireplace has changed over  
the years from heating to decoration, increasing public interest in  
renewable forms of energy has instigated a new demand for fire-  
places for heating homes.  
Fireplace design and construction are governed by building and  
mechanical codes. The fireplaces shown in Figure 12.368 indicate  
the required parts and their vertical organization. The main func-  
tion of the fireplace and chimney is to sustain combustion and  
carry smoke away safely. Their design is based on empirical data  
proven with years of safe performance.

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES CONVEYING  
# CONVEYING  
Conveying equipment may include elevators, escalators, and mov-  
ing walks; dumbwaiters, lifts, turntables, scaffolding, conveyors,  
facility chutes, and pneumatic tube systems.  
Conveying equipment is used to move people, equipment, and  
freight along horizontal and vertical paths. Conveying equipment  
makes access within large buildings practical by minimizing effort  
and travel time and can also be used to control access for privacy  
and security. The physical area and typical expense for conveying  
equipment usually impact the basic planning of a building and may  
control some aspects of the overall design. The speed at which  
these systems operate must be balanced against the occupants’  
waiting time in conjunction with potential physical unease caused  
by rapid or jerky movement.  
Conveying systems are also important elements of universal  
access for occupants of differing physical abilities and so must  
comply with relevant accessibility standards. Safety is critical, in  
particular where shafts, openings, or operating parts may pose a  
danger to occupants; therefore maintenance procedures involve  
frequent inspection and, potentially, regular recertification by build-  
ing authorities. Regulations are especially critical for elevators.  
Other general design factors relate to matching equipment size,  
speed, and capacity with occupant type, demand load, and level of  
convenience.  
Codes may forbid placement of equipment not associated with the  
elevator in the machine room.  
Components of an elevator system include a hoistway, a machine  
room, an elevator car, and waiting lobbies for passenger, equip-  
ment, or freight loading.  
The hoistway is an open vertical shaft for the travel of one or more  
elevator cars. It includes a pit and usually terminates at the under-  
side of the machine room in a traction assembly, and at the under-  
side of the roof over the hoistway in a hydraulic assembly. Typically,  
access to the elevator car and hoistway is through hoistway doors  
at each floor, serviced by the elevator. Hoistway design is deter-  
mined by the characteristics of the elevator system selected, along  
with requirements for fire separation, ventilation, soundproofing,  
and nonstructural elements.  
Guided by vertical rails on each side, the elevator car conveys  
passengers or freight between floors. It is constructed within a  
supporting platform and frame. Design of the car focuses on ceil-  
ing, wall, floor, and door finishes and accompanying lighting, venti-  
lation, and elevator signal equipment.  
The car and frame of a hydraulic elevator are supported by a piston  
or cylinder. The car and frame of an electric traction elevator are  
supported by cables draped over the hoist machine. The elevator  
and its counterweight are connected with steel ropes or belts.  
Elevator waiting areas are designed to allow free circulation of  
passengers, rapid access to elevator cars, and clearly visible ele-  
vator signals. Elevator lobbies may be required to be enclosed—  
depending upon facility design and codes.  
Both electric traction and hydraulic elevators require a location for  
elevator operating machinery. Due to current technology advances,  
operating machinery for hydraulic elevators has become smaller  
and often can be located within the hoistway. When a designated  
machine room is required, for either electric traction or hydraulic  
systems, fire separation, adequate ventilation, and soundproofing  
are required, along with self-closing and self-locking doors. The  
machine room for an electric traction elevator is usually located  
directly above the hoistway, but could also be situated below, to the  
side, or to the rear of the hoistway; this room contains elevator  
hoisting machinery and electronic control equipment. Machine  
rooms for hydraulic elevators, normally located near the base of  
the hoistway, contain a hydraulic pump unit and electronic controls.  
Generally there are two types of elevators, hydraulic and electric  
traction. Both of these elevator types can be used for various  
applications in a range of building types—including passenger,  
freight, and residential applications.  
Mechanized movement of occupants and materials within a build-  
ing enables designers to organize, divide, and compartmentalize  
areas into distinctly separate zones that are accessible only  
through controlled portals employing elevators or escalators. Such  
separation can increase security, provide individual occupancies,  
and structure circulation sequences, such as arrival, greeting, and  
destination. These systems are typically surrounded by public  
physical space such as landings, foyers, and lobbies.  
Conveying equipment also permits large plan areas to be folded  
upon themselves so that the shortest distance between two points  
is not a straight line from one area of a floor to another area of the  
same floor, but rather a mechanized path between adjacent or  
widely dispersed floor levels. In very large facilities such as airport  
terminals and high-rise buildings, conveying equipment facilitates  
rapid and easy communication between widely separated points  
that might otherwise be impractical to traverse, such as the  
sequence of passenger dropoff, baggage conveying, ticketing, pas-  
senger loading bridges, and departure lobbies.  
• Hydraulic elevators\: Use a hydraulic oil-driven machine to raise  
and lower the elevator car and its load. Lower speeds and piston  
length restrict the use of this type. Travel distances vary  
Elevators are generally used for longer-distance trips, while esca-  
lator trips are normally limited to five or fewer adjoining floor  
levels. Sky lobbies can be used to divide buildings into vertical  
sub-buildings, and smaller elevators, escalators, stairs, or any  
combination can provide circulation among the divisions.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Careful and expert consideration is required in the strategic design  
and automated operation of conveying equipment; therefore  
appropriate consultants should be engaged early in the design  
process.  
Conveying equipment interfaces directly with the general circula-  
tion system and planning organization of a facility. Mechanized  
passenger pathways should be supplemented by modes of emer-  
gency egress. To the extent that vertical conveyance equipment  
permits high-rise building designs, the same equipment may also  
impact site planning and building utilization. High-volume circula-  
tion situations may require close coordination between various  
elements of conveying systems \(such as between passenger eleva-  
tors, service elevators, and escalators\).  
13.1 These dimensions are general guidelines for selecting an elevator,  
using height as a criterion.

between 35 and 60 ft. dependent upon configuration and capac-  
ity. Although generally requiring the least initial installation  
expense, this elevator type requires more power to operate and  
will cost more over the lifecycle.  
• Electric traction elevators\: Elevators in which the energy is  
applied by means of an electric motor. Medium to high speeds  
and virtually limitless rise allow this elevator type to serve high-  
rise, medium-rise, and low-rise buildings. Electric traction eleva-  
tors can be further divided into geared and gearless categories.  
• Geared traction elevators\: Designed to operate within the  
general range of 100 to 450 ft./min, restricting their use to  
medium-rise buildings.  
• Gearless traction elevators\: Available in units with speeds of  
500 to 1200 ft./min. They offer the advantages of a long life  
and a smooth ride.

• Passenger elevators\: Used to convey people from floor to floor.  
Elevator cars are available in standard and custom designs.  
• Service elevators\: In industrial, residential, and commercial  
buildings, service elevators are often standard passenger eleva-  
tor packages modified for service use.  
• Freight elevators\: Usually classed as general freight, motor  
vehicle, industrial truck, or concentrated loading elevators.  
General freight loading elevators may be electric drum type or  
traction or hydraulic elevators.

serve a single unit in a building with multiple dwelling units. By  
code, elevators in private residences are limited in size, capacity,  
rise, and speed.  
sections of a building. This may result in the designation of eleva-  
tors as either local or express elevators. Local elevators serve a  
designated group of floors within a building, stopping at every floor.  
Express elevators typically transport passengers between specific  
floors, bypassing the intermediate floors.  
Additional factors that impact traffic design include travel distance,  
operating speed, and the number of stops assigned to each elevator.  
The traffic analysis of elevators required for a large or complex build-  
ing should always be performed by a qualified elevator consultant.  
Passenger elevators should be centrally located, near the main entrance, and easily accessible on all floors. Groups of elevators should  
be arranged to minimize walking distance between cars. Lobby space must be sufficient to accommodate group movement. In general,  
elevators may not open into a corridor. The largest practical grouping of elevators in a building is eight cars. One row of more than four  
cars is generally not recommended. With groupings of four or six cars, lobbies may be closed at one end, forming an alcove, or open at  
both ends. In buildings with several elevator groupings, one group may serve lower floors, while others serve as express elevators to  
upper floors. When four or more elevators serve all or the same part of a building, they must be located in a minimum of two hoistways,  
but no more than four elevators can be located in any one hoistway. The use of elevators with front and rear openings may provide an  
option for building service applications.  
Physical building characteristics such as building height and hoist-  
way location are considered in conjunction with population charac-  
teristics to determine the size, capacity, speed, type, and location  
of elevator components. These characteristics in particular affect  
elevator design\:  
• Height\: The distance of elevator travel from lowest stop to  
uppermost stop, the total number of stops, and the distance  
between stops.  
• Building use\: The location of heavily used entrance areas, such  
as those leading to cafeterias, restaurants, auditoriums, and  
service areas. Typically, plan a facility so that no prospective  
passenger must walk more than 200 ft. to reach an elevator.  
The elevator selection process begins with a thorough analysis of  
how people will occupy the facility. Four issues are pertinent\:  
• Total population and density\: Determine these figures for each  
floor or for a portion of floors.  
• Peak loading\: Identify the periods when elevators will carry the  
highest traffic loads.  
• Waiting time\: This is the length of time a passenger is expected  
to wait for the next elevator to arrive.  
• Demand for quality\: Smooth operation may be as important as  
fancy finishes.

Elevator traffic is typically defined in terms of critical or “peak”  
periods of elevator usage during a typical day. Traffic is thus dis-  
cussed in terms of up-peak and down-peak, which refer to the  
direction of high traffic demands. While they are traditionally used  
to refer to the start and end of a business day \(up-peak in the  
morning and down-peak in the early evening\), they may also extend  
to lunch hour traffic \(if all employees have the same designated  
lunch hour\) or may be impacted by flexible work hours where  
employees set their own work schedules.  
Another key factor is passenger “wait time.” This is the length of  
time a passenger waits for an elevator to arrive after they have  
pushed the call button. In a building with good elevator service the  
average wait time is less than 30 seconds.  
Some settings require the separation of elevators into distinct  
banks \(groups of two or more elevators\) that serve specific

In buildings without full automatic fire sprinkler systems, areas of  
refuge are required at a designated elevator \(provided with emer-  
gency power\) and at fire stairs—above the ground floor. The area  
of refuge concept may also apply to egress from the ground floor  
of a building where and when accessible egress is a challenge due  
to terrain, traffic, or snow and ice. A building that is fully sprin-  
klered does not need to have structural areas of refuge—but will  
have identified assistance-waiting areas. Signage and communica-  
tion requirements for areas of refuge are specified in the applica-  
ble codes.  
Facility type and size will dramatically affect the selection of an  
appropriate elevator system and components. An owner’s require-  
ments for service \(along with budget constraints\) will influence the  
design process. The mix of these considerations makes generalizing  
about elevators difficult. Hospitals can be particularly challenging as  
visitors, staff, patients on gurneys, and portable equipment vie for  
rapid access to other floors. Courthouses face population separa-  
tion issues. Requirements for freight \(service\) transport capabilities  
vary from building to building. High-rise building elevator systems  
are normally zoned to allow for acceptable performance. Elevators  
can be teamed with escalators to increase vertical access capacity.  
Some general patterns regarding elevator system sizing are pro-  
vided in Figure 13.6.  
For passenger service in a multistory building, the elevator system  
acts as a common flow path for the majority of occupants and visi-  
tors. It is important that the performance and ambience of this path  
match the context of the building. Several design criteria interact to  
determine elevator system performance—and thus user percep-  
tions of the system’s adequacy. Appropriate values for each criteri-  
on should be set by the design team—and will, along with car  
capacity, car speed, zoning, the number and location of main lobbies,  
and system control logic, determine elevator system requirements.  
Handling capacity is the percentage of the building population that  
can be handled by the elevator system in a defined time period  
\(normally 5 minutes\); if actual handling capacity is too low, waiting  
times will increase along with user dissatisfaction. Typical design  
targets for handling capacity are shown in Figure 13.7.  
Lobby waiting time is the average amount of time a passenger  
spends between arriving in the lobby \(and pushing a call button\)  
and leaving the floor in an elevator car; this is a direct indicator of  
elevator system performance in the eyes of users; long waiting  
times cause irritation. Typical design targets for waiting time are  
presented in Figure 13.8.

Average trip time is the average amount of time a passenger  
spends between pushing a lobby call button and departing the car  
at an upper floor; this is also perceived by users as an indicator of  
elevator system quality. In a commercial building, a trip time of less  
than 60 seconds is desirable; 75 seconds is bearable; 120 seconds  
is not acceptable. In residential buildings, longer trip times may be  
tolerated \(depending upon context\).

Electric traction elevators may be either geared or gearless sys-  
tems. The main differences between the two systems lie in travel  
speed and travel height. General design considerations involving  
hoistway, machine room, and elevator planning are similar.  
Both geared and gearless drive units are governed by electronic  
controls, which coordinate car leveling, passenger calls, collective  
operation of elevators, door operation, car acceleration and decel-  
eration, and safety applications. A broad range of control systems  
is available to meet individual facility requirements.  
Structural requirements call for the total weight of the elevator to  
be supported by the machine beams and transmitted to the build-  
ing \(or hoistway\) structure. Coordination with elevator consultants  
and structural engineers is important for proper design.  
Keep the following in mind when designing for traction elevators\:  
• Pit depths, clear overhead dimension, and machine room pent-  
house sizes should be in accordance with American Society of  
Mechanical Engineers Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators  
\(ASME A17.1\). Local codes may vary from these requirements  
along with requiring fire-resistance-rated enclosures.  
• Minimum clear overhead dimensions are based on manufacturer  
standard car heights.  
• Capacity may be expressed in passengers or pounds, depending  
upon what will be moved.  
• Elevator configuration will be dependent upon capacity and also  
entrance size and location.  
• Travel distance, speed, and number of stops will affect the  
design of the elevator and associated equipment.  
• The machine room for traction elevators is usually located  
directly above the hoistway in a penthouse, but may be located  
in other spaces adjacent to the hoistway. Space must be pro-  
vided for the elevator drive, electronic control equipment, and  
governor; provide sufficient clearance for equipment installa-  
tion, repair, and removal. Adequate lighting, heating, ventilation,  
and sound control should be provided. An elevator consultant  
can be a valuable asset to the design team during the early  
phases of a project.

Hydraulic elevators are used primarily in low- and mid-rise instal-  
lations, where moderate car speed \(up to 150 ft. per minute\) is  
acceptable. A car is connected to the top of a piston that moves up  
and down in a cylinder. The car moves up when hydraulic fluid is  
pumped into the cylinder from a reservoir, raising the piston. The  
car is lowered when the hydraulic fluid returns to the reservoir.  
13.10 Side-mounted counterweights allow an optional rear entrance  
door.

The up and down motions of the elevator car are controlled by the  
hydraulic valve.  
The main space planning elements of a hydraulic elevator are the  
machine room, usually located at the base, and the hoistway, which  
serves as a fire-protected, ventilated passageway for the elevator  
car. Adequate structure must be provided at the base of the hoist-  
way to bear the load of the elevator car and its supporting piston  
or cylinder.  
There are three configurations of hydraulic elevators\: holed, hole-  
less, and roped hydraulic. The cylinder in a holed hydraulic elevator  
is centered below the car and bored into the earth. The cylinder  
depth will be approximately equal to the travel distance plus the pit  
depth. Holeless hydraulic elevator cylinders are located on one or  
both sides of the car and do not penetrate below the elevator pit.  
Holeless hydraulic elevators have substantially less travel than  
holed types. With roped hydraulic elevators, a plunger moves the  
cables or ropes, which then moves the elevator car. All three con-  
figurations can be used in commercial applications, but holed and  
holeless are the most common types.  
When designing for hydraulic elevators, follow these guidelines\:  
• Ensure that pit depths and overhead clearances are in accor-  
dance with ASME A17.1 requirements; note that local codes may  
vary from these requirements.  
• Use car and hoistway dimensions of units for reference pur-  
poses only. A variety of units are available. Consult with manu-  
facturers for specific dimensions.  
• Hoistway walls serve primarily as fire-resistant enclosures.  
Check local codes to determine required fire-resistance ratings.  
• Guide rails extend from the floor of the pit to the top of the  
hoistway to guide the car inside the hoistway.  
• Rail brackets attach the guide rails to the hoistway walls and  
typically are located at each floor level. A bracket is required at  
the top of the hoistway, and an intermediate bracket may be  
required for excessive floor-to-floor heights.  
• Holed hydraulic applications require a jack hole in the floor of  
the pit.

Passenger elevators are primarily intended to transport people  
from floor to floor in multistory buildings. A passenger elevator  
system consists of one or more elevator cars arranged to meet  
building needs. Elevator cars are rated by loading capacity  
\(expressed in pounds\) and by system speed. Cars intended for pas-  
senger use are normally outfitted with amenities \(interior finishes  
and lighting\) appropriate to the building context. Passenger eleva-  
tors can also be used to move light freight \(within the limits of the  
car’s loading capacity\) and may be provided with removable pads  
to protect wall surfaces when used for other than incidental freight.  
There are three common types of passenger elevators\: traction—  
gearless, typically used in high-rise applications; traction—geared,  
used in mid- to high-rise residential buildings and mid-rise com-  
mercial; and hydraulic, limited to low-rise to mid-rise applications.  
Traction elevator speeds can vary to suit the project needs and may  
be quite high. Hydraulic elevator speeds are lower.  
Passenger elevator car layout, access, and exterior control ele-  
ments will comply with the accessibility requirements of the ADA.  
In multistory buildings, one or more cars may need to be arranged  
to provide accessible emergency egress.  
General freight elevators with capacities of 2000 to 8000 lb. satisfy  
a variety of material-handling requirements. Industrial truck  
freight elevators require special design considerations to handle  
truckloads of 10,000 to 20,000 lb. or more.  
General freight or industrial truck elevators may have either  
hydraulic or traction drive systems, similar to those of other eleva-  
tors. The units are, however, usually custom-designed with vertical  
bipart doors and special structural support to accommodate heavy  
loads and eccentric loading conditions. Freight elevators usually  
have simple control systems and operate at slower speeds than  
other elevators. Their capacity must be sized for the largest  
expected load.  
• Hydraulic elevators\: Use a hydraulic oil–driven machine to raise  
and lower the elevator car and its load. Lower speeds and piston  
length restrict the use of this type. Travel distances vary  
between 35 and 60 ft. dependent upon configuration and capac-  
ity. Although generally requiring the least initial installation  
expense, this elevator type requires more power to operate and  
will cost more over the lifecycle.  
• Electric traction elevators\: Elevators in which the energy is  
applied by means of an electric motor. Medium to high speeds  
and virtually limitless rise allow this elevator type to serve high-  
rise, medium-rise, and low-rise buildings. Electric traction eleva-  
tors can be further divided into geared and gearless categories.  
• Geared traction elevators\: Designed to operate within the  
general range of 100 to 450 ft./min, restricting their use to  
medium-rise buildings.  
• Gearless traction elevators\: Available in units with speeds of  
500 to 1200 ft./min. They offer the advantages of a long life  
and a smooth ride.  
• Passenger elevators\: Used to convey people from floor to floor.  
Elevator cars are available in standard and custom designs.  
• Service elevators\: In industrial, residential, and commercial  
buildings, service elevators are often standard passenger eleva-  
tor packages modified for service use.  
• Freight elevators\: Usually classed as general freight, motor  
vehicle, industrial truck, or concentrated loading elevators.  
General freight loading elevators may be electric drum type or  
traction or hydraulic elevators.  
• Residential elevators\: Installed only in a private residence or to  
serve a single unit in a building with multiple dwelling units. By  
code, elevators in private residences are limited in size, capacity,  
rise, and speed.

flush valves\) is also a design consideration in buildings. Other  
design issues that must be considered include coordination of  
plumbing fixture location with toilet compartments and urinal  
screens, toilet and bath accessories, and tub and shower doors.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
A plumbing system is used to safely transfer liquids and gases to  
and from a building and its site. Water supply, plumbing fixtures,  
and waste piping may be the most common type of plumbing sys-  
tem within a building. However, other types of plumbing systems  
may be required, including plumbing for gas service, and, depend-  
ing on the facility type, services such as medical gases in a hospital.  
Plumbing design usually will affect the overall design of a facility.  
Determining the fixture count, space requirements, and location of  
toilet rooms within the building should be an early planning consid-  
eration of the design team. When sustainable design is a concern,  
addressing rainwater and site drainage issues should also be part  
of the early planning process. Existing utility conditions and infra-  
structure \(storm drainage, water utilities, and sanitary sewage  
utilities\) need to be considered. These utilities may need to be  
addressed on a site, facility, or campus basis, or at a municipal  
scale when services do not exist. Spacing and location of plumbing  
fixtures and toilet rooms should respond to occupant needs and  
code requirements. The design professional should be aware of  
how water is piped to plumbing fixtures, how waste is plumbed  
from fixtures, along with general venting requirements. Even dur-  
ing preliminary design, the design team should begin to address  
the requirements for accumulation and flow of waste through  
horizontal and vertical piping.  
Other issues that should be considered in the design of the facility  
plumbing system include the control of noise, vibration, and piping  
condensation.  
• Noise is a factor of high-velocity liquid flow in pipes or of fixture  
noise \(such as flush valves\).  
• Vibration is the result of mechanically coupling pipes to moving  
equipment \(such as pumps\), as well as the manner in which  
piping is physically isolated from the building structure.  
Structure-borne noise can propagate very efficiently.  
• Condensation occurs when exposed or insufficiently insulated  
pipes cooled by their contents pass through warm, moist air and  
the exterior of the pipe reaches the dew point temperature.  
The potential flow of unhealthy and dangerous sewer gases back  
into the building requires the use of water-filled traps at each fix-  
ture, as well as a system of venting to open air. Exterior openings of  
these vents should be placed away from direct view, and must be  
remote from any outdoor air intakes to the building. Additionally,  
there are code requirements for the location in relationship to roofs.  
Plumbing fixtures provide the most visible design elements in this  
system; they are the parts of the building that occupants actually  
touch and feel. Most other plumbing components are concealed  
within the building construction.  
The basic components of a plumbing installation \(water distribution  
and sanitary waste drainage system\) are as follows\:  
1\. Service tap  
2\. Meter  
3\. Shutoff valve  
4\. Service entry  
5\. Fixture supply tree  
6\. Fixture  
7\. Trap  
8\. Drain  
9\. Venting  
10\. Waste piping  
11\. Cleanouts  
12\. Building trap  
13\. Sewer connection  
Plumbing codes establish minimum acceptable standards for the  
design and installation of plumbing systems and selection of the  
components they comprise. Model building codes and the plumbing  
codes associated with them have found general acceptance in  
large areas of the country. However, some jurisdictions have  
adopted their own codes or modifications of one or more of the  
model codes. Verify the plumbing code used by the authority having  
jurisdiction and any amendments for each specific project.  
Requirements for plumbing system design should be based on the  
adopted code\(s\) used by the jurisdiction of the project. Tables and  
charts provided in this chapter are for preliminary planning pur-  
poses and should not be used for actual design.  
The word “approved” is often used in conjunction with components  
and devices that come in contact with potable water and products  
used for human consumption or use. Nonetheless, a responsible  
code official or agency must examine and test these items to  
determine whether they are suitable for a particular intended use.  
Only materials and devices approved by the local jurisdiction can  
be used in plumbing systems. Plumbing design drawings and utility  
services also must be examined and found to be in compliance with  
local codes, rules, and regulations.  
The U.S. Department of Justice has developed, in the ADAAG  
\(Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines\), wide-  
ranging and detailed technical requirements for accessibility in new  
construction and renovations. Since then, ANSI A117.1 has been  
adopted into building codes. ANSI A117.1 provides specific dimen-  
sioned layouts for various design features \(such as wheelchair  
turning space and clearances\) for plumbing fixtures \(including water  
closets, bathtubs, shower enclosures, and drinking fountains\).  
Water conservation may be accomplished by selecting fixtures that  
use less water than conventional \(code-minimum\) fixtures. These  
include\:  
• Reduced-flow water closets  
• Flow-restricting shower heads  
• Aerating faucets  
• Water-conserving dishwashers  
• Water-conserving clothes washers  
Water conservation may also be accomplished by fixtures that use  
less water per operation/cycle than conventional \(code-minimum\)  
fixtures. These include\:  
• Multicycle dishwashers  
• Multicycle clothes washers  
In addition, water conservation may be accomplished by fixtures  
that use no water or an alternative source of water. These include\:  
• Waterless urinals  
• Composting toilets  
• Graywater supplies  
• Rainwater cistern supplies  
Water conservation may also be accomplished by modifying human  
behavior \(usage patterns\). The most common examples of this are  
municipal water-use restrictions on hose bibb use and parental  
supervision of teenager shower lengths.  
Materials conservation\: This is an area that is not being formally  
pursued in most green building rating systems. Building code  
requirements for hygienic and healthful materials tend to restrict  
recycled content potentials for fixtures. Local sourcing of fixtures,  
piping, and accessories should be considered \(when possible\) to  
reduce energy and pollution associated with transportation of  
system components.  
Energy conservation\: There are two main sides to conserving  
energy in plumbing systems operation. The first is to reduce the  
use of potable water, which consumes energy in its processing and  
delivery and again in its treatment at a sewage plant. The second  
is to reduce the energy required for water heating. This may be  
accomplished by\:  
• Using water-conserving fixtures that use less water  
• Reducing hot water temperatures \(within the limits set by  
codes\)  
• Using more energy-efficient heating systems \(high-efficiency  
combustion and/or instantaneous heaters\)  
• Using solar thermal water heaters \(shifting from fossil fuels to  
renewable energy\)  
Sustainability from an equity perspective may be addressed by ensur-  
ing that designs allow for equal outcomes across the genders—as  
opposed to simply providing equivalent fixture counts. This has been  
referred to as “potty parity.”  
Plumbing and piping connect to a building structure and may  
require vibration isolation to avoid structure-borne noise transmis-  
sion. Acoustic considerations are necessary when routing of  
plumbing or piping near occupied spaces. Fixture noise \(such as  
Physical sustainability concerns \(as distinct from economic and  
equity considerations\) related to plumbing system design will nor-  
mally focus on three areas\: \(1\) water conservation, \(2\) conserva-  
tion of material resources, and \(3\) energy efficiency.  
Plumbing systems design is heavily dictated by code requirements  
that have evolved over time to protect the health, safety, and wel-  
fare of building users and the public. Although plumbing codes are  
beginning to consider water conservation as a social benefit to be  
encouraged \(similar to energy codes\), they provide a lowest com-  
mon denominator for sustainability. Designers will need to reach  
beyond code to engage sustainability.  
The fundamental building block of a plumbing system is the fixture.  
A fixture is a device that requires water or produces sanitary drain-  
age. Most fixtures do both. Common fixtures include\: lavatories  
\(bathroom sinks\) with faucets, bathtubs with faucets, showers with  
faucets, water closets \(toilets\) with flush mechanism, service  
sinks, drinking fountains, hose bibbs \(exterior faucets\), washing  
machines, dishwashers, and often refrigerators.  
Water conservation\: Design guidance regarding water conserva-  
tion is fairly well developed. Prevalent thinking about the potential  
to conserve water is embodied in any of several well-known green  
building evaluation and rating systems. Minimum expectations for  
a green plumbing system are typically expressed in rating systems  
via prerequisites. Higher aspirations for greenness are engaged  
via optional credits. A desire for sustainability will surpass such  
green building credits—perhaps embracing net-zero water use.  
A building service is that portion of the supply piping on private  
property that extends below frost depth from the public utility main  
into the building. It includes the connection to the main, valves,  
pressure-reducing devices, backflow prevention devices, meters,  
and other requirements specific to the individual utility company.  
Because of different requirements the water supply service for  
commercial buildings is often divided into two separate services at  
the public main\: potable water and fire protection water. However,  
a single, combined service is sometimes used.  
It is extremely important for a utility company to protect the public  
water supply from contamination flowing from any building to  
which it is supplying water. The device used to accomplish this is

the backflow preventer \(BFP\), which prevents contaminated water  
from flowing backward into the potable water supply.  
There are four types of BFP, and the degree of hazard in a particu-  
lar situation determines which type to select and install\:  
• Air gap\: This BFP provides a physical separation between the  
supply of potable water and the storage tank or piping distribu-  
tion network. This is a passive method and is considered the only  
absolutely safe concept.  
• Reduced-pressure zone \(RPZ\)\: This type of BFP is a mechanical  
device used when a high hazard is present. Liquids attempting to  
flow in reverse discharge out of the BFP instead. When installed  
in a building water supply, the RPZ backflow preventer should be  
located as close to the public water main as is practical.  
• Double check valve\: This is a mechanical device often used on  
fire protection water supplies and for smaller-size piping that  
supplies equipment that has a back pressure and is not consid-  
ered a high hazard.  
• Vacuum breaker\: This mechanical device is used when there is  
no back pressure, such as for a submerged water supply to a  
water closet. It uses a flexible diaphragm that allows water to  
flow through in only one direction; it closes on itself, stopping  
flow in the reverse direction.  
After connecting a plumbing system to the public water main, it is  
necessary to provide a method to shut off the water supply to the  
building without entering it. A curb valve installed close to the  
property line is used to serve this function. A second shutoff valve  
is provided inside the building at the service entrance.  
For high hazard occupancies, a reduced-pressure zone BFP should  
be installed as close to the public main as is reasonable to protect  
the public water supply from contamination. Because of the poten-  
tially large discharge of water, an aboveground, heated enclosure  
is recommended. For less hazardous locations, a double check  
valve assembly may be permitted. No water is discharged from a  
double check valve.  
Water meters are necessary to measure the amount of water used  
in a facility. The arrangement of the water meter assembly is spe-  
cific to each utility. The meter could be located in an outside pit or  
exposed inside the building. The meter used should be selected  
for accuracy. A compound meter, consisting of separate sections for  
low and high flows, is often used for applications such as multiple  
dwellings and dormitories.  
A strainer may be required before the meter, if solids are present  
in the water supply. A second backflow preventer may be required  
on individual water branches supplying specific equipment inside a  
building.  
• A hot water system heats raw water from ambient temperature  
to a desired higher temperature and delivers the heated water  
to all plumbing fixtures and equipment requiring hot water. The  
recommended hot water temperature at the heater is 140°F. A  
booster hot water system can be used to heat primary service  
hot water to a higher temperature for a specific purpose.  
• A hot water recirculation system ensures hot water is quickly  
available to plumbing fixtures. Generally accepted practice  
requires that hot water delivered to terminal points of the sys-  
tem reach utilization temperature in 20 seconds or less. Some  
codes also require a form of temperature maintenance if the  
distance of a fixture from the heater exceeds a set distance  
\(often, 50 ft.\).  
A potable water system delivers water suitable for human con-  
sumption at appropriate pressure and volume to all plumbing fix-  
tures and equipment. Three types of systems and their appropriate  
uses include the following\:  
• A street pressure system is suitable when the water pressure  
supplied from a public water main is sufficient to supply all fix-  
tures and equipment in a building without the use of a booster  
pump. This generally requires that the static pressure in the  
public main be no less than 50 lb. per square inch \(psi\).  
• Estimating maximum water demand\: Maximum instantaneous  
water demand is estimated using water supply fixture units  
\(WFU\) converted to gallons per minute \(gpm\). The supply  
demand curve converts WFU to gpm using “Hunters Curve,”  
which is derived from a statistical method of estimating how  
often various fixtures would be used simultaneously. The conver-  
sion of WFUs is separated into two categories, one for flush  
valves and one for flush tanks. Since the flush valve has a much  
higher flow rate, its conversion from WFUs shows a larger flow  
rate of water.  
• Water velocity\: Generally accepted practice limits the velocity of  
water in piping to 8 ft. per second \(fps\) to avoid excessive noise  
and prevent erosion of the piping. The velocity should be

lowered to 4 fps to avoid corrosion when softened water is used  
and to avoid water hammer when any quick-closing valves are  
installed. All branches containing a flush valve or quick-closing  
valve should have shock absorbers installed downstream of the  
last fixture.  
• Factors affecting design of a public water main\: It is necessary  
to obtain the location, elevation, and size of the water main from  
the local water purveyor. Also helpful is a topographical map  
showing the relative ground elevations and any obstructions  
\(trees, boulders, curbs, etc.\) that would interfere with the run  
from the main into the building. If possible, find out the frost  
depth for the project site. When this information is unavailable,  
generally a dimension of 5 ft.-0 in. to the centerline is consid-  
ered a safe figure for depth of bury.  
• Static and residual water pressure\: The actual water pressure in  
the water main is critical to the design of the water supply sys-  
tem. The static pressure is the water pressure in the main when  
no water is flowing in an immediate connection adjacent to the  
project site. The residual pressure is the water pressure avail-  
able in the main when a considerable amount of water is flowing  
from any connection \(usually a fire hydrant\) close to where the  
building water supply will be connected to the public main. This  
information is obtained by means of a flow test, often called a  
hydrant flow test . The residual \(lower\) pressure is used to size  
the project water supply distribution network.  
• Minimum fixture operating pressure\: Various plumbing fixtures  
and devices require a minimum pressure to ensure proper  
operation. Generally accepted values are given in Figure 13.22,  
but should be verified by the fixture or equipment manufacturer.  
A booster pump is utilized when there is insufficient pressure from  
the water. A control system senses variations in the distribution  
system and adjusts either the speed of the pump or a flow regula-  
tor to maintain constant pressure of acceptable value.  
Two types of booster pump controls are available for adjusting  
pressure and flow in the water distribution system\:  
• Constant speed  
• Constant pressure

In an elevated water tank system, water is pumped from the level  
where the building water service enters the building up to an ele-  
vated water storage tank, commonly called a gravity tank or a  
house tank. The pump most often used is the centrifugal pump , and  
it is commonly called a house pump when used for this service.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Water pressure in a building may be increased by means of these  
pressure-boosting systems\:  
• Booster pumps  
• Elevated water tanks  
• Hydropneumatic tanks  
A combination of two such systems, called a hybrid system, may be  
used when a single type is impractical or not economical.  
The pump most often used for water service is the baseplate-  
mounted centrifugal pump. This type of pump should be directly  
installed on an equipment pad with proper grouting or with vibra-  
tion isolation devices separating the pump base and the building  
structure. This arrangement helps prevent noise caused by the  
transfer of vibration from the pump to the building structure.  
Vibration isolation devices installed between the pump suction and  
discharge connections and the distribution piping will prevent  
transfer of vibration to the connected piping.  
The house tank is located above the highest and most hydraulically  
remote point in a building water supply system. The height of the  
tank provides additional static head, increasing the pressure in the  
water distribution system.  
The advantages of the elevated water tank system are as follows\:  
• It is less complex than either of the other two systems.  
• Fewer components are required to control and operate the  
system.  
• It is more efficient and costs less to operate than the other  
systems.  
• It may use a smaller pump.  
• Pressure fluctuations in the system are small.  
• Maintenance requirements are minimal.  
Disadvantages of the elevated water tank system are\:  
• An exposed tank, or the enclosure around it, may be considered  
unsightly.  
• The building structure may require reinforcement to support the  
additional weight.  
• Tank and piping may be subject to freezing if exposed.  
• Water pressure on the upper floors may be inadequate for some  
fixtures.  
• A catastrophic tank failure could flood the roof.  
The capacity of the house tank depends on the type of facility it will  
serve. To determine an approximate size for the domestic storage  
volume for a multiple-dwelling gravity tank\:  
• Determine the number of people the system will serve. If this  
figure is not available, estimate by counting two people per  
bedroom or four people per apartment, whichever is larger.  
• Multiply the number of people by the gallons required per per-  
son to find the total domestic storage capacity. Add to this figure  
constant uses of water \(such as HVAC makeup and fire protec-  
tion water storage, if any\).  
• Finally, select a standard storage tank size equal to or larger  
than the required amount of stored water.  
The capacity of the house pump\(s\) is determined by the quantity of  
water stored for domestic use. In general, a house pump should be  
capable of replacing the domestic reserve in about one-half to two  
hours; one hour is a generally accepted value. A duplex pump  
arrangement \(two pumps in parallel\), with each pump full size,  
should be provided so the system is not impaired if one pump is out  
of service.

A common problem with the gravity tank system is the lack of  
adequate water pressure on the upper floors of a building unless  
the tank is elevated to an impractical height. Under these condi-  
tions, a hybrid system composed of an elevated tank plus a small  
booster pump or small hydropneumatic system, used only for the  
top several floors, is suitable.

Sanitary waste systems convey waterborne effluent from plumbing  
fixtures and other equipment to an approved point of disposal that  
discharges into a facility sanitary sewer. The sanitary sewer system  
receives all liquid waste \(sanitary waste\), except stormwater or  
unacceptably treated process or chemical waste. Effluent that  
contains bodily waste is referred to as soil . Clear water waste, such  
as that from equipment, sinks, or showers, is referred to as waste .  
Untreated waste containing chemical effluent must be treated  
before discharge into the sewer system or the environment.  
Treatment can be carried out either by a public utility or on-site with  
a private treatment plant approved by the local jurisdiction.  
The building drain is the lowest portion of the drainage system  
inside a building; it is the main line that carries effluent outside the  
building. The building sewer is a continuation of the building trap  
that runs from outside the building to the point of disposal. A stack  
is a vertical pipe more than three stories high. A branch line is any  
drainage line connecting to a stack or the building drain.  
A number of design requirements apply.  
• Plumbing codes require that any substance harmful to the build-  
ing drainage system, the public sewer, or the municipal sewage  
treatment process be prevented from entering the public sewer  
system by the installation of an approved sanitary waste inter-  
ceptor. Such materials include grease, flammable liquids, sand, or  
other substances local authorities determine are objectionable.  
• Where public sewers are available, connect the building sewer  
to the public sewer. Plugged outlets, called laterals, are often  
provided for future connections to the public sewer. If no later-  
als are available, a direct connection is made.  
• In the absence of public sewers, a private sewage disposal  
system must be provided. The most commonly used is a facility  
septic tank, which depends on bacterial action to change most  
solids into a liquid, which is then discharged into an under-  
ground absorption field. The basic principle is to have the volume  
of effluent conditioned by the septic tank and the discharge from  
the tank absorbed into the ground as quickly as it is discharged.  
Laundry appliances should be routed to separate drywells since  
the soap and other chemicals retard or stop bacterial action in  
a septic tank. Grease should be disposed of separately. The  
design, selection, and location of septic tank components are  
strictly governed by local codes, requirements of which vary  
widely.

The sizing of drainage and waste lines from fixtures is based on  
total DFUs, the pitch of the drainage pipe, and the classification of  
the line as a branch, stack, or building drain.  
The fixture schedule shows the minimum-size line permitted from  
a fixture. At each design point, add all DFUs together. Utilize  
Table 13.31, based on line classification and the pitch of the pipe,  
and find a figure equal to or greater than the DFUs calculated.  
Read horizontally to find the pipe size.  
The minimum pitch for branches 3 in. and smaller is 1/4 in./ft. For  
lines 4 in. and larger, it is 1/8 in./ft. A branch interval is the rough  
equivalent of one floor level. The minimum pitch for building drains  
\(main lines inside the building\) and building sewers \(main lines out-  
side the building that connect with the public sewer\) is 1/16 in./ft.

In the absence of specific code requirements, use the following as  
a guide for locating vent extensions\:  
• Do not locate the vent extension under or within 10 ft. of any  
window, door, or ventilating opening, unless it is 2 ft. above that  
opening.  
• If the terminal is through a building wall, locate it a minimum of  
10 ft. from the property line, a minimum of 10 ft. above grade,  
and not under any overhang.

A fixture trap is a U-shaped section of pipe deep enough to prevent  
the passage of sewer gas into a fixture. Traps must be self-clean-  
ing, provide a liquid seal of at least 2 in. \(larger when required\),  
conform to local code requirements regarding minimum size, must  
have an accessible cleanout, and are capable of draining a fixture  
rapidly. All traps must be vented, unless waived by local codes. All  
fixtures directly connected to the sanitary drainage system must  
be trapped and vented.  
A vent equalizes the pneumatic pressures \(both positive and nega-  
tive\) within a facility sanitary sewage system. The purpose of a  
vent system is to limit the pneumatic pressure to plus or minus  
1 in. of water column. Vent systems terminate in the outside air  
and connect indirectly to every fixture trap.  
Vent lines are sized using three factors\:  
• Drainage fixture units  
• Size of the drainage line \(or stack\) to which the fixtures are  
connected  
• Developed length of the vent line from the fixture to the vent  
stack  
Applicable design requirements are\:  
• The size of a vent stack should be a minimum of one-half the size  
of a soil or waste line. The size of a branch vent should be a  
minimum of one-half the size of the branch drainage line it  
serves.  
• Each individual fixture vent must rise above the flood level of the  
fixture served before it is connected to another vent line, so as  
not to act as a waste line in the event the drain line becomes  
blocked.  
• To size a vent stack, use the drainage fixture unit \(DFU\) load for  
the entire drainage stack and the full, developed length of the  
vent from the lowest connection up to the roof. Vent stacks must  
be undiminished in size for the entire length.  
• For branch vents, use the longest developed length, from the  
point where the size is being determined to the farthest connec-  
tion to a branch drainage line.  
• Building traps, where installed, should have a vent called a fresh  
air inlet . The inlet should be one-half the size of the building  
drain, with a minimum size of 4 in.  
• Vent pipes that pass through a roof must remain open under all  
circumstances. The two most common causes of blockage in  
exposed pipes are frost closure and snow closure. Local codes and  
authorities will provide the minimum height needed to avoid clo-  
sure by accumulated snow on a roof. This dimension is often 2 ft.

A floor drain removes liquids from interior, normally occupied  
areas of a building and discharges them into either the sanitary or  
an industrial waste drainage system. A commonly cited standard  
for floor drains is ANSI A112.21.  
Hot water usage and flow rates are characterized by intermittent  
periods of peak, sustained, and low-to-zero flows. The pattern of  
usage varies widely, depending on the building type and use, time of  
day, time of year, population, and connected equipment and fixtures.

There are three primary types of water heaters\: automatic storage  
heaters, instantaneous demand water heaters, and combination  
water heaters, the most common of which is the automatic storage  
heater.  
Warm and moist environments will support the growth of bacteria  
and in some cases disease has been traced to domestic hot water  
distribution systems. It is highly recommended that water for  
domestic purposes be heated initially to a temperature of 140°F  
and lowered to the final temperature with a mixing valve. The final  
temperature of the water should be high enough to meet the mini-  
mum requirements of the connected equipment.

Storage-type heaters are sized using the total volume of hot water  
required for the estimated duration of maximum demand. This total  
volume can be provided by any combination of hot water storage  
capacity and water heater recovery \(makeup\) rate. The required  
storage and recovery values depend on the project type. The major  
advantage of using a storage-type water heater instead of an  
instantaneous demand water heater is that they use considerably  
less energy.  
Use Figure 13.40 to provide preliminary estimates for hot water  
demand on a project\:  
• Select the facility type.  
• Determine the number of each fixture type and find the hot  
water demand for each fixture using the figure.  
• Multiply the gallons-per-hour value for each fixture by the total  
number of individual fixtures.  
• Add together the resulting figure for all fixture types to deter-  
mine the total connected \(demand\) load for the building in gal-  
lons of water per hour.  
• Find the actual hourly demand for the facility by multiplying the  
total connected load by the demand factor shown at the bottom  
of Figure 13.40. This will yield the total volume of hot water to  
be used by the facility during a one-hour period.

water should be stored. The recommended volume for storage is a  
function of the actual hourly demand. The storage requirement is  
found by multiplying the total hourly demand by the storage capac-  
ity factor found at the bottom of Figure 13.40. This figure is the  
usable volume of hot water required to be stored.  
The recovery requirement and the storage requirement represent  
one hour’s peak use of hot water. There may be occasions when the  
duration is longer than one hour.  
Refer to Figure 13.41 to determine whether the facility should have  
more than a one-hour peak usage duration. If so, multiply the  
actual hourly demand by the number of hours of peak duration to  
find the total volume in gallons of hot water required for the entire  
peak period. Select a recovery rate and storage tank capacity  
combination to cover the total number of gallons. For example, if  
the actual hourly demand is 1000 gal/hr for a duration of three  
hours, the total volume of hot water required will be 3000 gallons.  
If the usable storage volume is 1000 gal, the recovery rate required  
for the three-hour period will be 2000 divided by 3, or 670 gal/hr.  
The total of 1000-gallon storage + 2010-gallon makeup \(670 GPH  
× 3\) will equal slightly more than the 3000 gallons required.

occurring or intentionally designed low area that collects water\).  
Sump pumps are installed when accumulation of water in a sump  
is unacceptable \(as in a building basement\) and gravity flow is not  
possible \(usually due to the elevation of the sump relative to  
drainage lines\). Sump pumps commonly operate intermittently \(as  
needed\) and discharge to the ground surface or to a code-  
acceptable drainage pipe.  
There are two primary types of sump pumps\: pedestal and sub-  
mersible. The difference between the two refers to the location of  
the pump motor—above the sump or in the sump—which affects  
appearance and service. Common components of a sump pump  
system include\: \(1\) a motor \(usually centrifugal and between 1/4  
and 1 hp in building applications\); \(2\) an impeller, which creates a  
low-pressure region at the intake and a higher-pressure region at  
the discharge; \(3\) a discharge pipe with check valve to lead water  
to its point of disposal; and \(4\) controls, often based upon a float  
switch that senses water level in the sump pit. Minimum recom-  
mended pump running time is one minute, for optimum reliability.  
To find the depth for sewage pump basin and pits, use the follow-  
ing approximate dimensions as a guide, assuming duplex pumps  
and starting from the invert of the inlet pipe.  
• From the invert of the inlet pipe, allow 6 in. to the high water  
alarm.  
• From the high water alarm, allow 6 in. to pump 2 start in a  
duplex installation.  
• From pump 2 start, allow 6 in. to pump 1 start.  
• Below pump 1 start, the dimension of the liquid capacity depends  
on a 1- to 5-minute operating period of the selected pump. The  
lower level of the storage portion is the pump stop. Figure  
13.153 gives the storage capacity of different-sized basins.  
• Allow 6 in. from pump stop to the inlet of the pump.  
• Allow 1 ft. to the basin bottom from the inlet of the pump. This  
dimension varies according to manufacturer.  
• Sewage and waste effluents have the same hydraulic character-  
istics as water. Ejector discharge lines should be a minimum of  
3 in., and sump discharge lines should be a minimum of 2 in., to  
prevent stoppages. The pump head is found by adding the dis-  
tance from the bottom of the basin to one foot higher than the  
point of discharge and the friction loss of water through the  
discharge pipe.  
• Duplex pumps generally require a minimum diameter of 4 ft.  
Common materials used in pipes are described in this section.  
Cast-iron \(CI\) pipe and fittings are manufactured in two weight  
classes\: standard and extra heavy. Each class is available either  
with hub and spigot ends \(ASTM A74\) or hubless \(CISPI 301 pipe  
and CISPI 310 fittings\).  
High-silicon \(acid-resistant; ASTM A861\) hub-and-spigot cast-iron  
pipe and fittings are manufactured for laboratory drainage service.  
Hub-and-spigot pipes are joined with caulked or compression  
gasket joints and hubless pipe with compression couplings.  
Cast-iron pipe is used for nonpressure, sanitary, and storm gravity  
drainage service above and below grade. The most commonly used  
pipe above grade is hubless, service-weight cast-iron; below grade it  
is service-weight, hub-and-spigot pipe with compression gaskets.  
High-silicon pipe uses caulked joints aboveground and sealing sleeves  
below grade. Some codes require extra-heavy class pipe below grade.

Carbon steel \(CS\) pipe is available in a variety of alloys, the most  
common being ASTM A53, for general service, and ASTM A106, for  
high-pressure, high-temperature service. Stainless steel \(SS\) pipe  
encompasses a variety of alloys and is widely used in the chemical,  
pharmaceutical, and food processing industries. The most com-  
monly used pipe types are type 304 and 316.  
Steel pipe is manufactured either seamless \(extruded\) or welded.  
Wall thickness, known as “schedule,” ranges from schedule 5  
\(thinnest\) to schedule 160 \(thickest\). Steel pipe can be joined by  
welding or with flanges or threaded joints.  
Available as either hard \(annealed\) or drawn \(soft\) temper, seam-  
less copper \(CU\) tube can be joined by soldering, brazing, flared  
joints, and flanges. It is manufactured for specific applications in  
the following types\:  
• ASTM B88\: Types K, L, and M \(thickest to thinnest wall\) are used  
primarily for potable water service and noncritical laboratory  
gases. Type L, hard temper, is often used aboveground, and type  
K, soft temper, underground.  
• ASTM B819\: Similar to ASTM B88, this tubing is cleaned for  
laboratory and healthcare facilities, and is available only in types  
K and L hard temper. It is joined most commonly by brazing.  
• ASTM B75\: Termed capillary tubing , this is available only in small  
diameters and soft temper, and is generally used to connect  
instruments in laboratory service. It is joined with flare joints  
and by soldering.  
• ASTM B280\: Type ACR is available only in small diameters and  
soft temper, and is generally used for air-conditioning and  
refrigeration service. It can be joined with flared fittings or by  
soldering.  
• ASTM B306\: Known as DWV, for drainage, waste, and vent, this  
tubing is used for drainage service and is joined by soldering. It  
has the thinnest wall of any copper product.  
• ASTM B837\: Type G is primarily used for fuel gas service. It is  
joined by using soldering and flare fittings.  
It is important to understand the definitions of the terms used in  
various consensus standards for plastic pipe\:  
• Standard dimensional ratio \(SDR\)\: The SDR is found by dividing  
the average outside diameter of a pipe by the wall thickness.  
This designation has yielded a series of preferred industry  
standard numbers that are constant for all sizes of pipe.  
• Dimensional ratio \(DR\)\: Often incorrectly used interchangeably  
with SDR, the DR is found in the same way as the SDR, and  
means the same thing, but is used when a product does not have  
the preferred SDR number established by prevailing standards.  
• OD controlled\: This designation is used when the outside diam-  
eter of a pipe is the controlling factor in its selection.  
• ID controlled\: This designation is used when the inside diameter  
of a pipe is the controlling factor in its selection.  
• Pressure rating \(PR\)\: This designation is used when the pres-  
sure rating is the controlling factor in the selection of a pipe.  
• Schedule\: This designation is used to match the standard dimen-  
sions for metallic pipe sizes. The pressure rating of the pipe  
varies with pipe size. Some standards use iron pipe size \(IPS\) in  
lieu of schedule to keep a wall thickness consistent with iron  
pipe.  
Plastic pipe can be joined with heat fusion \(either butt or socket  
fusion\), flanged joints, solvent cement, or threaded pipe of schedule  
80 wall thickness or greater. Consult manufacturers for specific  
recommendations.  
Brass pipe \(BR\) is made of an alloy of copper and zinc that con-  
forms to ASTM B43. The proportion of copper varies from 85 per-  
cent \(in red brass\) to 67 percent \(in yellow brass\). Brass pipe is  
joined by threading, soldering, brazing, or using flanged fittings.  
Larger brass pipes are used for potable water, and sometimes for  
branch drainage lines. Fittings and castings made from an alloy dif-  
ferent from the pipe may not be suitable for potable water service.  
Fittings are used to connect some pipes to one another, to change  
the direction of flow of fluids within a pipe, and to change the size  
of a pipe run. Often one fitting is used to provide all these features.  
An alternative to changing direction with fittings is to bend the pipe  
itself, but this method is rarely used except for soft-temper copper  
tubing.  
Drainage pipe requires special long-radius Y-type fittings to  
achieve the best flow characteristics. These fittings are called  
sanitary or drainage-type fittings .  
In general, fittings are made of the same material as the pipe to  
which they are attached, with the following exceptions\:  
• Fittings for copper tubing are either of a cast copper alloy that  
conforms to ANSI B16.18, or wrought copper that conforms to  
ANSI B16.22.4.  
• Threaded fittings for steel pipe are generally cast-iron pressure  
fittings that conform to ANSI B16.4, or malleable iron-banded  
fittings that conform to ANSI B16.3.  
Valve types include the following\:  
• Gate valves\: Gate valves have a wedge-shaped closure member  
seated into a metal recess. Used for on-and-off controls,  
generally for liquids, they are available in a wide variety of sizes,  
body shapes, stem configurations, body and internal materials,  
and pressure ranges. They are not recommended for throttling  
service, and they have low resistance to flow.  
• Globe valves\: Globe valves, named for the round shape of their  
body, have a closure member that is generally a disk sealed on  
a resilient seat. Body types include straight-through and angle  
configurations. Used primarily for throttling service, they have a  
high resistance to flow because of the diverted passage of fluid  
around the seat.  
• Plug valves\: Plug valves are named for the tapered, cylindrical  
closure member, which has a port through it that seals tightly on  
a resilient seat when turned. Classified as a quarter-turn valve,  
they are available either lubricated \(larger sizes\) or nonlubri-  
cated. They are used primarily for fuel gas service but also for  
both throttling and shutoff service. They have low resistance to  
flow and are well suited for power actuation.  
• Check valves\: Check valves prevent the reverse flow of fluids.  
The most commonly used check valves are lift and swing types,  
although ball closures are also available. When used for sanitary  
drainage service, check valves are referred to as backwater  
valves.  
• Butterfly valves\: Butterfly valves use a thin, rotating disk in the  
flow path as the closure member, seating on a resilient seal at  
the perimeter of the valve body. Classified as a quarter-turn  
valve, they are used for both throttling and shutoff service.  
When no leakage is desired, a “bubble-tight” seat is used.  
Butterfly valves have low resistance to flow and are well suited  
for power actuation.  
• Ball valves\: Ball valves are named for the round closure member  
that consists of a round port drilled through the valve and sealed  
tightly on a resilient seat when turned. Classified as a quarter-  
turn valve, the body is available in one-, two-, or three-piece  
construction. Used for throttling and shutoff service, ball valves  
are suitable for liquids and gases. They are well suited for power  
actuation and have low resistance to flow. They are often used  
for medical gas service when specifically cleaned and packaged  
for healthcare facilities.  
Glass pipe \(GL\) is made from a low-expansion borosilicate glass  
with a low alkali content. It is used for laboratory gravity waste  
service and is available in sizes up to 6 in. in diameter. Glass pipe  
must conform to ASTM C599.  
A joint is required to connect pipe to other pipe, a fitting, or a piece  
of equipment. The joint type selected for a particular application  
depends on the pipe material and wall thickness, pipe contents,  
system pressure, system temperature, disassembly requirements,  
and the applicable plumbing code.

Plastic \(PL\) has become the material of choice for piping systems  
used to convey a variety of liquids, including chemical drainage,  
pharmaceuticals, sewage, water, liquid fuel, and fuel gases. To  
convey potable water, plastic pipe must be listed by the National  
Sanitation Foundation \(NSF\) International.  
Plastic materials used for pipe are either thermoplastic or thermo-  
set . Thermoplastics \(the most commonly used pipe materials\)  
soften when heat is applied and reharden when cooled, so the pipe  
can be extruded or molded into shapes. Thermoset plastics must be  
cured by heating or with a curing chemical to achieve permanent  
shapes; once shaped, they cannot be reformed.  
Subclassifications of plastic pipe are based on the pipe material;  
the two most common are polyolefins and fluoroplastics .  
Valves are used to turn on or off, control the flow of, prevent the  
reverse flow of, and adjust the pressure of fluids in a piping sys-  
tem. Operation can be linear \(straight up and down\) or rotary  
\(multiturn or quarter turn\). Valves are classified by the shape of  
their closure member. Plastic valves, which are suitable for use in  
most utility services, are rapidly replacing metallic valves because  
of their increased corrosion resistance and lower cost. Valves are  
selected according to resistance to flow; throttling capability; sys-  
tem working pressure; intended service, such as WOG \(water, oil,  
gas\), WWP \(water working pressure\), or WSP \(working steam  
pressure\); and jointing method.

Whenever a water control valve closes very quickly in normal  
operation \(such as those installed on water closets and clothes-  
and dish-washing machines\), the sudden stopping of water starts  
a shock wave. This shock wave \(commonly called water hammer \)  
greatly increases pressure in the piping that over a period of time  
could cause the pipe or joint to fail. A shock absorber, installed in  
the water line between the source and the equipment, will lower  
the pressure to acceptable levels. The absorber size is based on  
line size, flow rate, and water pressure.  
The primary purpose of insulation is to retard the flow of heat and  
water vapor from pipes, ducts, and equipment. An insulation sys-  
tem consists of the insulation itself, a jacket to cover it, and, if  
needed, an additional jacket to provide specific characteristics  
\(such as weather protection or the ability to be repeatedly  
cleaned\). Code limitations for flame spread and amount of smoke  
developed established for components in fireproof and noncom-  
bustible buildings apply to these insulation system elements.  
The insulation materials described here are identified by generic  
names rather than manufacturers’ trade names.  
A jacket is any material \(excluding cement and paint\) that can be  
directly applied to insulation on a pipe, or vessel to cover or protect  
the insulation. The type of jacket chosen depends on the applica-  
tion. Jackets come in various forms and types, which can be  
divided into three general categories\: rigid \(plastic, aluminum, or  
stainless steel\), membrane \(glass cloth, coated papers, treated  
papers, and foil- or cloth-laminated papers\), and mastic. The most  
common jacket for fiberglass insulation is an all-service jacket  
\(ASJ\), which comprises laminated kraft paper, fiberglass cloth  
\(skrim\), and either aluminum foil or metalized film as a vapor bar-  
rier. This jacket type is sometimes called an FSK jacket, for foil,  
skrim, and kraft. When plumbing piping is exposed and aesthetics  
need to be considered, the design professional may choose spe-  
cific jackets that are able to be painted.

A plumbing fixture is a device or appliance that is designed to sup-  
ply water or receive waterborne waste, and may discharge into a  
sanitary waste system. Ideal fixture materials should be nonabsor-  
bent, nonporous, nonoxidizing, smooth, and easy to clean.  
Plumbing codes usually mandate the number and type of fixtures  
that must be provided for specific occupancy based on the capacity.  
Provisions for people with disabilities have been made an integral  
part of code requirements, mandating the quantity and design of  
spaces using plumbing fixtures.  
Every plumbing fixture is assigned a value known as a fixture unit  
\(FU\). FU values represent the probable flow of water the fixture will  
discharge into a sanitary waste system or use \(demand\) from a  
potable water supply system. The base value of 1 is assigned to a  
lavatory for both water demand and waste discharge; other fixtures  
are assigned comparative values as they relate to the lavatory.  
Waste discharge and water demand FUs are different; therefore  
the designations DFU, for drainage fixture units, and WFU, for  
potable water fixture units, can be used to differentiate them.  
Water closets, urinals, and bidets generally have two parts—a  
receptor for waste, which includes the drain trap and a flushing or  
water supply mechanism. Most are made of vitreous china. These  
plumbing fixtures are generally grouped according to their flushing  
action, which affects the bowl type, flushing mechanism, and  
mounting method.

resembles, but is a form of lavatory.  
13.53 a. Urinals require flush valves as the water supply source.  
b. If used, urinal tanks should be 92 to 94 in. above the floor.

Lavatories have a shallow receptor designed primarily for washing  
hands, arms, and face; sinks are generally deeper and designed  
for general washing and disposal of liquid waste. Sinks can include  
residential, commercial, and service applications.  
Lavatories are generally one of three types\: wall-hung, installed in  
or as a part of a countertop, and pedestal. Vitreous china is the  
most common material used in lavatories, though they are also  
available in cast acrylic resin and enameled cast iron, enameled  
steel, stainless steel, and other metals.  
Sink materials include stainless steel, enameled iron or steel, and  
cast resin. The underside of stainless steel sinks typically is coated  
with a sound-deadening material. Sink accessories may include  
pull-out faucets, instant hot or chilled water dispensers, soap dis-  
pensers, and disposers.

Pedestal lavatories may be either wall-mounted or freestanding.  
Consult manufacturers for specific designs, forms, and dimensions.  
direction can usually be adjusted; some jets can also be adjusted  
to deliver a pulsating or steady stream or to regulate intensity.  
Pumps range from 1/2 to 3 horsepower, and the intensity of the  
flow varies accordingly. In-line heaters are recommended to keep  
the water warm without refilling the tub.  
Built-in bathtubs have an integral apron and tiling flange, for instal-  
lation in a 3-wall alcove. Drop-in designs are intended for deck-  
mounted installations and typically have integral feet that support  
the weight of the unit. Many whirlpool bathtubs are drop-in units,  
though manufacturers may offer built-in units with a removable  
apron for access to the pump.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Bathtubs are available in many shapes, sizes, and styles including,  
rectangular, corner, and oval. Three types of installation are common  
including recessed, drop-in, and freestanding. Bathtub surrounds  
can be various materials, for example, ceramic tile, solid surfacing,  
molded fiberglass, or acrylic one-piece units. The surround material  
is important for coordination purposes during installation. Bathtubs  
are available in the following materials, though the fiberglass and  
acrylic units are the most common.  
• Fiberglass\: An economical and common choice, gel-coated fiber-  
glass \(also known as FRP\) is lightweight and easy to install.  
Because the material can be molded, fiberglass tubs are avail-  
able in a variety of shapes. Although not as durable as cast iron  
or acrylic, fiberglass can easily be repaired.  
• Acrylic\: Fiberglass reinforced acrylic is more durable than units  
constructed solely of fiberglass. Because acrylic is light and  
easily formed into various shapes, it is a good choice for whirl-  
pools and other large tubs that would be too heavy in cast iron.  
Acrylic is a good insulator and, thus, keeps water warm longer.  
• Cast iron\: Very heavy and extremely durable, traditional enamel-  
coated cast iron resists staining and scratching. It cannot be  
molded as freely as acrylic or fiberglass, so there are fewer  
shapes and styles from which to choose.  
• Enameled steel\: Because enameled steel is lighter weight it is a  
less expensive alternative to cast iron.  
Whirlpool bathtubs are usually made of fiberglass-reinforced  
acrylic, which can be fabricated in a variety of shapes. Air mixed  
with water streams through jets in the side of the tub, giving the  
whirlpool its soothing, therapeutic character. Models may have 3 to  
10 jets, including some aimed to massage feet, back, and neck. Jet  
Showers may be tub showers, shower stalls, or emergency show-  
ers. Tub showers are showers installed over a bathtub and usually  
share its water supply valve. The shower surround may be integral  
to the bathtub or site-built. Site-built shower enclosures are gener-  
ally three-sided with an impervious finish with either a shower  
door or curtain completing the enclosure.  
Shower stalls consist of a floor receptor topped by water-resistant  
walls, either self-supporting or attached to the wall framing.  
Receptors slope to a drain and may be manufactured or site-built.  
Manufactured shower stalls may also be one-piece plastic units  
with integral grab bars, seat, and other accessories.

Drinking fountains \(DF\) only use water at ambient temperatures;  
electric water coolers \(EWC\) use an integral or remote chiller to  
cool water for drinking. Some design guidelines are listed below.  
• Use air-cooled condensers for normal room temperatures and  
water-cooled units for high room temperatures and larger  
capacities. Many models are available with hot and cold water  
supplies, a cup-filling spout, or refrigerated compartments.  
• Install half of required fountains or water coolers as accessible,  
but design the layout so accessible fountains do not obstruct  
movement of the visually impaired.  
• Explosion-proof electric water coolers are recommended for use  
in hazardous locations. Corrosion-resistant fountains are avail-  
able for harsh environments.  
• Consult local building codes for the number of drinking fountains  
or water coolers required.

Facility storm drainage systems remove rainwater from all  
exposed portions of a building for discharge to an approved point  
of disposal. Roof drains and gutters are used to convey the storm-  
water. Other areas that require stormwater drainage include bal-  
conies, walkways, canopies, and areaways. Rainwater enters the  
stormwater drainage system by means of drains.  
There are two classifications of roof drainage\: conventional and  
controlled flow \(also called limited discharge \). Only the conven-  
tional roof drainage system, which removes stormwater as quickly  
as it falls, is discussed here. Information on controlled flow sys-  
tems can be obtained from manufacturers of roof drains and/or  
standard engineering references.  
Following are important design requirements\:  
• Most codes require a fail-safe method of removing excess rain-  
water from a roof before water accumulates to the point at  
which structural damage will occur. The preferred method is use  
of rectangular holes through the parapet \(called scuppers \) to  
allow water to drain down the side of the building. Another  
method places secondary drains immediately adjacent to the  
primary drain, but with a water inlet elevation about 3 in. higher  
than the roof. The applicable plumbing code must be consulted  
for the size, location, and routing of the secondary roof drainage  
system; the same is true for scuppers with the exception of  
routing.  
• The final point of disposal into a public sewer system may be  
either a stormwater sewer that accepts only stormwater, or a  
combined stormwater and sanitary sewer into which both types  
of effluent are drained.  
• When no public sewers are available, stormwater is discharged  
into dry wells, site gullies, watercourses, and recharge basins,  
which are large storage basins that allow water to both evapo-  
rate and be absorbed into the ground.  
Obtain this information before designing a stormwater drainage  
system\:  
• Ultimate point of disposal\: Find out whether stormwater on the  
site will drain to a storm sewer, a combined sewer, a water-  
course, a street, or a gully on the site.  
• Restrictions\: Find out whether any stormwater management  
programs or restrictions are in effect for the project site.  
• Jurisdiction\: Find out which authorities are responsible for  
approval of plumbing plans and installations at the site.  
Hose bibbs and wall hydrants are water supply fixtures on the  
exterior of a building used to attach hoses for cleaning and main-  
tenance purposes, such as washing walkways. Hose bibbs are  
typically exposed fixtures, while wall hydrants are concealed  
within a recessed wall box. If freezing conditions are even a  
remote possibility, a non-freeze-type fixture should be installed. To  
prevent backflow, wall hydrants should be provided with an inte-  
gral vacuum breaker.

The size of storm drainage lines is based on the area \(in square  
feet\) to be drained, the pitch of the pipe, and the rate of rainfall in  
inches per hour.  
To design a storm drainage system for a project\:  
• Begin by locating the roof or area drains and designing the pip-  
ing network.  
• Establish the rainfall rate, and calculate the area contributing  
rainwater to each drain, including the side wall area \(half of the  
area, in square feet, of any two adjacent vertical walls\).  
• At each design point, add all of the area \(in square feet\) for all  
drains together. In Figure 13.70, for sizing horizontal storm  
drainage piping, look under the pitch established for the piping  
in a project to find the figure that equals or exceeds the drain-  
age area calculated. Find the applicable pipe size in the column  
labeled “Diameter of Piping.” Use Figure 13.72 for sizing vertical  
storm drainage piping.

Facility storm drains include roof, area, and trench drains. A roof  
drain removes rainwater from roofs. Drains in other areas exposed  
to the weather such as balconies or canopies are called area  
drains. Both types of drain discharge the effluent into the storm  
drainage system. Specialized drain types are available for installa-  
tion in specific exposed or interior locations; consult drain manu-  
facturers for details.  
• Grate or dome\: This is the component that allows liquid into a  
drain body while excluding larger solids. Grates are available in  
a wide variety of shapes, slot configurations, materials, and  
load-bearing capability, from light to extra heavy. The high dome  
on the drain allows rainwater to enter the drain if some debris  
accumulates at the bottom. A generally accepted practice has  
the open area of a grate twice that of the discharge pipe.  
Generally, an adjustable grate allows the grate top to be  
adapted to the finished level.  
• Flange\: This is the part of the drain body that anchors the drain  
into the roof or walking surface.  
• Flashing ring\: This is provided to secure any flashing directly to  
the drain body, to prevent leakage around the drain. Often, roof  
drains are provided with an integral gravel stop to prevent  
gravel from ballasted roofing from entering the drain.  
• Under-deck clamp\: This is used to secure the drain body to a  
slab through an opening prior to the installation of any roof, slab  
finish, or piping.

Rainwater harvesting is experiencing a renewed interest due to  
the following\:  
• Escalating environmental and economic costs of providing water  
by centralized water systems or by well drilling  
• The relatively pure, soft, low-sodium water source that rainwa-  
ter harvesting offers  
• Health concerns over the source and treatment of polluted  
waters  
• A perception that there are cost efficiencies associated with  
reliance on rainwater  
Collecting rainwater is not only a way to conserve water but also  
to conserve energy, as the energy input required to operate a  
centralized water system designed to treat and pump water over a  
vast service area is bypassed. Rainwater harvesting also lessens  
local erosion and flooding caused by runoff from impervious cover  
such as pavement and roofs, as some rain is instead captured and  
stored.  
Rainwater quality almost always exceeds that of ground or surface  
waters\: It does not come into contact with soil and rocks, where it  
dissolves salts and minerals, and it is not subject to many of the  
pollutants that often are discharged into surface waters such as  
rivers, and which can contaminate groundwater. However, rainwa-  
ter quality can be influenced by where it falls, as localized industrial  
emissions affect its purity. Thus, rainwater falling in nonindustrial-  
ized areas can be superior to that in cities dominated by heavy  
industry, or in agricultural regions where crop dusting is prevalent.

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES PLUMBING  
Once rain comes in contact with a roof or collection surface, it can  
wash many types of bacteria, molds, algae, protozoa, and other  
contaminants into the cistern or storage tank. Health concerns  
related to bacteria, such as salmonella, E coli, and legionella, and  
to physical contaminants, such as pesticides, lead, and arsenic, are  
the primary criteria for drinking water quality analysis.  
If the rainwater is intended for potable uses such as drinking and  
cooking or for nonpotable uses including showering and toilet  
flushing, appropriate filtration and disinfection practices should be  
employed. If the rainwater is to be used exclusively for outside  
landscape irrigation, the presence of contaminants may not be of  
major concern, thus treatment requirements may be less stringent.  
Rainwater harvesting systems are composed of six basic  
components\:  
• Catchment area/roof\: The surface upon which the rain falls  
• Gutters and downspouts\: The transport channels from catch-  
ment surface to storage  
• Leaf screens and roof washers\: The systems that remove con-  
taminants and debris  
• Cisterns\: Where collected rainwater is stored  
• Conveying\: The delivery system for the treated rainwater, either  
by gravity or pump  
• Water treatment\: Filters and equipment, and additives to settle,  
filter, and disinfect  
Other than the roof, which is an assumed cost in most building  
projects, the cistern represents the largest investment in a rainwa-  
ter harvesting system. To maximize the efficiency of a system, the  
building design should reflect decisions about optimal placement,  
capacity, and material selection for the rainwater storage.  
Concerns such as color, taste, smell, and hardness comprise the  
secondary testing criteria used to evaluate publicly supplied water.  
When assessed according to these characteristics, rainwater often  
proves to be of better quality than well or municipal tap water.  
Inorganic impurities such as suspended particles of sand, clay, and  
silt contribute to the water’s color and smell. Proper screening and  
removal of sedimentation help to decrease problems caused by  
these impurities.  
Rainwater is the softest natural occurring water available, with a  
hardness of zero for all practical purposes. It naturally contains  
almost no dissolved minerals and salts, and is near distilled-water  
quality. The pH of rainwater would be 7.0 if there were nothing else  
in the air. However, as rain falls, it dissolves carbon dioxide that is  
naturally present in the air and, thus, becomes slightly acidic. The  
resultant pH is 5.6; however, any sulfates or nitrates dissolved  
from the air can lower this number. The catchment area is the surface on which the rain that will be  
collected falls. Although this discussion focuses on roofs as catch-  
ment areas, it’s important to point out that channeled gullies along  
driveways or swales in yards can also serve as catchment areas,  
collecting and then directing the rain to a French drain or bermed  
detention area. Rainwater harvested from catchment surfaces  
along the ground should only be used for lawn irrigation because  
of the increased risk of contamination. For potable use, the roofs  
of buildings are the primary catchment areas, which, in rural set-  
tings, can include outbuildings such as barns and sheds.  
For systems intended as potable water sources, no lead should be  
used as roof flashing or as gutter solder. The slightly acidic quality  
of rain can dissolve the lead and, thereby, contaminate the water  
supply. Existing houses and buildings should be fully examined for  
any lead content in the planning stages of any rainwater harvesting  
project.  
Cisterns are placed both above and below ground. While above-  
ground installations avoid the costs associated with excavation  
and certain maintenance issues, cisterns that are below ground  
benefit from the cooler year-round ground temperatures. To maxi-  
mize efficiency, cisterns should be located as close as possible to  
both the supply and demand points. And to facilitate the use of  
gravity or lower stress on a pump, the cistern should be placed on  
the highest level that is practical.  
Although the catchment area should not be shaded by trees, the  
cistern can benefit from the shade, as direct sunlight can heat the  
stored rainwater in the tank, which encourages algae and bacte-  
rial growth, which, subsequently, can lower water quality.  
To ensure a safe water supply, cisterns should be sited at least  
50 ft. away from sources of pollution, such as animal stables,  
latrines, or, if the tank is below ground, from septic fields. Cistern  
placement should also take into consideration the possible need to  
add water to the cistern from an auxiliary source, such as a water  
truck, in the event that the water supply is depleted due to overuse  
or drought conditions.  
Regardless of the type of cistern material selected, the cistern  
should have a durable, watertight exterior, and a clean, smooth  
interior, sealed with a nontoxic joint sealant. If the water is  
intended for potable use, the tank should be labeled as approved  
by the Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\), as should any sealants

or paints used inside the tank. A tight-fitting cover is essential to  
prevent evaporation, mosquito breeding, and to keep animals,  
children, and insects from entering the tank.  
This is because two smaller tanks of, for example, 1500 gallons  
each are generally more expensive than a single 3000-gallon tank.  
The primary benefit of a multitank system is that the system can  
remain operational if one tank must be shut down because of  
maintenance or leaking.  
Regardless of the cistern type chosen, regular inspection and  
proper maintenance are imperative to ensure reliability and safe,  
efficient operation. Remember that water is heavy\: a 500-gallon  
tank of water will weigh more than 2 tons, so a proper foundation  
and support are essential.

operation and maintenance, in accordance with the instruction  
manual for that specific filter, must be followed to ensure safety.  
Once large debris is removed by screens and roof washers, other  
filters are available that help improve rainwater quality.  
Screening, sedimentation, and prefiltering occur between catch-  
ment and storage, or within the cistern. The most common filter  
used for rainwater harvesting is a cartridge sediment filter that  
traps and removes particles of 5 microns or larger. Sediment filters  
used in series, referred to as multicartridge or in -line filters , sieve  
the particles from increasing to decreasing size. These sediment  
filters are often used as a prefilter for other treatment techniques  
such as ultraviolet light or reverse osmosis filters, which can  
become clogged from large particles. Unless something is being  
added to the rainwater, there is no need to filter out something that  
is not present.  
When a disinfectant such as chlorine is added to rainwater, an  
activated carbon filter at the tap may be used to remove the chlo-  
rine prior to use. However, activated carbon filters are subject to  
becoming sites of bacterial growth, therefore chemical disinfec-  
tants such as chlorine or iodine must be added to the water prior  
to the activated carbon filter. If ultraviolet light or ozone is used for  
disinfection, the system should be placed after the activated car-  
bon filter. Many water treatment standards require some type of  
disinfection after filtration with activated carbon. Ultraviolet light  
disinfection is often the method of choice. All filters must be  
replaced per the recommended schedule, rather than when they  
cease to work; failure to do so may result in the filter contributing  
to contamination of the water.  
receive the adequate level of UV radiation. The UV unit must be  
correctly calibrated and tested after installation to ensure that  
the water is being disinfected.  
• Ozone\: This is the disinfectant of choice in many European coun-  
tries, but until recently it had not been used in American water  
treatment facilities. Ozone is a form of oxygen \(O3\) produced by  
passing air through a strong electric field. Ozone readily kills  
microorganisms and oxidizes organic matter in the water into  
carbon dioxide and water. Any remaining ozone reverts back to  
dissolved oxygen \(O2\) in the water. Recent developments have  
produced compact ozone units for home use. Since ozone is  
produced by equipment at the point of use, with electricity as the  
only input, many rainwater catchment system owners use it to  
avoid handling chlorine or other chemicals. Ozone can also be  
used to keep the water in cisterns “fresh.” When used as the  
final disinfectant, it should be added prior to the tap, but after  
an activated carbon filter, if such a filter is used.  
• Chlorine or iodine for disinfecting\: Chlorine is the most com-  
mon disinfectant because of its dependability, water solubility,  
and availability. Granular or tablet form is available \(calcium  
hypochlorite\), but the recommended application for rainwater  
disinfecting is in a liquid solution \(sodium hypochlorite\).  
Chlorine-feed pumps that release small amounts of solution  
while the water is being pumped can also be used. Chlorine-  
metering pumps inject chlorine into the water only at the time  
of use. Chlorine is more effective than iodine at higher water  
temperatures and lower pH levels. Prolonged presence of  
chlorine where organic matter may be present may cause the  
formation of chlorinated organic compounds. If chlorine is used  
as a disinfectant, it is essential to screen all organic material  
from the tank.  
• Iodine\: This water disinfectant is less soluble than chlorine,  
although it is effective over a pH range of 5 to 9 and displays  
greater antibacterial activity in water temperatures of 75°F to  
98.6°F.  
Water pressure for a gravity system depends on the difference in  
elevation between the storage tank and the faucet. Water gains  
1 lb. per square inch of pressure for every 2.31 ft. of rise or lift.  
Many plumbing fixtures and appliances require 20 psi for proper  
operation, while standard municipal water supply pressures are  
typically in the 40 to 60 psi range. To achieve comparable pressure,  
a cistern would have to be 92.4 ft. \(2.31 ft. × 40 psi = 92.4 ft.\)  
above the home’s highest plumbing fixture. That explains why  
pumps are frequently used much in the same way they are used to  
extract well water. To approximate the water pressure from a  
municipal system, pressure tanks are often installed with the  
pump. Pressure tanks have a pressure switch with adjustable set-  
tings between 5 and 65 psi.  
Before making a decision about what type of water treatment  
method to use, water should be tested by an approved laboratory.  
Filtration can be as simple as the use of cartridge filters or those  
used for swimming pools and hot tubs. In all cases, proper filter  
Private systems do not disinfect to the extent of public water sys-  
tems where the threat of a pathogenic organism such as E coli can  
affect many households. If the harvested rainwater is used to  
wash clothes, to water plants, or to carry out other tasks that do  
not involve direct human consumption or contact, treatment  
beyond screening and sedimentation removal is optional. However,  
if the water is plumbed into the house for general indoor use such  
as for drinking, bathing, and cooking, disinfection is needed.  
Whereas filtering is quite common in private water systems, disin-  
fection is less common, for two reasons\:  
• The Safe Drinking Water Act is neither enforced nor applicable  
to private systems.  
• Chlorine is disliked because of taste, fear associated with triha-  
lomethanes \(THMs\), and other concerns.  
Common disinfection systems include\:  
• Ultraviolet radiation \(UV\)\: This type of water disinfection \(a  
physical process\) kills most microbiological organisms that pass  
through them. Because particulates offer a hiding place for  
bacteria and microorganisms, prefiltering is necessary for UV  
systems. To determine whether the minimum UV exposure is  
met, units should be equipped with a light sensor. Either an  
alarm or shutoff switch is activated when the water does not  
Baking soda is often used for buffering. The composition and pH of  
rainwater differs from chemically treated municipal water and  
mineral-rich well water. Controlling the pH of rainwater by buffer-  
ing can be easily accomplished by adding one level tablespoon of  
baking soda to the cistern for each 100 gallons of water collected.  
\(This amounts to about 4 ounces by weight of baking soda for every  
1000 gallons of water collected.\) An easy method is to mix this  
amount of baking soda in a jar of water and pour it into the tank.  
Mixing will occur naturally over a day or two; or a clean paddle may  
be used to hasten the process, but avoid disturbing materials that  
have settled at the bottom of the cistern.  
Some alternate types of treatment available include reverse osmo-  
sis \(RO\), nano-filtration, and several other “membrane” processes  
and distillation equipment that are designed primarily to remove  
dissolved materials such as salts or metals. However, rainwater  
contains extremely low levels of dissolved salts and is very soft.

The use of graywater would typically be considered under one of  
three project circumstances\: \(1\) an arid environment where water  
resources are substantially constrained; \(2\) a green building proj-  
ect where reduced water use is a part of an environmentally  
responsive solution; or \(3\) when a project objective is net-zero  
annual water use.  
Blackwater is biologically active, constitutes a health risk, and  
must be appropriately treated before discharge into the environ-  
ment. Such treatment occurs in a central sewage system or via  
local processing \(such as a septic system\). Graywater, by compari-  
son, is much less of a health hazard and potentially can be used for  
nonpotable water demands before final diversion into a treatment  
system. A graywater system seeks to use some portion of supplied  
potable water twice before releasing it to the final treatment sys-  
tem. It does so by diverting specific wastewater flows to storage  
\(and light treatment\) and then to a secondary use \(such as irriga-  
tion or flushing toilets\). When used for flushing toilets, graywater  
eventually ends up in the sewage waste stream; when used for  
irrigation, graywater ends up supporting plant growth or infiltrat-  
ing into the ground.  
Graywater \(or grey water\) is generally defined as building waste-  
water that does not include human waste or substantial organic  
material. This definition is typical—but not universal—and will  
vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In many locales, graywater  
sources include showers, bathtubs, and bathroom lavatories  
\(sinks\). Washing machines and laundry sinks are considered gray-  
water sources in some jurisdictions. Wastewater from water clos-  
ets \(toilets\), urinals, kitchen sinks, dishwashers, and wash water  
from diapers is termed blackwater. Because plumbing systems are  
highly regulated by codes, local regulations regarding graywater  
must be understood—both in terms of what is considered graywa-  
ter and in terms of potential uses for graywater.  
Some jurisdictions permit the use of graywater only for exterior  
irrigation \(potentially constrained to subsurface and/or surface  
delivery\). Some permit the use of graywater only for interior uses.  
Universally, graywater systems must be clearly identified by color  
coding/signage, must lightly treat \(normally involving filtration,  
disinfection, and perhaps dying\) the collected water before reuse,  
and must be installed to prevent any cross connection with a  
potable water system.  
Sizing a graywater system involves four generic steps. Step 1\:  
Estimate expected graywater flows. Step 2\: Estimate the desired  
capacity of graywater uses \(irrigation needs; toilet flushing\).  
Step 3\: Balance resources and needs to develop an economical  
system arrangement. Step 4\: Comply with all applicable codes.

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR-CONDITIONING \(HVAC\)  
# HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR-CONDITIONING \(HVAC\)  
An HVAC system is an active climate control system that includes  
heating/cooling source equipment, distribution and delivery com-  
ponents, and controls. Thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air  
quality are the primary system objectives. Energy efficiency tech-  
niques are commonly applied to HVAC systems.  
Although shelter from the weather and protection from harsh cli-  
mates are historic reasons for constructing buildings, the mere act  
of building does not in itself result in desirable and acceptable  
interior environments. Thus, climate control is a critical perfor-  
mance attribute of a successful building, and the creation of a  
comfortable, healthy environment for occupants is an important  
goal of the design process. HVAC systems may also include refrig-  
eration for manufacturing, processing, and storage.  
An HVAC system is a requirement in virtually all types and sizes of  
buildings. Second only to structural makeup, HVAC represents a  
technical area of design that must be generally understood and  
properly coordinated during the design process.  
HVAC systems have a significant impact on the budget and space  
allocations for a facility because they\:  
• Represent a substantial percentage of the construction budget  
for most facility types  
• Can consume up to 10 percent of the floor area of a building  
• Reach into and affect aesthetically most building spaces  
• Contribute greatly to facility energy use and operating expense  
• Account for the majority of occupant complaints  
• In processing, manufacturing, and storage facilities, HVAC may  
be critical to the basic function and operation of the facility.  
HVAC has a major impact on occupant satisfaction, on facility con-  
struction and operating costs, and, often, on building layout and  
spatial efficiency.  
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-  
Conditioning Engineers \(ASHRAE\) definition of HVAC describes a  
system that must be able to simultaneously control\:  
• Temperature  
• Relative humidity  
• Air speed  
• Quality of air in occupied spaces  
These four factors generally overlay the factors that define ther-  
mal comfort and indoor air quality—mean radiant temperature  
\(MRT\) being the critical exception.  
Increasing demands for control of indoor air quality tend to require  
the design and installation of quality HVAC. Of the three primary  
means of mitigating indoor pollutants—source control, filtration,  
and dilution—dilution \(through ventilation and exhaust\) and filtra-  
tion \(through system and equipment selection\) are directly related  
to HVAC design, installation, and operation.

ASHRAE \(American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-  
Conditioning Engineers\) standards and guidelines dominate the  
design of HVAC systems. AHRI \(Air-Conditioning, Heating, and  
Refrigeration Institute\) standards dominate equipment certifica-  
tions. Federal requirements establish minimum equipment effi-  
ciency thresholds. A series of Advanced Energy Design Guides  
\(available through ASHRAE\) provide recommendations for  
designing a variety of building types to substantially exceed code-  
mandated energy performance. HVAC systems will play a key role  
in achieving green building certification under LEED or Green  
Globes. Key standards affecting the design of most commercial/  
institutional projects include\:  
• ASHRAE Standard 90.1, “Energy Standard for Buildings Except  
Low-Rise Residential Buildings”  
• ASHRAE Standard 55, “Thermal Environmental Conditions for  
Human Occupancy”  
• ASHRAE Standard 62.1, “Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air  
Quality”  
• ASHRAE Guideline 0, “The Commissioning Process”  
There is almost always one or more higher efficiency alternatives.  
In addition, efficiency standards apply to specific equipment—and  
not to whether that equipment is the most efficient choice for a  
given task. Alternative source types should be considered, as well  
as efficiency within a type.  
Controls are also on the critical path to energy efficiency and con-  
servation. Control schemes should turn off equipment when not  
needed \(conservation\) and optimize equipment operation when in  
use \(efficiency\). Proportional control approaches \(such as variable  
air volume distribution/delivery, variable frequency motor drive  
controllers, and variable flow rate distribution arrangements\) offer  
great promise for higher efficiencies at part-load operation.  
The energy intensity of distribution subsystem designs should be  
considered. This includes fans, pumps, duct and pipe sizing, and the  
fundamental decision of whether to use air or water to distribute  
heating/cooling effect. Delivery components can affect energy  
efficiency via pressure drop requirements—but the main focus on  
these components is effectiveness.  
Displacing fossil-fuel energy consumption through the use of  
renewable energy can be very effective in conserving energy.  
Passive solar heating can displace gas/electricity use; natural  
ventilation can displace electricity. In many climates, passive sys-  
tems cannot provide comfort or acceptable air quality in extremes  
of weather—nevertheless during the times when they are effec-  
tive they reduce the use of nonrenewable energy resources and  
reduce carbon emissions.  
Materials and water conservation\: This is an area not being  
addressed for HVAC systems in most green building evaluations.  
Local sourcing of products should be considered \(when possible\) to  
reduce energy and pollution associated with transportation of  
system components. Opportunities for water reclamation and  
selection of low-water-demand equipment \(such as condensers\)  
may be considered.  
The design process for an HVAC system is similar to that used for  
the overall building design. The first steps in the design process are  
nontechnical and generally independent of the system solution  
eventually chosen. Active involvement of the project architect in  
these first steps is critical to a successful design.  
HVAC design should begin with a clear and explicit statement of  
what the system is expected to do. Design intent should ideally be  
defined during the programming phase of a project but certainly no  
later than the early stage of schematic design. Design intent should  
examine the operation of HVAC under all possible conditions \(week-  
days, weekends, emergencies, and predictable renovations\). The  
process of defining the intent will lead to explicit design criteria—  
measurable targets for system performance—that can be used to  
select an appropriate system.  
HVAC \(active climate control\) systems are installed to provide  
interior environments that occupants will judge to be thermally  
comfortable and to provide indoor air quality that will be healthful  
and acceptable. These fundamental objectives behind HVAC system  
design must be remembered when addressing sustainability. Safe  
and equitable system outcomes are as much a part of sustainable  
design as energy and resource conservation. HVAC systems must  
be effective as well as efficient. A system can be highly effective,  
but very inefficient; or very efficient, but dismally ineffective. A  
reasonable middle ground between efficiency and effectiveness is  
the goal.  
HVAC systems can account for half the annual energy consumption  
in many building types—especially as the energy demands of light-  
ing are reduced through skillful daylighting. The design team for a  
building striving for greater sustainability must consider the impact  
of HVAC systems on energy consumption. Secondarily, the impact  
on water and materials consumption should be addressed.  
Energy efficiency and conservation\: An HVAC system consists of  
four functional subsystems\: \(1\) source components—which pro-  
duce heating and cooling effect, including chillers and boilers;  
\(2\) distribution components—which convey heating/cooling and  
ventilation effects to the zones in a central system; \(3\) delivery  
components—which introduce heating/cooling/ventilation effects  
into the various spaces/zones; and \(4\) controls.  
Source components are critical when considering energy efficiency  
\(increasing output—heating or cooling effect—while decreasing  
energy input\). A large percentage of the energy used by HVAV  
systems passes through the source components, placing them on  
a critical path toward efficiency. The federal government sets mini-  
mum efficiency standards for HVAC source equipment, which are  
embedded in energy codes. These are legally minimum efficiencies.  
An HVAC zone is an area of a facility \(not necessarily coincident  
with a room or rooms\) that requires a separate controller to  
provide conditions amenable to thermal comfort. Such control is  
typically provided by a thermostat that senses room air tempera-  
ture. Thus, each thermal zone has its own thermostat.  
Ideally, any area of a facility that responds to loads differentially  
across time from other areas should be considered for separate  
control. Such differential response usually is caused by the timing  
of loads, with solar orientation, fenestration, occupant use, and  
equipment loads affecting this timing. For example, an office with  
east-facing glazing should not be controlled from a thermostat in  
an office \(even if adjacent\) with south-facing glazing. A conference  
room should not be controlled from an office, even if solar expo-  
sures are the same, as the occupancy schedules and loads are  
different.  
Zoning is a critical part of the HVAC design process and should  
involve the active participation of the design professional. Providing  
too many zones wastes money, while providing too few may cause  
discomfort. Establishing appropriate zones is as much a qualitative  
as a quantitative process, one that requires a clear understanding  
of facility function and owner expectations. Zones are so critical to  
HVAC success that many systems are defined primarily by their  
zoning capabilities. As zoning depends on building layout, it should  
occur during schematic design.  
Technically, the term “HVAC” refers to an active climate control  
system. Climate affects the design of an HVAC system in several  
ways, including the following.  
• It determines building code envelope requirements, which  
affect heat gains and losses.  
• It will influence system selection by making a heating-focused  
or cooling-focused system a more appropriate choice.  
• It will influence the selection and placement of delivery devices  
\(such as baseboard radiators or diffusers\).  
• It will determine the feasibility of an air-side economizer  
system.  
• It will influence the selection of condensing units \(air-cooled  
versus water-cooled\).  
• It will determine the feasibility of heat/energy recovery  
ventilators.  
Expanding the concept of HVAC to passive climate control systems,  
climate is the deciding factor in establishing the feasibility of such  
systems—including passive solar heating, natural ventilation, and  
other passive cooling approaches.  
Nonresidential buildings will typically be pressurized \(maintained  
at a positive pressure relative to the outdoors\) as a means of  
controlling airflow through the building envelope—in order to  
improve occupant comfort, promote indoor air cleanliness, and \(to  
some extent\) reduce degradation of building enclosure assemblies.  
Such pressurization is established by balancing the volume of out-  
door air intake to the HVAC system against exhaust airflows \(such  
as from bathroom, kitchen, and lab hood exhausts\) and leakage  
\(exfiltration\) through the building envelope.

chillers, cooling towers, air-handling units, and diffusers\) to meet  
load and performance requirements, as well as design of numer-  
ous field-fabricated components \(such as ductwork and piping\) to  
connect and support the major equipment items.  
In a typical building, most of the HVAC components are hidden from  
view behind mechanical room walls or above suspended ceilings.  
Thus, detailed design is driven by considerations of functionality  
and economics. Two exceptions to this “no-see” situation are the  
air supply and return devices \(and/or water terminal units\) and the  
exterior condenser.  
HVAC systems may place substantial space and volume demands  
on a building and tend to interact with virtually all other building  
elements; key activities for coordinating these elements include  
the following\:  
• Ensuring HVAC design intent supports overall facility design  
intent  
• Coordinating HVAC zones with other system zones \(fire protec-  
tion and alarm, lighting, and smoke control\)  
• Locating major equipment components to minimize distribution  
length and size, and to minimize negative aesthetic impacts  
• Locating major equipment components to minimize negative  
impacts on room acoustics, circulation patterns, and facility  
flexibility  
• Coordinating air distribution with elements of other systems,  
such as structural beams and columns, lighting fixtures, and  
plumbing and fire protection piping  
• Locating terminal devices \(such as VAV or mixing boxes\) and  
control devices \(such as valves, dampers, and actuators\) so they  
are accessible for regular maintenance  
• Giving more than rudimentary consideration to selection of air  
supply and return devices, such as diffusers, registers, and  
grilles. \(These devices can have a dramatic effect on thermal  
and acoustic comfort and on aesthetics.\)  
• Coordinating controls with design intent. Although controls are  
highly technical in implementation, failures are often conceptual.  
• Providing operations and maintenance manuals and procedures  
to assist the owner in operating the HVAC system  
The outdoor airflow rate for most buildings is established by ven-  
tilation airflow requirements related to acceptable indoor air  
quality. Minimum outdoor airflow requirements \(in ASHRAE  
Standard 62.1\) are expressed in cfm per occupant plus cfm per unit  
area of floor. Air change rates are not commonly specified—with  
the critical exception of healthcare facilities \(where room air  
change rates are a measure of air turnover for control of patho-  
gens\) and residential occupancies \(where outdoor air change rate  
is a figure of merit for air tightness\).  
Pressurization of interior spaces relative to other interior spaces  
is critical, and code mandated, in healthcare facilities; it is also  
important in laboratory buildings, and for some typical building  
spaces such as bathrooms and shops.  
the design process that a system can be selected, the greater the  
opportunity for system coordination.  
Characteristics to consider during the selection process include\:  
lifecycle cost \(including purchase, installation, and operating costs\),  
energy consumption, space and volume requirements, noise, vibra-  
tion, locational flexibility, operational flexibility, adaptability to  
changes in occupancy and/or room layout, ventilation capabilities,  
smoke control capabilities, aesthetics, reliability, maintainability,  
appropriateness to owner/operator personnel resources, and  
capability to provide thermal comfort. The relative importance of  
these characteristics, as well as system capabilities, will vary from  
project to project. Use of a project-specific, weighted selection  
matrix can assist in the selection process.  
HVAC selection is a sophisticated process. Normally, several sys-  
tem types could function adequately in a given building context.  
Careful matching of system characteristics to design criteria can  
help achieve the best match for the system intent. The earlier in  
The specifics of HVAC design are normally assigned to a mechani-  
cal engineer with the appropriate expertise. The detailed design,  
normally conducted during the design development phase, involves  
selection of a number of manufactured equipment items \(such as  
A passive solar heating system can displace all, a substantial part  
of, or some portion of annual heating demands—depending upon  
system design and project climate. Even where a passive heating  
system cannot reasonably handle all heating needs—necessitat-  
ing installation of a backup active heating system—the passive  
system can contribute to efforts to reach net-zero energy status  
without the installation of a larger-than-necessary PV or wind  
system and, perhaps more importantly, reduce carbon emissions  
related to building heating. There are three basic passive heating  
system configurations\: direct gain, indirect gain, and isolated gain.  
A direct gain system is essentially south-facing glazing coupled  
with interior thermal mass, with appropriate solar and heat loss  
control mechanisms. There are three distinct forms of indirect gain  
systems\: Trombe walls, water walls, and roof ponds. Isolated gain  
systems typically take the form of a sunspace.

A passive cooling system uses an exterior condition \(such as dry-  
bulb air temperature, soil temperature, or night sky temperature\)  
as a heat sink where heat from a building interior can be dumped.  
As opposed to a passive heating system that obtains substantial  
heat flow from one source—solar radiation, passive cooling sys-  
tems typically seek appropriate heat sinks in the face of challeng-  
ing exterior conditions. The capacity of most heat sinks is inversely  
proportional to cooling demands—the greater the need for cool-  
ing, usually the lower the capacity of passive cooling systems.  
Nevertheless, a passive cooling system can reduce climate control  
energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with space  
cooling.  
There are a number of passive cooling systems in use in a range of  
building types. These are commonly classified as direct, indirect, or  
isolated loss systems; alternatively, they are described as convec-  
tive, radiative, conductive, or evaporative cooling systems on the  
basis of the primary heat flow mode. Typical system types include\:  
cross ventilation, stack ventilation, cool towers, evaporative sys-  
tems, and earth tubes. Of these, natural ventilation \(cross and  
stack\) systems are the most common.  
Key factors in the success of a natural ventilation system include\:  
• Exterior \(heat sink\) conditions—both dry-bulb temperature and  
relative humidity; an interior space can be ventilated no lower  
than the ambient outdoor air temperature and/or relative  
humidity, and usually only within a differential \(outdoor minus  
indoor\) temperature of around 3ºF.  
• Aperture size, which controls the volume of air that can enter \(or  
exit\) the building; the smallest aperture in the line of airflow will  
control the system capacity.  
• Driving force—wind speed for cross ventilation and buoyancy  
\(as a result of height and temperature difference\) for stack  
ventilation; the greater the wind speed or buoyancy, the greater  
the ventilation airflow.  
• Interior obstructions will block or constrain airflow; the path for  
ventilation air must be essentially unobstructed from inlet aper-  
ture to outlet aperture; this is a serious design challenge in  
many building types.

\(such as pumps, fans, ducts, and diffusers\). Although mechanical  
engineers usually design an HVAC system, its interactions with the  
building must be coordinated with the entire project team.  
HVAC systems are categorized by scale and by means of energy  
transfer to and from occupied spaces of a facility\:  
• Local system\: Serves only a single space, and all of the system  
components are usually located in or directly adjacent to the  
space being conditioned. Distribution and delivery elements are  
bundled with the source equipment.  
• Central system\: Serves multiple spaces, and the major compo-  
nents are usually located in a dedicated mechanical room or  
rooms. Distribution and delivery elements are separate from the  
source equipment—and may be air or water based.  
• District system\: Serves multiple buildings \(as in a campus or  
central business district heating-cooling loop\), with major com-  
ponents located in a dedicated plant.  
Local systems are typically smaller-capacity systems intended to  
provide climate control for a single space/room in a building.  
Examples include window air conditioners, through-the-wall air-  
conditioners, unit heaters, ductless mini-split systems, fireplaces,  
wood stoves, electric baseboard heaters, and the like. Architectural  
coordination for local systems involves placement of a device  
within a space—with due consideration for aesthetics, noise, and  
control capabilities.  
Electric energy is ideally suited for local space heating because it is  
simple to distribute and control. Electric heating systems are widely  
used in residences and schools, as well as commercial and indus-  
trial facilities. Heating units are placed in individual rooms or spac-  
es, but may be combined into zones with automatic temperature  
controls. Electric in-space heating systems may use natural convec-  
tion, radiant, or forced-air units.  
Natural convection units for wall or floor placement \(and surface  
or recessed installations\) have elements of bare incandescent  
wire, bare low-temperature wire, or sheathed wires. A liner or  
reflector is usually placed between elements so that part of the  
heat output is distributed by radiation and part by convection.  
Small-capacity units \(up to about 1650 W\) operate at 120 V; higher-  
capacity units operate at 208 V or more. Because natural convec-  
tion air currents are critical to the distribution of heat from these  
units, they must be installed so that airflow across the resistor  
element will not be impeded.

Forced-air units combine convection heating with fan-powered air  
circulation. Such units are available in a wide range of capacities  
to suit a variety of heating loads and occupancy types. Unit ventila-  
tors are commonly located on an outside wall, where they have  
access to outdoor air intake and can prevent cold-air downdrafts  
from window areas.  
economic alternative to electric resistance heating. Gas heating  
systems are widely used in a range of building types. In a local  
system, heating units are placed in individual rooms or spaces \(but  
may be combined into zones with automatic temperature controls\).  
Because gas heating is a combustion process, gas-heating devices  
must be provided with a flue to remove products of combustion and  
with outdoor air to support the combustion process.  
Infrared heating units are designed primarily to heat objects,  
rather than space. Current flowing through a high-resistance wire  
heats up the element or surface of the unit. Heat is transferred  
from the unit to surfaces or occupants primarily by radiation.  
Manufacturers’ recommendations for installation clearance should  
be followed. For an effective system, it is important to locate radi-  
ant heating units carefully in relation to the objects being heated.  
Gas \(natural gas or propane\) is well-suited for local and central  
space heating because it is often readily available and provides an

piping and power vent may be eliminated.

Most local cooling systems are direct expansion \(DX\) systems. The  
term “direct expansion” means that a refrigerant flows through  
the system cooling coil to remove heat from a space. Direct-  
expansion systems come in cooling only or heat pump configura-  
tions; a heat pump can provide either heating or cooling.  
The most common direct-expansion system is a unitary or pack-  
aged unit installed through the wall or in a window. These can also  
be floor-mounted in or out of the air-conditioned space, or located  
on the roof.  
Another type of direct-expansion system is the “split” system, in  
which the heat rejection components \(the condenser\) and the  
compressor are packaged separately and located remotely from  
the evaporator and fan, which must be in the air-conditioned space.  
The two subassemblies, which are attached to the system with  
refrigerant piping, may be as close as on opposite sides of a wall  
or separated by up to 100 ft.  
compression or absorption\), boilers \(electric, gas, oil, coal\),  
cooling towers or air-cooled condensers, heat pumps, and solar  
collectors.  
• Distribution subsystem\: Distribution components involve trans-  
fer of a heating/cooling effect from the source to occupied  
spaces, and typically include ductwork, piping, air-handling units  
\(with fans, filters, coils, and accessories\), pumps, standalone  
fans, and air terminal units.  
• Delivery subsystem\: Delivery components are used to introduce  
a heating/cooling effect into the occupied spaces, and typically  
include baseboard radiators, unit heaters, convector cabinets,  
fan-coil units, induction units, diffusers, and radiant panels.  
• Controls subsystem\: Controls provide for the safe, effective, and  
efficient operation of an HVAC system.  
Central systems are categorized by the means of heat transfer  
used to convey heat to and from the spaces served by the system.  
Two primary media are used for this purpose\: water and air.  
Water is a very effective means of transferring heat, requiring  
substantially less volume to move a given quantity of heat than is  
possible with air as a medium. For the same heating or cooling  
load, the water distribution piping will be several times smaller  
than an equivalent air distribution duct. On the other hand, air  
distribution is convenient, because the air used to transport heat-  
ing or cooling from a central location can simply be skillfully  
dumped into the space. Water distribution systems require some  
type of terminal device to exchange heat between the water and  
the air in the space to be cooled.  
Those central systems that use only air to distribute heating and  
cooling effects to the occupied spaces are called all-air systems,  
and require a ductwork distribution tree. An all-water system uses  
only water to supply and remove heat from the spaces; such a  
system requires a piping distribution network. Air-water systems  
deliver both air and water to the occupied spaces and require both  
ductwork and piping distribution networks.  
Central system components are distributed throughout a facility,  
with a range of equipment choices available for most systems.  
HVAC system components can be grouped into subsystems, includ-  
ing source, distribution, delivery, and control components.  
• Source subsystem\: Source components involve the generation  
of a heating or cooling effect and typically include chillers \(vapor

Boilers produce hot water or steam for use in space conditioning,  
heating of domestic hot water, and/or process requirements. A  
boiler may be electric or combustion \(with a variety of fuel types  
available\). Key considerations in selecting a boiler \(beyond fuel  
type\) include\: capacity and efficiency. Applications include single-  
family residences, buildings of all scales, and district systems.  
A combustion boiler will require makeup air and a flue \(or breech-  
ing\). Burner efficiency depends on the proper combustion of fuel  
\(air-fuel ratio\) and the maintenance \(annual tune-up\) of the burner.  
To handle a boiler properly and efficiently, the maintenance staff  
must be trained to operate the unit and to conduct efficiency tests,  
which include testing for CO2, stack temperature, smoke, and draft.  
Air pollution regulations must be considered for larger installations.  
Boiler capacity ratings are expressed as\:  
• Gross rating = input in Btu/hr. \(found on equipment plates\)  
• Net rating = output in Btu/hr. = gross rating × efficiency  
\(found on equipment plates\)

A chimney should be supported on a foundation of masonry, rein-  
forced concrete, or other noncombustible material having a mini-  
mum fire-resistance rating of three hours. When installed on a  
boiler \(or other appliance\), the chimney should be supported so  
that it does not place excessive stress on the appliance. The base  
of the chimney should be secured to prevent movement of the  
chimney; anchor lugs should be used for this purpose whenever  
possible. A cleanout section may be used in the chimney assembly  
but must not be used above the chimney inlet.  
An enclosed chimney may be placed adjacent to walls of combus-  
tible material with the following minimum clearances\:  
• 10 to 15 in. I.D. requires 16 in. clearance  
• 15 to 21 in. I.D. requires 18 in. clearance  
• 21 to 27 in. I.D. requires 20 in. clearance  
• 27 to 36 in. I.D. requires 22 in. clearance  
Where the chimney passes through a roof of combustible material,  
it must be installed with an insulated thimble and flashing. This  
insulated thimble may be installed at 0-in. clearance to combusti-  
bles. The chimney should extend at least 3 ft. above the highest  
point where it passes through the roof, and 2 ft. higher than any  
ridge within 10 ft.  
Chimneys of the medium-heat appliance or commercial industrial  
incinerator type are not intended to be enclosed in walls of combus-  
tible materials. These chimneys should be placed in fire-resistive or  
noncombustible shafts, where they extend through any floor–ceiling  
assembly above the location of the connected appliance.  
The purpose of a vent stack is to conduct the products of combus-  
tion to a point of safe discharge \(atmosphere\). Forced-draft design  
eliminates the need for a stack designed to create a draft. An offset  
type of stack connection to the stub vent on the boiler is preferred.

A direct vertical connection can also be made when boiler vent  
outlets can withstand the direct vertical load of the stack, including  
the effect of wind and guy wires.  
Refer to state and local codes and ordinances and manufacturers’  
literature for requirements governing installation, maintenance,  
clearances, gas piping, combustion air, and venting in specific  
situations.  
Condensing furnaces are high-efficiency units that extract heat  
from exhaust gases to the point at which water and combustion  
by-products are condensed out of the gases. The condensed water  
is typically disposed of in a floor drain. These furnaces contain a  
multipass heat exchanger that recovers enough heat from the flue  
gas to yield annual fuel utilization efficiencies \(AFUEs\) in the range  
of 90 to 97 percent. Because the resulting flue gases are at a very  
low temperature, they can be vented directly through a roof or  
sidewall via plastic pipe and do not require a chimney.  
Condensing furnaces can reduce heating costs when compared to  
noncondensing furnaces with typical AFUEs \(in the range of 60 to  
80 percent\). As such, a condensing furnace is highly recommended  
for colder climates where heating costs are a major portion of the  
annual utility bill.  
At the earth’s surface, the solar irradiance falling on a horizontal  
surface varies from 0 at sunrise and sunset to a maximum of about  
330 Btu/hr.-sq. ft. at solar noon on a clear day at sea level. This  
value varies with altitude and with latitude. The National Renewable  
Energy Laboratory \(NREL\) website provides valuable data on aver-  
age daily solar radiation on various surfaces by month of year  
including the following\:  
• http\://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old\_data/nsrdb/1961–1990/blue  
book/state.html\: In the Solar Radiation Data Manual for  
Buildings , data is listed by city and are given for global diffuse,  
and for clear-day global. “Global” refers to the sum of direct  
\(beam\) radiation and diffuse radiation on a surface.  
• http\://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/redbook/\: In the Solar  
Radiation Data Manual for Flat-Plate and Concentrating  
Collectors , global data are provided for flat-plate collectors at  
varying orientations; and direct \(beam\) radiation is provided for  
tracking, concentrating collectors.  
Solar energy reaches the earth’s surface in the form of electro-  
magnetic radiation in the wavelength band between approximately  
0.3 and 3.0 micrometers \(μm\). Outside the earth’s atmosphere, at  
the mean earth-sun distance \(about 93 million miles\) the radiant  
flux density on a surface normal to the sun’s rays is about 437 Btu/  
hr.-sq. ft. This solar flux varies annually by about plus or minus  
3 percent due to the earth’s elliptical orbit, and is also subject to  
minor variations due to solar flares.  
Four types of thermal collectors are commonly used\:  
• Flat-plate collectors  
• Concentrating collectors  
• Compound parabolic concentrators \(CPCs\)  
• Evacuated tube collectors

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR-CONDITIONING \(HVAC\)  
Solar energy can be put to use at low and moderate temperatures  
by flat-plate collectors in which a blackened surface is used to  
absorb the incoming radiation and convert it to heat. This heat is  
then conducted to a fluid that passes through tubes or passages  
integral with or attached to the absorber surface. To minimize loss  
of heat from the absorber, glazing \(single or double, of glass or a  
heat-resistant plastic\) is used to reduce convection losses and to  
suppress long-wave radiation exchange with the sky. The rear side  
of the absorber is insulated, typically with glass fiber or foam  
insulation that can stand the relatively high temperatures \(300°F to  
400°F\) that can exist under “stagnation” conditions. Stagnation  
occurs when the collector is exposed to full sunshine with no heat  
transfer fluid flowing through it. The entire unit is contained within  
a weatherproof box, and connecting pipes or ducts are provided to  
bring the fluid to the collector and to carry it away after being  
heated. The inlet and outlet ports are at diagonally opposite corners  
of the collector to provide even flow through the parallel passages.  
Details of many types of flat-plate collectors are given in Chapter  
35 of the ASHRAE Handbook\: HVAC Applications \(2015\). The Solar  
Rating & Certification Corporation \(SRCC; www.solar-rating.org\)  
performs independent testing and certification of collectors and  
systems.  
For swimming pool heating applications, which involve relatively  
low collection temperatures, collectors are often unglazed, and the  
absorber surface may be metal or plastic. However, for most appli-  
cations the absorber surface is a metal such as copper, which has  
the good heat conduction properties desired of absorbers.  
When high temperatures are required for industrial process heat-  
or power-generation applications, concentrating collectors must  
be used. These reflect or refract solar radiation onto a relatively  
small absorber surface, thus reducing the surface available for  
heat loss and enabling the fluid to attain temperatures that can  
exceed 1000°F. Such collectors must “track the sun” because they  
can only use the direct beam radiation from the sun. Some con-  
centrating collectors can remain essentially fixed, but these are  
limited to concentration ratios of less than about 3\:1, and thus  
moderate collection temperatures.  
There are two collector designs that fall between the flat-plate and  
common concentrating collector\: the compound parabolic concen-  
trator \(CPC\) and the evacuated tube collector. Each of these  
designs permits collection in the moderate temperature range of  
about 150°F to 400°F. The evacuated tube design achieves better  
performance at higher temperatures by enclosing the absorbers in  
evacuated tubes, thus reducing losses. The CPC design achieves  
this by a novel type of concentration.  
A system for using solar energy consists of an array of collectors;  
a thermal storage unit; and piping or ducting to distribute fluid  
between the collectors, storage, and the load. Pumps or blowers  
are used to circulate the heat transfer fluid, and control devices are  
used to actuate the circulators. Auxiliary or standby heat sources  
are generally needed to carry part of the load when demand is  
heavy and/or the weather has been unfavorable.

Figure 13.92 shows a simple system for providing space heating  
and domestic hot water, using a drain-down design in which the  
collectors are emptied to the storage tank whenever Pump No. 1  
stops. A controller senses the temperature difference between the  
collector plate and the tank water and starts the circulation in  
Pump No. 1 when this difference exceeds a set value. This set dif-  
ference is such that negligible thermal energy is collected for val-  
ues below the set value.  
Since solar thermal collectors work more efficiently when the  
temperature difference between the collector and the ambient air  
is low, fan-coil units with large areas of finned-tube heat transfer  
surface are generally selected for the space heating assignment.  
These can be used with water temperatures as low as 90°F. The  
auxiliary heat source in solar installations could be electricity, fuel  
oil, or natural gas.  
Solar hot water \(by itself\) is one of the most attractive and cost-  
effective of solar applications. Figure 13.93 depicts a closed-loop  
design with an external heat exchanger, which isolates the domes-  
tic water from the collector loop fluid. In this case, antifreeze is  
likely the collector loop fluid, and an expansion tank is incorporated  
as appropriate. Other designs incorporate a smaller drain-down  
tank in the collector loop, which permits water, instead of anti-  
freeze, to be used in the collector loop.  
Domestic hot water is typically provided by an immersed coil  
located near the top of the main storage tank. The domestic hot  
water system operates under full line pressure, whereas the main  
tank is at essentially atmospheric pressure. Because of the remote  
possibility of a backflow from the main tank into the public water  
supply, some plumbing codes require a double-walled heat  
exchanger in isolating the collector loop fluid from the potable  
water. An auxiliary heater is provided to ensure an adequate supply  
of domestic hot water at all times.  
For systems using electric auxiliary heating, an electric element is  
typically located about one-third from the tank top, as shown in  
Figure 13.93, and the reentry line from the collector issues slightly  
below this element. The element thermostat is typically set at  
about 135°F to keep the upper third of the tank heated. The lower  
two-thirds of the tank is reserved for solar, and if solar input is high  
and/or demand is low, the auxiliary element remains off and  
demand is met entirely by solar. For the case where gas is the  
auxiliary, it is necessary to use a two-tank design, wherein the gas  
heats a small tank and a second tank is heated by solar; and this  
serves as a preheat for the supply water to the gas water heater.  
Scaling due to calcium carbonate or silica in some waters may be  
a serious problem. In such cases, a conventional closed loop  
system \(Figure 13.93\) can be used; but rather than the external  
heat exchanger, better options are a wraparound tank heat  
exchanger, a mantle-tank heat exchanger, or heat exchanger coil  
immersed in the tank. The system is simplified because Pump No.  
2 is eliminated. When scaling occurs, it is on the inside of the tank  
wall or outside of the immersed coil, and though it may slightly  
reduce performance, it does not clog and impede flow.

While the solar domestic hot water systems described here are all  
active systems \(i.e., they have pumped fluid circulation\) and have  
the collector located on the roof and the tank below, the integrated  
collector-storage \(ICS\) system is a fairly common design. In such  
systems, the solar storage vessel is typically a horizontal vessel  
integrated with the collector and located at its upper end. Heat is  
transported by natural circulation from the collector to the vessel.  
Some designs are open-loop \(no heat exchanger in the vessel\) and  
others are closed-loop \(a heat exchanger in the vessel\). The vessel  
serves as a preheater to the conventional water heater located in  
the semiconditioned space below. Such designs are very common  
in temperate locations such as Hawaii and South Florida.

It is becoming fairly common for domestic hot water systems to  
incorporate a PV-powered circulation pump in place of the common  
AC-powered pump. The pump operates when the sun shines, elimi-  
nating the differential thermostat; it also circulates water faster  
the higher the solar input, a desirable feature.  
When water is used for the heat transport fluid, freeze protection  
must be provided for essentially all locations within the continental  
United States. The drain-down system shown in Figure 13.92 is a  
fail-safe method to provide such protection, but it has certain dis-  
advantages that, in many applications, make the use of an anti-  
freeze fluid advisable. Figure 13.93 shows a widely used system in  
which water plus ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, or some  
similar antifreeze fluid, is circulated through the collector array by  
Pump No. 1. A double-walled heat exchanger is used to transfer  
the collected heat to the service hot water, which is under full line  
pressure.  
A swimming pool heating application is a low-temperature one  
\(80°F to 90°F\) and, as such, can use a much simpler collector for  
use during the spring through fall months. As noted, the collectors  
are often unglazed with a plastic absorber, and are much less  
expensive than glazed collectors. The pool serves as the storage  
vessel, and the collector pump controls are similar to those  
described previously, except that there is an upper-limit tempera-  
ture control to prevent the pool from overheating.  
There are several means for providing cooling by solar power,  
including absorption cooling, desiccant cooling, and vapor com-  
pression cooling. Most installations have used the absorption or  
desiccant concepts. In general, solar cooling has not seen much  
success. The primary reasons are that these systems require rela-  
tive high-performance collectors and the systems themselves are  
complex, making them generally less cost-effective than space  
heating and domestic hot water applications. Additionally, the  
duration of the cooling season tends to reduce cost-effectiveness  
in many applications. Of course, for commercial applications where  
cooling demand may be year-round, this doesn’t apply.  
During the cooling process, refrigerant \(as in a direct expansion  
evaporator coil in a split-system air-conditioning unit\) absorbs  
heat from the building interior. This heat is absorbed by the refrig-  
erant as it changes from a low-pressure liquid to a vapor. The  
low-pressure refrigerant vapor is then drawn into a package  
compressor and condenser unit, where it is compressed into a high-  
pressure vapor at high temperature. The resulting high- pressure  
refrigerant vapor is discharged into a condenser coil, where it  
gives up the latent heat absorbed in the evaporator and the heat  
added during compression and returns to a high-pressure liquid  
state. This high-pressure liquid is forced through an expansion  
device in which the pressure and temperature are rapidly  
decreased, making it possible for the evaporator to again absorb  
heat from the building.  
A building cooling system moves heat from interior rooms to the  
outdoors. The efficiency of residential air-conditioning equipment is  
indicated by a seasonal energy efficiency rating \(SEER\), a measure  
of heat moved per watt of electrical input energy. The higher the  
SEER, the more efficient and less costly a piece of equipment is to  
operate. Larger cooling system efficiency is indicated by COP \(coef-  
ficient of performance\)—again the higher the COP, the higher the  
efficiency.  
A large quantity of heat is required to boil or evaporate a liquid.  
This latent heat is the key to moving large quantities of heat with a  
small amount of refrigerant. To move heat from an area of low  
temperature to an area of high temperature \(e.g., a building at  
75°F to its surrounding environment at 95°F\), refrigeration equip-  
ment uses a fluid that boils and condenses within a limited range  
of temperatures and operating pressures.

The cooling cycle may be reversed to extract heat from a low-  
temperature source, such as outside air, to heat a building. The  
basic equipment is unchanged, with the exception of the addition of  
a four-way reversing valve and controls that permit the condenser  
and evaporator to exchange functions. A heat pump is more effi-  
cient than electric resistance heating because the only action  
required is to pump the refrigerant from a low-pressure vapor to a  
high-pressure vapor. The efficiency of a heat pump, measured as a  
coefficient of performance \(COP\), is a function of the temperature  
of the heat source.

A large building air-conditioning system typically includes a pack-  
aged water chiller, cooling tower, and one or more air-handling units.  
The arrangement shown in Figure 13.203 offers substantial flexibil-  
ity in equipment location and distribution. Chilled water is generated  
in a chiller \(vapor compression or absorption\) and circulated to air-  
handling units strategically located in the building. Condensing water  
from the chiller is circulated to an exterior cooling tower, where heat  
from the building is rejected to the outside environment. The chiller  
and air handler\(s\) may be located virtually anywhere in the building,  
and the cooling tower at an appropriate exterior location.  
In an absorption cooling cycle, cooling is generated by absorbing  
and desorbing water in a salt solution. Just as common table salt  
absorbs water on a damp day, a strong salt solution \(e.g., lithium  
bromide\) will draw water out of moist air when it is sprayed into an  
enclosed tank \(absorber\). If this moist air is connected to another  
tank that contains water that is evaporating, it will transfer water  
vapor to the absorber tank to replace the water that was drawn  
into the lithium bromide solution. Eventually, this strong lithium  
bromide solution becomes diluted and is pumped into a generator  
tank, where excess water is boiled off. The strong solution is then  
cooled in a heat exchanger and expanded back into the absorber,  
where it can absorb more water. The water that was driven off in  
the generator is passed into a condenser, where it cools, con-  
denses, and is then expanded back into the evaporator.  
The refrigeration effect then draws off the \(low-pressure\) evapora-  
tor at 45°F to 55°F to produce chilled water. The absorption cycle  
accomplishes cooling without compressing a vapor, so it can oper-  
ate with reduced amounts of electricity as long as adequate  
amounts of heat are available for the generator, and cooling for the  
condenser and absorber, and a reduced amount of electricity for  
the solution pumps.  
Because an absorption cooling cycle does not use a mechanical  
compressor, it is quieter and vibrates less than a vapor compres-  
sion chiller. It also uses less electricity for solution pumps than a  
vapor compressor uses to do its work. Absorption refrigeration is  
ozone-friendly and can be configured to operate in systems with  
limited or no electricity \(e.g., recreational vehicles\).

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR-CONDITIONING \(HVAC\)  
Chilled water is the most common medium for transferring heat  
from any type of cooling equipment, such as cooling coils and heat  
exchangers, to some source of refrigeration.  
A chilled water system is a closed-circuit system that recirculates  
water between a mechanical refrigeration water-chilling unit and  
remote cooling equipment, usually operating with water tempera-  
tures in the range between 40ºF and 55ºF. There are six types of  
refrigeration units used in chilled water systems\:  
• Centrifugal chiller, with electric motor or steam turbine drive  
• Reciprocating water chiller, with electric motor drive  
• Rotary-screw chiller, with electric drive  
• Indirect-fired absorption chiller  
• Direct-fired absorption chiller, using fuel oil or gas for firing  
• Scroll chiller  
When a chilled water piping system also is used to circulate hot  
water for winter heating, it is called a dual-temperature water  
system. The design water temperature of chilled water systems  
usually falls in a rather narrow range because of the necessity for  
dehumidification and to avoid a possible freeze-up in the chiller.  
Chilled water supply temperatures usually range from 42ºF to 60ºF  
for normal comfort applications.  
Design flow rates depend on the type of terminal apparatus and  
the supply temperature. In general, a higher temperature rise \(or  
a greater temperature difference between supply and return tem-  
peratures\) reduces the initial cost and the operating cost of the  
distribution system, as well as pumps required, and increases the  
efficiency of the chillers. In a given chilled water system, the selec-  
tion of the design flow rate and the supply temperature, therefore,  
are closely related.  
Although lower chilled water temperatures permit higher rises \(or  
greater temperature difference\), lower chiller efficiencies result.  
Water treatment may be required in chilled water systems to  
control corrosion rate, scaling, or algae growth.  
Layout of piping for chilled water distribution varies greatly  
depending on system capacity, extent of distribution, type of termi-  
nals used, and control scheme to be employed.  
Refrigerants that attack the ozone layer above the earth are being  
phased out and replaced with refrigeration systems that do not  
degrade the ozone layer, such as R-123, R-134A, and ammonia.  
Ozone depletion potential \(ODP\) is a measure of this effect. Concern  
for ODP has expanded the consideration of absorption chillers, both  
indirect \(steam\) and direct-fired types. A related, but independent,  
concern is the effect of refrigerants on climate change. Global  
warming potential \(GWP\) is a measure of this effect. Concern for  
GWP has changed considerations regarding refrigerants.  
Cooling towers reject heat from water used in refrigeration con-  
densers or other heat exchangers. Standard ratings are in tons of  
refrigeration when cooling 3 gal/min per ton from 95ºF to 85ºF  
with ambient air at 78°F wet bulb. Cooling tower design should be  
based on performance at local conditions. Packaged cooling tow-  
ers operate with fans moving air horizontally \(crossflow\) or  
upward \(counterflow\) against water falling and wetting the fill or  
packing to expose maximum water surface to the air. Reduced  
airflow reduces tower performance. Architectural enclosures  
should minimize obstruction to airflow.  
Warm water is distributed at the top of the cooling tower by spray  
nozzles or basins with multiple orifices, and cooled water is col-  
lected in a basin at the bottom and pumped to condensers. Water is  
cooled by evaporating a very small portion. Water droplets may also  
be carried out by the airstream. Minerals and impurities present in  
all water increase concentration as pure water evaporates, so a  
little water is “bled” and chemicals are added to minimize scaling,  
corrosion, or biological fouling of condenser tubes. Towers for criti-  
cal or large systems should be multicell, for maintenance without  
shutdown.  
It is usually desirable to maintain condenser water temperature  
above a predetermined minimum, so return water is partially  
bypassed around the tower through a control valve to maintain  
desired supply water temperature. The required water flow rate  
depends on the refrigeration system used and the available tem-  
perature of the condenser water. Lower condenser water supply  
temperature results in increased refrigeration machine efficiency.  
In a cooling tower system, air is continuously in contact with the  
condenser water. Special consideration is required for chemical  
treatment and allowance for impurities, scale, and corrosion in the  
condenser and piping system.  
Fan, motor, and water-splashing noise may be a nuisance. Fan  
noise is reduced by two-speed motors \(about 8 decibels \[dB\] at  
half speed, 15 percent power, and 60 percent capacity\) and by  
intake and discharge attenuators \(about 12 dB\) with 10 percent  
power increase. Tower noise is louder in line with fan discharge  
and intake than in other directions. Each doubling of distance  
decreases sound pressure level by about 6 dB. Barriers can reflect  
some noise from critical directions. For design purposes\:  
• Locate towers for free air movement.  
• Avoid hot air recirculation, long piping from pumps and condens-  
ers, and inadequate substructures.  
• Locate cooling towers so that noise and water droplet carryover  
and fog at air discharge in cold weather will not be a nuisance.  
• Consider seismic and wind load in anchoring tower to supports;  
towers are usually designed to withstand 30 psf wind load. The  
basin may be heated for winter use.

Provide liberal wall openings on the air inlet side and mount towers  
so that the air outlet is at the top of the enclosure. Consider the  
effect of wind on nearby structures and enclosures to minimize  
recirculation of hot, moist discharge air into the inlet.  
A closed-circuit evaporative cooler and a cooling tower both oper-  
ate on the principle of evaporative cooling, which depends on the  
wet bulb temperature of the air. Closed-circuit evaporative coolers  
are used when contamination of the condenser water by direct  
contact with outdoor air cannot be tolerated; they are available in  
sizes up to 300 tons.  
Evaporative condensers combine the functions of a cooling tower  
and a water-cooling condenser. Latent heat transfer is more effec-  
tive as a means of heat dissipation. This permits a smaller-sized  
unit than an equivalent tonnage air-cooled unit and considerable  
energy savings in fan horsepower.  
Installations can be either within an equipment room with appro-  
priate ducts or ground- or roof-mounted outdoors. Adequate pro-  
tection from freezing must be provided for exterior installations.  
For sizing of condensing units, the manufacturer’s rating is the only  
reliable method of determining unit capacity.  
Multiple evaporative condensers may be connected in parallel, or  
an evaporative condenser may be connected in parallel with a  
shell-and-tube condenser. Proper piping and traps must be  
installed in these cases to prevent unequal loading or overloading.  
The condenser water is circulated inside the tubes of the unit’s  
heat exchanger. Heat flows from the condenser water through the  
heat-exchanger tubes to the spray water outside, which cascades  
downward over the tubes. Air is forced upward through the heat  
exchanger, evaporating a small percentage of the spray water,  
absorbing the latent heat of vaporization, and discharging the heat  
to the atmosphere.  
The remaining water falls to the sump to be recirculated by the pump.  
The water consumed is the amount evaporated plus a small amount  
that is bled off to limit the concentration of impurities in the pan.  
The condenser water circulates through the clean, closed loop of  
the heat exchanger and is never exposed to the air stream or the  
spray water outside the heat-exchanger tubes.  
Electric resistance can be used as a heat source in a variety of  
central heating systems. An electric boiler with an immersion heat-  
ing element can provide hot water for a heating-only system with  
radiator or convector terminal units, or for an all-water or air-  
water HVAC system. An electric furnace, with a heating coil, fan,  
and air filter, can provide warm air for a central all-air HVAC \(or  
heating-only\) system. This type of system is essentially a small-  
capacity version of a single-zone, all-air system. Electric resistance  
elements can also be inserted in ductwork or at terminal boxes to  
provide heating capability in central HVAC systems. Heat pumps  
are another means of heating with electricity.

Warm-air furnace units—using either electric resistance or gas as  
the heat source—are designed primarily for residential, small  
commercial, or classroom heating. Cooling can be added to these  
units by installing a cooling coil downstream from the furnace, with  
refrigerant compressor and condenser located remotely outside  
the building.  
Ductwork from the furnace can be installed above the ceiling or in  
a furred-down soffit. Distribution systems above the ceiling are  
usually the radial type with high wall registers. Ductwork also may  
be installed below living spaces, in a crawl space, or a basement.  
Two- or three-story buildings using similar warm-air furnace and  
cooling-coil combinations are centrally air-conditioned via a vertical  
extension of the branch ductwork through walls and partitions. All  
variations of warm-air heating and cooling systems recirculate air  
within the building envelope, making it crucial to leave adequate return  
air passage opportunities from each space back to the furnace room.

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR-CONDITIONING \(HVAC\)  
Single-zone all-air systems have only one point of control \(one  
thermostat for the system, equals one zone\). The system operates  
with a constant airflow from the air-handling unit and through the  
diffusers, with the thermostat controlling supply air temperature in  
response to load. Any number of diffusers may be provided to meet  
air distribution needs. Numerous air-handling unit configurations  
are available. This type of system may be found in residential,  
retail, and industrial buildings, and in interior \(core\) spaces of  
complex buildings. Multiple systems may be used to provide mul-  
tiple zones.  
The distribution system in central and district HVAC systems con-  
nects primary source elements \(chillers and boilers\) and/or sec-  
ondary source elements \(air-handling units\) to the various zones in  
a building requiring conditioning. Interbuilding distribution in dis-  
trict systems is always via water \(hot or chilled\) or steam.  
Intrabuilding distribution can be via air, water, or \(less commonly\)  
steam. Central system distribution classifications include\: all-air,  
all-water, and air-water.  
In a central all-air system, the heating and refrigerating plants may  
be located in a central mechanical room some distance from the  
conditioned space, or may be provided as packaged units in the  
air-conditioned spaces or on the roof. The air-handling unit is  
designed to mix outdoor and return air as desired; then to filter,  
heat, cool, and humidify the air before it is delivered to conditioned  
spaces. It may also exhaust portions of the return air based on the  
balance between outdoor and return air.  
All air temperature/humidity control functions do not have to occur  
within the air-handling unit. Depending on the specific design crite-  
ria and space conditions, some air temperature/humidity modifica-  
tion components \(such as a reheat coil\) may be remote from the  
air-handling unit.  
Common all-air systems include\: single-duct, constant or variable  
volume airflow; dual duct \(rarely used\); multizone; single-duct with  
powered terminal and either constant or variable volume airflow;  
and a single-duct system with self-contained airflow volume con-  
trols and thermostats in each diffuser in the conditioned space. The  
use of terminal reheat, previously a go-to approach for space  
control, is severely restricted by energy codes.  
Components of a basic all-air system include\:  
• Minimum outside air damper\: Usually two positions.  
• Variable outside air damper\: Closed when only minimum outside  
air is desired \(e.g., when outside air temperature is extremely high  
or low\). Designed to open in response to the capability of outside  
air to contribute to mitigation of a building’s heating or cooling  
needs. Exhaust and return air dampers are controlled to operate  
in accordance with the setting of the variable outside air damper.  
• Preheat coil \(PHC\)\: Required only if the temperature and distri-  
bution of the return air mixture could cause freezing tempera-  
tures within the casing.  
• Air-handling unit \(AHU\)\: May be field- or factory-fabricated. Pitch  
the floor of the AHU casing between components, as required, and  
provide piped floor drains to remove any moisture that develops.  
• Cooling coil\: Cooling coil may be a direct-expansion \(DX\) coil or  
a chilled water coil.  
• Humidifier \(H\)\: May use steam or water as the humidification  
medium.  
• Reheat coil \(RHC\)\: Used in the air-handling unit only when a fixed  
discharge air temperature is to be supplied to all areas served  
by the duct system. If different spaces require varying tempera-  
tures, a separate reheat coil may be placed \(in conformance  
with codes\) in each duct serving a different temperature zone.  
Air terminal control units are a key element of many common HVAC  
systems, including variable-air volume \(VAV\) and dual-duct sys-  
tems. These devices—which regulate airflow volume—are usually  
located adjacent to the zones they serve and require space/volume  
for transitions and connections to the central air distribution net-  
work and to the supply air devices. Terminal boxes should be  
installed in readily accessible locations to permit adjustment and  
maintenance.  
Several HVAC distribution system configurations are commonly  
used in medium to large buildings, including constant-volume sin-  
gle duct, variable-volume single duct, dual duct, and multizone.  
A terminal reheat air distribution system can serve virtually an  
unlimited number of zones. The system meets loads by varying the  
supply air temperature through the diffusers in each zone under  
the control of zone thermostats. The system is very flexible because  
zone control occurs at coils \(electric or hot water\) located near  
the conditioned spaces. A terminal reheat system can provide  
excellent comfort conditions \(by providing constant airflow and  
humidity control\) and simultaneous heating and cooling.  
Unfortunately, the reheat approach wastes substantial energy and  
is generally to be avoided unless the reheat comes from renewable  
energy sources \(waste or reclaimed heat or solar energy\). Terminal  
heating may be combined with variable volume air delivery.

This system provides a constant flow of air to the system zones.  
Zone temperature is maintained by reheating \(as necessary\) the  
constant-supply airflow to each zone. Cooling and dehumidification  
is provided by a cooling coil located in the air-handling unit. Heating  
is provided in the outside air preheat coil and in the reheat coil,  
using hot water from a boiler or electric resistance. Normally, the  
amount of outside air provided corresponds to the ventilation  
required to maintain indoor air quality.  
Winter and summer operation of the system is best understood by  
extracting the system state points from a psychrometric chart.  
Assume summer outdoor conditions of 95°F, 50 percent relative  
humidity \(RH\), with desired space conditions of 78°F and 50 per-  
cent RH; system operation points of 10 percent outside air, cooling  
coil set point of 55°F, and a maximum reheat coil set point of 110°F.  
The preheat coil is assumed to be inactive in the summer, and the  
cooling coil to be inactive in the winter when the mixed air is less  
than 55°F.

not a flexible system. The numerous supply ducts make system

used to provide additional zoning capability.

A constant-volume multizone system provides a constant flow of  
air to the zones served by the system. Zone temperature is main-  
tained by changing the temperature of the zone supply air leaving  
the air-handling unit. Dehumidification is provided by the cooling  
coil. The system shown in Figure 13.111 does not provide humidifi-  
cation, but a dehumidification device can be added just after the  
main heating coil for each zone. Cooling is provided by a direct-  
expansion or chilled water-cooling coil. Heating is provided in the  
outside air preheat coil and in the main heating coil, typically using  
hot water from a boiler \(or electric resistance\). Normally, a fixed  
amount of outside air is provided corresponding to indoor air qual-  
ity needs. Hot and cold air are both always available to each zone.  
Varying amounts of hot and cold air are mixed according to the

tion between air distribution and other services. Dual-duct systems  
may be designed with either a constant- or variable-volume air

handling unit \(under all but full-load conditions\) permits serious  
savings in fan energy compared to other control approaches. VAV  
systems are very flexible and can accommodate changes in space  
usage because zone control occurs at VAV boxes located near the  
conditioned spaces. A VAV system, however, is essentially a cool-  
ing-only system, so some means of space heating must be provided  
\(an independent heating system, such as a hot water baseboard  
radiator; fan-powered or induction terminals with electric or hot  
water heating\). VAV systems can provide excellent comfort with  
good energy efficiency, but air quality issues must be examined  
during system design. Several fan and air supply control options  
are available to minimize system energy use at part loads.  
This system provides a variable flow of air to the zones. The amount  
of air is regulated by control boxes serving each zone that act as  
flow-regulating valves. Static pressure is maintained by varying the  
fan speed. For zone cooling, the temperature in each zone is main-  
tained by changing the supply airflow rate. In the winter, a thermo-  
stat in each zone regulates the reheated airflow to meet the zone  
load. Dehumidification is provided by the cooling coil. Humidification  
is not provided, but can be added by inserting a humidification  
device immediately after the fan. The cooling coil can be either  
direct expansion or chilled water. Electric resistance or hot water  
from a boiler provides heating at the outside air preheat coil and in  
the reheat coils. Normally, a fixed amount of outside air is provided,  
corresponding to the ventilation air appropriate for anticipated  
occupancy levels.  
Winter and summer operation of the system is best understood by  
extracting the system state points from a psychrometric chart.  
Assume summer conditions of 95°F and 50 percent RH outdoors,  
space conditions of 78°F and 50 percent RH, and system operating  
points of 10 percent outside air, cooling coil set point of 55°F, and  
a maximum reheat coil set point of 110°F. The preheat coil is  
assumed to be inactive in the summer.  
• Can provide heating and cooling as needed.  
• Provides average dehumidification.  
• Boiler and chiller can be installed at a central plant.  
• Air-handling unit runs continuously at variable volume, which  
can provide adequate ventilation.  
• Equipment life is long.  
• An economizer can be added to take advantage of free cooling  
during appropriate exterior conditions.  
• Does not require piping into individual zones.

• There is no humidification, so this type of system may produce  
very dry conditions indoors during winter.  
• Requires distribution ductwork to each zone.  
• Volume of air moved by air-handling unit varies, which can result  
in inadequate ventilation if not properly balanced.  
• One main reheat coil for the entire system can result in a very  
cold building in extremely humid climates. Could require humid-  
ity sensor to moderate supply air temperature, to maintain  
humidity at or below 60 percent RH.  
• Use of reheat for dehumidification requires unnecessary heat-  
ing energy in the summer.  
• One main heating coil may cause hot interior zones when inter-  
nal loads require year-round cooling.

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR-CONDITIONING \(HVAC\)  
An air-water system combines the most beneficial characteristics  
of air-based and water-based central distribution systems. The key  
benefit of a water system is reduced volume of distribution compo-  
nents \(pipes versus ducts\) as a result of water’s thermal efficacy.  
The key benefit of an air system is the ability to reliably deliver  
conditioned and filtered outdoor air to spaces as part of the indoor  
air quality mitigation strategy. An air-water system can provide the  
best of both distribution worlds.  
In a central air-water system, the heating and refrigerating plants  
will be located in a mechanical room some distance from the con-  
ditioned spaces. One or more air-handling units will supply tem-  
pered and filtered outdoor air to the spaces. The volume of air  
supplied is typically just what is needed for appropriate air quality  
control.  
Air-water systems involve an air side—usually a constant-volume,  
unzoned system, with air introduced to the spaces via conventional  
diffusers/registers or \(less commonly\) through the water-side  
terminal unit; and a water side, where heating/cooling effect is  
introduced to the spaces via a terminal device \(heat exchanger\).  
The induction system was historically a high-end air-water system;  
it has essentially been replaced by fan-coil systems. Fan-coil units,  
which may be used in both air-water and all-water HVAC systems,  
are a very common terminal device \(available in a wide range of  
configurations\). Radiant panels may serve as the terminal device,  
for both heating and cooling systems; in cooling applications the  
panel is often called a chilled beam.  
The term “dedicated outdoor air system” \(DOAS\) refers to an  
HVAC design approach where control of thermal conditions is dis-  
associated from control of air quality. A separate system provides  
centralized delivery of outdoor air for air quality control. Another  
system \(either air or water\) provides for thermal control. The  
dedicated outdoor air approach removes conflicts that may occur  
between air quality and thermal comfort demands.  
All-water HVAC systems circulate only hot or chilled water to  
spaces. No central air supply is provided. All-water systems may  
use fan coil or radiant panel terminal units as the means of convey-  
ing heating/cooling effect from the water to room air.  
Two-, three-, and four-pipe configurations are used for the water  
distribution network. In a two-pipe system, each terminal unit is  
connected to a single supply pipe and a single return pipe. The  
entire system operates in either cooling or heating mode; the sup-  
ply pipe provides either cold or hot water. This arrangement is  
economical, but not operationally flexible because one space can-  
not be heated while another space is cooled.  
In a four-pipe system, each terminal unit is connected to two sup-  
ply pipes \(one hot, one cold\) and two return pipes \(one hot, one  
cold\). These independent heating and cooling water networks per-  
mit complete flexibility of operation from zone to zone. A four-pipe  
system is more expensive to install than a two-pipe system. A  
three-pipe system is a hybrid arrangement that provides two sup-  
ply pipes to each fan-coil unit \(one hot and one cold\) but only a  
single return pipe. Hot and cold return water streams are mixed  
and returned to the chiller and boiler at some intermediate tem-  
perature. The three-pipe arrangement is seldom used because it is  
difficult to operate properly and is inherently very inefficient.

A fan-coil unit is commonly used as a water-to-air heat exchange  
component of an all-water \(or air-water\) HVAC system. In an all-  
water system, all space-conditioning needs are handled by one or  
more fan-coil units. In an air-water system, the fan-coil units carry  
the majority of space loads, while a separate central air system  
handles ventilation requirements.  
A complete all-water fan-coil system consists of several fan-coil  
units \(one for each thermal zone\), a chiller, an air-cooled con-  
denser or cooling tower, a boiler \(if central heating is required\), a  
piping distribution network, and necessary circulation pumps.  
• No summer/winter changeover is required.  
• This system is simpler than other system options for multiple  
interior-zone buildings.  
• The only ductwork needed—in an air-water configuration—is  
for preconditioned air \(approximately 10 to 20 percent of fan-  
coil air\); cooling of preconditioned air may not be required in  
climates with hot, dry summers.  
Fan-coil units in each zone provide heating or cooling for that zone.  
Each fan-coil unit contains a blower, filter, and heating/cooling coil.  
Chilled water and hot water are simultaneously provided to the fan-  
coil units. Chilled water is provided by a chiller located in a central  
mechanical room and hot water is provided by a boiler \(which is  
often located in the same mechanical room\). The unit fans can either  
operate continuously or turn on and off as needed to satisfy the  
zone thermostat. More expensive units may contain a variable vol-  
ume fan that regulates the airflow depending upon zone loads.  
Each fan-coil unit \(which defines a zone\) is controlled by a thermo-  
stat, which changes the temperature of the supply air to meet  
heating or cooling loads. The temperature of the chilled water and  
hot water supplied to the units may be controlled with an outdoor  
reset thermostat.  
• Four-pipe systems are slightly more expensive to install than  
two-pipe systems.  
• The hot water and chilled water loop must operate when only  
one zone needs heating or cooling.  
• Noise from individual units may be a problem.  
• This system may use more energy than other options because of  
frequent operation of the water loop.  
• Decentralized maintenance of fan-coil units can require addi-  
tional maintenance time.  
• Fan-coil units need a sanitary sewer connection to drain conden-  
sate. These drains can be a maintenance concern.  
• The system has no humidification capability.  
cooling coils. A fixed amount of fresh air to the units is pretem-  
pered to 55°F in a preconditioning unit. Both chilled and hot water  
are provided to carry the loads on the cooling and heating coils.  
Chilled water is provided by a chiller located in a central mechani-  
cal room and hot water is provided by a boiler \(usually located in  
the same mechanical room\). Some single-zone AHUs run continu-  
ously. Better-quality units may have a variable volume fan that  
regulates airflow according to zone loads. The chiller or boiler must  
operate when any single zonal unit requires cooling or heating.  
Each unit is controlled by a zone thermostat that adjusts the  
supply-air temperature to meet heating or cooling loads. The  
preconditioning unit is controlled to maintain 55°F by preheating  
air in the winter and precooling it in the summer. The tempera-  
tures of the chilled water and hot water supplied to the units may  
be controlled with an outdoor reset thermostat.  
• This system can provide heating and cooling as needed.  
• The system offers good dehumidification.  
• The boiler and chiller are installed at a central location.  
• The system operates with minimal distribution ductwork.  
• Zonal air-handling units can be shut down without affecting  
adjacent areas.  
• Chiller efficiency is higher than for individual heat pumps.  
• The boiler and chiller have a long life \(25 years\).  
In a two-pipe dual-temperature system, hot water is circulated  
through the terminal units during cold weather and chilled water is  
circulated during hot weather. The distribution system may be  
divided into macro-zones, each of which is capable of changeover  
from heating to cooling, independent of the other zones.  
• The system provides all-season heating and cooling at each unit.  
• The boiler and chiller are installed at a central location.  
• Chiller efficiency is higher than that of individual heat pumps.  
• A fan-coil unit can be shut down for maintenance without affect-  
ing adjacent areas.  
This section describes HVAC systems commonly found in K–12  
schools and small commercial office buildings.  
Small air-handling units \(AHUs\) provide heating and cooling for  
specific zones. Each AHU has a blower, filter, and heating and  
• The hot water and chilled water loop must run even if only one  
zone needs heating or cooling.  
• The entire system is shut down if the loop fails.  
• The temperature is higher in an air-cooled condenser than a  
water-cooled condenser, making chillers less efficient; but a  
water-cooled condenser \(cooling tower\) needs frequent service  
and water quality checks.  
• This system may require more energy than others because of  
the energy needed to run a four-pipe central loop.  
• The system, as shown in Figure 13.118, has no humidification  
capability.

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR-CONDITIONING \(HVAC\)  
This system provides heating and cooling for individual zones with  
separate heat pumps. Each heat pump unit contains a blower, filter,  
and heating/cooling coil. A fixed amount of fresh air to the units is  
pretempered to 55°F in a preconditioning heat pump unit. Each  
heat pump has its own heat rejection \(or ambient air heat source  
during cold weather\). Emergency electric resistance heating is  
often provided for severe conditions.  
The zone heat pump cycles on and off when the zone thermostat  
calls for heating or cooling. Airflow to the zones also cycles on and  
off according to zone demand. In general, the heat pump that  
preconditions outside air must run continuously to provide ade-  
quate fresh air.  
• Installation, system operation, and maintenance are simple.  
• No mechanical room is required.  
• Ductwork is only required for fresh air.  
• The initial cost is low.  
• This system is well-suited to spaces that require many zones of  
individual temperature control.  
• The noise level of this system is generally high.  
• Maintenance costs are high.  
• Overall efficiencies of individual heat pumps are less than that  
of one large chiller.  
• The system needs electric resistance heating when the outside  
air temperature is below 35°F.  
• Humidity control can be problematic if there is no precondition-  
ing unit and zone heat pumps are oversized.  
• Wall penetration is required for refrigerant lines to and from the  
condenser/evaporator.  
• Equipment life may be relatively short \(typically, 10 years\).  
• The system has no humidification.  
In this system, separate heat pumps provide heating and cooling  
for individual zones. Each heat pump unit has a blower, filter, and  
heating/cooling coil. A fixed amount of fresh air to the units is  
pretempered to 55°F in a preconditioning heat pump unit. The  
system has a heat rejection loop, and each heat pump is connected  
to it with a heat exchanger. The heat rejection loop is maintained  
within a preset temperature range \(e.g., 40°F to 100°F\) using a  
central boiler in the winter and one or more cooling towers in the  
summer. Usually, this type of system does not need emergency  
electric resistance heating for severe conditions. The heat rejec-  
tion loop must operate whenever a heat pump is running. In some  
cases, a variable speed water loop pump can be used, although  
care must be taken to provide adequate flow to keep the heat  
pump heat exchangers from freezing up and/or to avoid heat  
transfer problems in the boiler caused by low flow.  
The zone heat pumps cycle on and off when the zone thermostat  
calls for heating or cooling. Airflow to the zones also cycles on and  
off according to zone demand. In general, to provide an adequate  
source of preconditioned fresh air, the outside air preconditioning  
heat pump must run continuously. An air-cooled condenser can be  
provided for the preconditioning units to allow for the main loop to  
be shut down during unoccupied periods.

This system is similar to the system with heat pumps and packaged  
split system described above. However, in contrast to the water  
loop system with an auxiliary boiler and cooling tower, this water  
loop rejects heat in a series of wells or trenches that establish  
contact with soil temperatures. This heat rejection loop is also  
maintained within a preset temperature range \(e.g., 40°F to 100°F\)  
using the thermal mass of the earth to improve performance.  
Emergency electric resistance heating for severe conditions is not  
required. The ground-coupled heat rejection loop must operate  
when a heat pump is running. A variable speed heat rejection loop  
can be used.  
Zone heat pumps cycle on and off in response to zone thermostat  
calls for heating or cooling. Airflow to the zones also cycles on and  
off to match zone demand. In most cases, the outside air precon-  
ditioning heat pump runs continuously to provide an adequate  
source of preconditioned fresh air. An air-cooled condenser can be  
provided for the preconditioning units to allow for the main loop to  
be shut down during unoccupied periods.  
Advantages and disadvantages, respectively \(unless otherwise  
noted\), that apply to the water loop heat pump systems described  
above include\:  
• They conserve energy by recovering heat from interior zones  
and/or waste heat.  
• They do not require wall penetrations to provide for the rejec-  
tion of heat from air-cooled condensers.  
• Air-cooled preconditioning allows fresh air to be supplied with-  
out running the main loop.  
• The noise level may be lower than that of air-cooled equipment  
because individual condenser fans are eliminated and the com-  
pression ratio is lower.  
• The systems can usually be maintained locally, as specialized  
maintenance technicians are not required for the heat pumps  
\(they may be required for the boiler\).  
• Units have a longer service life than air-cooled heat pumps.  
• The entire system does not shut down when a single zone unit  
fails.  
• Ground-coupled systems normally do not need a boiler and cool-  
ing tower. The size of the mechanical room for the loop pumps  
can be minimized.  
• The lifecycle cost of the two-pipe water loop heat pump with  
packaged split system \(without ground coupling\) compares  
favorably with that of central systems when lifecycle costs are  
considered.  
• In the ground-coupled system, the pipe material and the corro-  
siveness of the local soil and groundwater may affect heat  
transfer and service life.  
• In the ground-coupled system, a large area is needed in which  
to drill wells or dig trenches.  
• Zone heat pumps and preconditioning heat pumps need a sani-  
tary sewer connection to drain condensate. These drains can be  
a maintenance concern.  
\(coil\). A reheat coil can be provided for locations with extremely  
humid conditions. A preheat coil can be provided for extreme win-  
ter conditions. The temperature of the chilled water and hot water  
supplied to the units may be controlled with an outdoor reset  
thermostat.

• The initial cost for these systems may be higher than for  
systems that use multiple unitary HVAC equipment.  
• Cleanliness of the piping loop must be maintained.  
• The cooling tower needs frequent service and water quality  
checks \(this does not usually apply to the ground-coupled  
system\).  
• If air-cooled preconditioning is not used, the loop must run  
24 hours/day when any zone needs cooling or heating.  
• The entire system shuts down when the loop fails.  
• More maintenance will be required than for some other systems  
since the heat-pump equipment and air-handling units are  
decentralized.  
• These systems have no humidification.  
• In the ground-coupled system, soil type, moisture content, com-  
position, density, and uniformity affect the success of the heat  
exchange.  
Multizone air-handling units \(AHUs\) provide heating and cooling for  
several zones \(typically between 4 and 10 per AHU\). Each AHU  
contains a blower, filter, heating coil, cooling coil, and bypass  
dampers. Chilled water and hot water are simultaneously provided  
to the cooling and heating coils. Chilled water is provided by a  
chiller and hot water is provided by a boiler. The multizone units  
operate continuously. The chiller or boiler must operate when any  
unit \(including the preconditioning unit\) requires heating or cool-  
ing. Variable volume fans may be used to regulate airflow accord-  
ing to the zone loads.  
Each zone is controlled by a zone thermostat that changes the  
temperature of the supply air to meet heating or cooling loads. The  
supply air temperature is controlled by an arrangement of damp-  
ers that allows air either to flow across or to bypass the cold deck  
• The system supplies several zones from centrally located AHUs.  
• No pipes that could leak are required in occupied zones.  
• The system can provide heating and cooling as needed.  
• The boiler and the chiller are centrally located.  
• Chiller efficiency is often higher than that of individual heat pumps.  
• The system offers good dehumidification. Much of the year, this  
can be provided with the cooling coil bypass damper.  
• The hot water and chilled water loop must run even when only  
one zone needs heating or cooling.  
• The chiller and boiler require service by specially trained  
technicians.  
• A cooling tower needs frequent service and water quality  
checks.  
• Additional space is required for distribution ductwork \(since  
each zone requires a separate duct\).  
• The system has no humidification.

Ducts must be permanent, rigid, nonbuckling, and nonrattling.  
Joints in ducts should be airtight. Steel or aluminum sheets are the  
most common materials used in the construction of ducts, which  
are generally round, flat, oval, or rectangular in cross section.  
Supply ducts should be constructed entirely of noncombustible  
material in commercial construction. Single-family residential  
ducts need not meet this requirement, with the exception of the  
first 3 ft. from the unit, provided they are used in conjunction with  
listed heating units, are properly constructed from a base material  
of metal or mineral, and are properly applied. Ducts passing  
through unconditioned spaces or located in exposed walls should  
have 1 to 2 in. of insulation.  
Ducts must be securely supported by metal hangers, straps, lugs,  
or brackets. No nails should be driven through duct walls, and no  
unnecessary holes should be cut in them.  
Underfloor air distribution \(UFAD\) may be considered as a desir-  
able delivery approach. This system uses an underfloor plenum and  
floor-mounted diffusers. Proponents argue that indoor air quality  
and thermal comfort are improved by a floor-level delivery.  
Diffusers, registers, and grilles are components of an air-based  
delivery system. These devices ensure that air is supplied to and  
returned from a space in a manner that is effective, thermally and  
acoustically comfortable, and aesthetically acceptable \(if not  
pleasing\). A diffuser is a fairly sophisticated air delivery device,  
which should \(in conjunction with ductwork layout\) provide control  
over supply air volume, direction, throw, velocity, and sound power.  
The objective is to deliver air into a space with adequate mixing, no  
drafts, no dumping, and no noise. A register is typically used as a  
less-sophisticated supply air device \(or as a return air device\). A  
grille is basically just a louvered cover \(visual screen\) for a return  
air duct or opening.  
Air supply devices should be selected and located so that they can  
introduce supply air without adverse effects \(drafts, noise\). This  
will influence the number of devices required per room and their  
arrangement in the ceiling. Most diffusers interact with the ceiling  
plane in order to obtain their rated performance characteristics;  
this must be considered in exposed duct applications. Return air  
devices should be located to avoid short-circuiting of room airflows  
and to mitigate noise transfer to/from adjacent spaces. They should  
be installed so that they actually do provide visual screening.  
Diffusers, manufactured of steel or aluminum, are available in a  
wide range of shapes, sizes, surface appearances, finishes, and  
installation detailing. Registers come in a more restricted range of  
shapes and sizes. Grilles are generally square or rectangular in  
shape.  
Fan-coil units may be installed as part of an air-water or all-water  
HVAC system. In an air-water system the fan-coil unit would be  
supplemented with an independent central air supply system \(with  
air-handling units, ductwork, and air-supply devices\) to provide  
ventilation air. Often the quantity of supply air is small enough that  
it can be exhausted without need for a return air system. Although  
fan-coil units can be provided with outside air intakes \(if installed  
at a wall\), adequate control and conditioning of outside airflows in  
such a configuration is problematic.  
A fan-coil air distribution system, either all-water or air-water can  
serve a virtually unlimited number of zones. The system meets  
loads in the various zones by controlling the flow of chilled or hot  
water to the fan-coil unit in response to zone thermostats \(often  
located integral to the fan coil\). Design coordination must address  
the location of units within \(or directly adjacent to\) occupied  
spaces. All-water configurations are not true air-conditioning sys-  
tems, and their use will generally be limited to exterior spaces;  
with a separate central air supply, however, the system can provide  
control of conditions as expected on full air conditioning, and be  
used in both interior and exterior zones.  
An induction unit serves as the room delivery device in an air-water  
HVAC system. This type system can provide a virtually unlimited  
number of zones. The system meets loads in the various zones by  
controlling the flow of chilled or hot water to the induction unit in  
response to zone thermostats \(often located integral to the unit\).  
Air supply from a central conditioning system deals with indoor air  
quality concerns. Design coordination must address the location of  
units within \(or directly adjacent to\) occupied spaces. An induction  
system can provide the control of space conditions expected of an  
“air-conditioning” system. The use of coupled central air and water  
networks attempts to reduce the overall building volume required  
for distribution while providing adequate outdoor air.

Radiant heating systems transfer heat from hot water tubing \(or  
electric cables\) embedded in the floor or ceiling to a surface that  
will then distribute heat to the space. The tubing or cables are laid  
out to maximize heat distribution to the areas of greatest heat loss.  
The choice of hot water or electric heat is made based on installa-  
tion, energy, and total lifecycle costs and code constraints.  
For appropriate applications, properly designed and operated radi-  
ant heating systems will provide greater comfort at lower operat-  
ing costs than other heating systems because of the inherent  
nature of the human body’s thermal functions. About 70 percent of  
the body’s heat exchange is via radiation \(electromagnetic waves\),

In terms of overall system configuration, a radiant floor, wall, or  
ceiling is equivalent to a radiator, convector, or any other terminal-  
heating element. The primary caveat is that a suitable control sys-  
tem must be provided to ensure that floor surface temperatures do  
not rise above 75°F or, if ceiling systems are used, above 120°F.  
Thermostats for radiant systems can generally be set several  
degrees lower for heating than thermostats for other types of  
systems. Finish floor should not be of a thermal insulating material;  
ceramic tile or wood flooring would be suitable.

HVAC controls have historically been of three principal types\:  
electric \(line voltage\), electronic \(low voltage\), and pneumatic.  
Direct digital controls \(DDC\) are the norm today. Wireless controls  
are becoming common. Controls are either manual or automatic;  
although both types may be found in modern buildings, automatic  
controls dominate in all building types and scales. The networked  
interconnection of individual equipment and device controls is the  
norm for most larger buildings. Such interconnection, variously  
called an energy management system \(EMS\), building automation  
system \(BAS\), or building management system \(BMS\), allows for  
sophisticated decision making, fault detection, and performance  
tracking.  
Specific supervisory control applications for EMS include timed  
start/stop, optimum start/stop, demand control, chiller control,  
boiler control, air-handling unit control, and, often, custom controls  
needed to interface to a particular mechanical system.  
Timed controls simply turn equipment on and off at specified times.  
Care needs to be taken to ensure that overcycling of equipment,  
which would lead to a higher equipment failure rate, does not  
occur.  
Optimum start provides additional savings over simple timed func-  
tions and can determine the “on” time for equipment such that the  
indoor conditions meet requirements just before the occupancy  
time. Optimum stop allows the building to “coast” off, typically no  
more than 15 minutes to a half hour before the end of occupancy.  
Applying a variable-speed drive to an air handler enhances these  
controls.  
Demand control minimizes peak demand charges by limiting peaks  
in electrical power use. Utilities have a variety of billing methods,  
including fixed-window, sliding-window, and instantaneous demand  
measures. These billing methods can have different rates and peak  
demand costs for different seasons and time of day. New, evolving  
billing methods include differing versions of real-time pricing  
where the kWh price changes hour by hour. A facility can receive a  
price signal indicating the price for a specified time during the next  
few hours to a day. Prices have ranged from a few cents per kWh  
to over a dollar per kWh in current real-time pricing offerings.  
Demand control programs have the highest level of errors of any  
of the EMS programs, because of the complexity of matching the  
billing methods with an acceptable load-dropping sequence for the  
facility.  
Boiler controls also include sequencing, water temperature, and  
reset controls. Boiler water reset controls adjust the supply water  
to reduce the energy consumption, whenever possible. Before  
applying any controls to either chillers or boilers, make certain that  
all safety controls are operating correctly. Also, with combustion  
boilers, keep the flue gas temperature high enough to inhibit acids  
from condensing out and eroding the flue ducts.  
Automatic fuel-burning equipment requires a control system that  
will provide a prescribed sequence of operating events and will  
take proper corrective action if failure occurs in the equipment or  
its operation. The basic requirements for oil burners, gas burners,  
and coal burners \(stokers\) are the same. The controls can be clas-  
sified as operating controls, limit controls, and interlocks.  
Operating controls initiate the normal starting and stopping of the  
burner in response to the primary sensor acting through appropri-  
ate actuators. Because the heat output of a burner may be widely  
distributed, the location of the primary sensor is important.  
Examples of primary sensors are\:  
• A room thermostat for a residential furnace  
• A pressure-actuated switch for a steam boiler  
• A thermostat for a hot water heater  
An actuator is defined as a device that converts the control system  
signal into a useful function. Actuators generally consist of valves,  
dampers, or relays.  
Ignition for oil or gas burners is achieved by an electric spark or by  
a pilot gas flame, all supervised by a flame safeguard system,  
Energy management and control systems can dramatically reduce  
building energy use and improve occupant comfort and health.  
Primary strategies involve turning the right equipment on/off at  
the correct times, optimizing the operation of HVAC equipment,  
controlling room comfort, and recording HVAC system perfor-  
mance as stored data.  
Most EMS manufacturers offer similar functionality. Their systems  
will have either proprietary or open-systems protocols for inter-  
connectability. Proprietary systems will not usually interface with  
another vendor’s equipment. BACnet, an open system from the  
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning  
Engineers \(ASHRAE\), requires that systems pass certification tests  
to verify that the communications and data formats meet the mini-  
mum interoperability standards. The LonMark open system  
requires vendors using their label to comply with LonMark require-  
ments. Vendors can add features or extensions to the minimum  
requirements; these features may not be interoperable with other  
vendors’ equipment.  
• Local equipment controller \(LEC\)\: The LEC directly connects to  
HVAC equipment, with the controller designed for specific HVAC  
equipment. These controllers work with terminal boxes \(VAV  
boxes and others\), air-handling units, pump and fan motors,  
chillers, boilers, and even non-HVAC devices like access con-  
trols. The controllers usually issue commands to the physical  
controls and communicate upward to building-level controllers.  
Often the equipment controllers will have backup functionality  
so that the facility continues to operate in the event of commu-  
nication failure or a dysfunctional building-level controller.  
Various manufacturers use differing names to refer to these LEC  
panels.  
• Building-level controllers \(BLC\)\: The next level up from the LEC  
is the BLC, which are often called supervisory controllers . The  
BLCs generally use a personal computer with custom software  
to provide direct communication and control of the controllers  
tied to specific equipment. They maintain the equipment control  
schedules, run the building control applications, and store data  
logs containing measurements from sensors and actuators. If a  
local control fails, the BLC alarm sounds, and after the equip-  
ment controller is repaired, the BLC updates the internal sched-  
ules and control strategies in the LEC.  
• Enterprisewide systems \(ES\)\: Enterprisewide systems allow  
communication and control over as large a network as the user  
requires. ES communications typically route to various systems  
using normal Internet protocols. ES software can also enable  
one central location to control and monitor multiple building  
sites.

which must meet legal and insurance underwriters’ requirements.  
After ignition is proved, the flame safeguard system then permits  
the main fuel \(gas or oil\) to enter the burner for on-line combustion.  
Separate limit and operating controls are always recommended.  
Limit controls and interlocks function only when the system  
exceeds prescribed unsafe operating conditions. They actuate  
electric switches that will close the fuel valve in the event of an  
unsafe condition, such as\:  
• Excessive temperature in the combustion chamber or heat  
exchanger  
• Excessive pressure in a boiler or hot water heater  
• Low water level in a boiler and in larger commercial and indus-  
trial burners  
• High or low gas pressure  
• Low oil pressure  
• Low atomizing media pressure  
• Low oil temperature when firing residual fuel oil  
Chiller control typically includes chiller sequencing, water temper-  
ature supervisory controls, and chilled water and condenser water  
reset controls. The selection controls need to be set up to minimize  
the on/off cycling of chillers. The reset controls adjust the water  
setpoints of the chilled and condenser water to optimize the energy  
efficiency of the chiller.  
serious challenge. The same is true for applications with inherently  
high latent loads \(such as dense occupancy spaces\).

Air-handler unit supervisory-type controls include start/stop con-  
trol \(either timed or optimum\), supply air temperature adjustment,  
fan control, and hot and cold deck temperature control. These  
controls also link to the controls on the terminal control “boxes”  
located in the room supply air path. Figure 13.128 shows a typical  
air-handler controller \(a specific-function local equipment control-  
ler\) and its connection to multiple direct-digital controllers \(DDC\).  
The DDCs can interconnect through a variety of communications  
protocols.  
A typical sequence of operation for an air-handling system is as  
follows \(see Figure 13.128\)\:  
1\. When the supply air fan has been turned on but the motor is not  
yet turning, minimum outside air damper D2 and exhaust air  
damper D1 open, the latter to its minimum position to match the  
amount of incoming air. The exhaust air and return air dampers  
are interlocked\: When the exhaust air damper is shut, the return  
air damper is fully open; when the exhaust air damper is fully  
open, the return air damper is minimally open.  
2\. When dampers are in proper open positions, the supply air fan  
starts running and the return air fan is turned on, either manu-  
ally or electrically. This sequence is necessary to prevent the  
supply air fan from sucking air out of the air-handling unit and  
collapsing the casing and to keep the return air fan from blowing  
excess air into the casing and “bursting the bubble.”  
3\. Space thermostat T1 and humidistat H1 control the system. If  
humidification is required, H1 controls the operation of control  
valve V3 at the humidifier in the air-handling unit. If heating is  
required, T1 controls the operation of reheat coil control valve  
V4. If cooling is needed, T1 controls the cooling coil control  
valve V2. At this time, control valves V1, V3, and V4 are closed.  
Control valve V1 for the preheat coil is controlled by a thermo-  
stat on the discharge side of the coil.  
4\. Many control system variations are possible to improve comfort  
and conserve energy. In one commonly used variation, an  
“economizer cycle” is established in which an outdoor thermo-  
stat is added to the control system. This permits the system to  
decide whether T1 should open the heating or cooling coil con-  
trol valve damper to initiate heating or cooling, depending on the  
season, or whether heating or cooling can be accomplished by  
proportionally opening variable outside air damper D3.  
5\. On a balmy spring or autumn day, it may be possible for full  
space conditioning needs to be supplied by fully open outdoor air  
dampers. In this case, damper D1 would be fully open for  
exhaust air and fully closed for return air. D2 and D3 would be  
fully open, and V1 through V4 fully closed.  
A cooling system is typically required to reduce the temperature of  
room air \(called sensible cooling\) while reducing the humidity of  
the air \(called latent cooling—or dehumidification\). A conventional  
HVAC system provides dehumidification by cooling air below its  
dew point temperature, causing condensation on the cooling coil,  
and the removal of water from the supply air stream. This approach  
can cause control problems in typical building spaces because of  
overcooling on the sensible side \(requiring reheating or some other  
air-warming technique to ensure thermal comfort\). In situations  
where the sensible building load is reduced without a proportional  
reduction in the latent building load \(such as an energy-efficient  
building\), providing appropriate dehumidification can become a  
The term “economizer” in this application describes a system  
arrangement that allows for differential flow paths \(for air, water,  
refrigerant\) to be selected so as to provide the lowest cost of  
operation under different load/weather conditions. An air-side  
economizer in an HVAC system is simply an arrangement of duct-  
work, dampers, and controls that allows outdoor air to cool a  
building via the HVAC system when conditions permit. Essentially  
an economizer is a mechanized natural ventilation system.  
Implementing an air-side economizer requires sizing the outdoor air  
intake mixing box and mixing dampers to accommodate more-than-  
minimum airflows. Minimum outdoor airflow is usually that required  
for indoor air quality control. Relief \(exhaust\) air capability must

also be considered. A control system will compare the conditions of  
the return air with those of the outdoor air—and admit more out-  
door air when it has a lower energy content \(for cooling\) than the  
return air; thus reducing energy use for cooling. The comparison can  
be based on temperature difference \(sensible heat\) or enthalpy  
difference \(sensible and latent heat\) depending upon the climate.  
The applicable standard is ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 127, “Method  
of Testing for Rating Computer and Data Processing Room Unitary  
Air Conditioners.”  
Computers generate great quantities of heat in concentrated  
areas. To ensure proper operation, a precise temperature and  
humidity environment is required. The range of control may be as  
narrow as 72°F \(±2°F\) temperature and 50 percent humidity \(±5  
percent\).  
The air-conditioning equipment should be able to meet the chang-  
ing conditions created by relocation of equipment, facility expan-  
sion, and changes in heat output. Hot spots can result if flexibility  
is not built into the system.  
Downflow systems are preferable for a number of reasons. Air is  
returned through the top of the unit and supplied out through the  
bottom into a raised floor, thereby permitting high quantities of air  
without disturbing the occupants. Perforated floor outlets can eas-  
ily be moved, providing flexibility in room layout. The units them-  
selves also form part of the floor grid and can easily be moved.  
Upflow systems are used in areas where there is no raised floor  
\(often the case in retrofit situations\). They are also used in large  
rooms when the air is distributed by a ductwork system. Upflow  
systems are not as flexible as downflow systems for reorganizing  
equipment in a room.  
There are six methods of heat rejection.  
• Self-contained air-cooled\: Uses air within the building return air  
plenum; limited to small-capacity units.  
• External air-cooled\: Uses outdoor condenser unit; refrigerant  
lines generally are limited to 100 ft. above, 30 ft. below, or  
200 ft. total from the computer room to the outdoor unit.  
• Water-cooled\: Uses closed-loop condenser water pumped to an  
external cooling tower to remove heat from the condenser  
within the computer room fan-coil unit. The distance from the  
cooling tower to the computer room can be longer than that in  
an external air-cooled system.  
• Glycol-cooled\: Uses closed-loop glycol to carry rejected heat to  
an external dry cooler or cooling tower, which allows greater  
separation of the computer room from outside air. With addi-  
tional coils, the system can provide “free cooling” during colder  
weather. This system is preferred in areas where ambient air  
temperature is below –10°F.  
• Chilled water\: Chilled water is pumped from a remote chilled  
water plant to a local fan-coil unit.  
• Combination unit\: May use two or more means of heat rejection  
to service the system during certain hours of operation or as a  
backup in case of primary system failure.  
• Exhaust steam and condenser water from steam-turbine-driven  
electric generators and refrigeration units  
• Exhaust air from toilet rooms, mechanical equipment rooms,  
transformer vaults, kitchen range hoods, laundries, laboratory  
hoods, hospital operating rooms, locker rooms, shower rooms,  
and swimming pools  
• Wastewater from washing machines and dishwashers  
• Internal heat gain from lights, people, and appliances  
Applications for waste heat-recovery systems include\:  
• Building space heating  
• Preheating ventilation outdoor air intake  
• Air-conditioning systems supply air reheat  
• Preheating domestic hot water and boiler feed water  
Sensible heat-absorbing aluminum or stainless steel mesh.  
Desiccant impregnated for latent heat transfer. Leakage 4 to 8 per-  
cent between opposing airstreams. Added purging section reduces  
cross-contamination to less than 1 percent. Speed variations or  
face and bypass damper capacity control. Efficiency 70 to 80 per-  
cent. Sizes to 144 in. diameter.  
All systems should be designed with redundancy to provide full,  
continuous cooling. The degree of redundancy should be weighed  
against the consequences of downtime of the equipment. A mini-  
mum of 25 percent redundancy is recommended, but 100 percent  
may be warranted, depending on future expansion and the degree  
of backup required.  
It is difficult and costly to maintain a computer room at a relative  
humidity of 50 percent \(±5 percent\) throughout the year without a  
vapor retarder. In addition, room partitions should extend beyond  
the ceiling to help prevent migration of moisture to and from  
adjoining spaces.  
When planning, it is essential to\:  
• Evaluate the availability of building services and systems,  
mechanical chases, and electrical power capacities.  
• Determine the overall heat load and plan size of the system with  
the client and engineer. Design for built-in redundancy with  
multiple circuits.  
• Use qualified engineers to design and engineer the systems and  
to supervise testing and certification.  
• Detail the construction of walls, ceiling, and floors to provide a  
complete vapor seal and adequate airflow.  
• Evaluate energy-efficiency ratios \(EERs\) of various kinds of  
proposed equipment.  
• Select a system with high reliability and low noise level.  
• Do not ventilate the space when unoccupied.  
Common types of systems include\:  
• Spot coolers\: Direct forced air can be located at ceiling in return  
air plenum or on the floor; short ducting can be used. Capacity\:  
1 to 3.5 tons.  
• Local units for small systems\: Forced air can be used for direct  
spot cooling; it can be ducted or installed in pressurized raised  
floor. Capacity\: 3 to 5 tons.  
• Local units for large systems\: Forced air can be used with pres-  
surized raised-floor installation. Capacity\: 6 to 25 tons.  
• Mainframe cooling systems\: Independently generated chilled  
water is circulated to the computer’s coolant distribution unit  
\(CDU\), an intertwined coiled heat exchanger that distributes  
special coolant directly to the computer in a closed loop system.  
Capacity\: 2.5 to 15 tons.  
• Room design conditions\: temperature 72°F \(±2°F\); relative  
humidity 50 percent \(±5 percent\)  
• Sensible heat ratio\: 0.85–0.98  
• Sensible heat gain\: 115–200 Btu/sq. ft.  
• Total heat gain\: 120–240 Btu/sq. ft.  
• Load density \(SF/ton\)\: 50–100  
• Air quantity \(CFM/ton\)\: 600–900

supply is inadequate to supply fire standpipe and sprinkler sys-  
tems, fire pumps, manufactured and installed specifically for fire-  
suppression systems, are used to increase water pressure. The  
fire pump is installed in strict conformance with NFPA-20.  
The purpose of fire protection is to extinguish or mitigate the  
effects of a fire. Selection of the extinguishing medium most appro-  
priate for a project is based on availability, compatibility, cost, and  
code requirements.  
cooking areas with exhaust ductwork that vents grease. A pow-  
dered chemical is stored in high-pressure cylinders or tanks con-  
nected to a piping system with open heads. Upon detecting heat,  
fire, or smoke at the hazard being protected, a quick-opening valve  
at the storage location opens, allowing the powder to enter the  
piping system and discharge from all of the heads simultaneously.  
Some gas-based systems use inert gases, and others use chemical  
gases.  
Most model, state, and local codes have a separate fire-protection  
section that mandates certain types of fire-suppression systems  
based on occupancy types, potential fire hazards, height, and area  
of the structure. Insurance companies, such as Factory Mutual,  
American Risk Insurers, and American Risk Management, have  
developed design standards to be followed by the clients they  
insure. In addition, the National Fire Protection Association \(NFPA\)  
has developed consensus standards for various suppression sys-  
tems that are referenced by most building codes.  
These systems are used when chemicals that may react to water  
are present or when water will cause unacceptable damage. The  
gases \(generally carbon dioxide or nitrogen\) are discharged either  
The recent shift from animal fats to vegetable fats for cooking  
required a different medium for fighting fires in kitchens. This  
medium is a wet chemical, which operates in the same manner as  
the dry-chemical system.  
A fire-suppression sprinkler system uses water distributed through  
Although the exact nature of fire and the combustion process is  
still not completely understood, it is known that three components  
are necessary for a fire to be maintained\: fuel, oxygen, and a  
temperature high enough to start ignition or maintain combustion.  
All fire-extinguishing methods remove one or all of these compo-  
nents, causing the fire to be extinguished.  
Fires are classified as\:  
• Class A fires, which occur in solid, combustible materials \(such  
as wood and paper\).  
• Class B fires, which occur in combustible liquids \(such as oil and  
gasoline\).  
• Class C fires are electrical in nature \(such as a short circuit that  
causes a spark capable of igniting other substances\).  
• Class D fires occur in metals with their own fuel supply.  
Building occupancy and other specific areas within a building are  
classified as follows, according to the potential for fire\:  
• Light hazard occurs in office buildings, schools, and public  
buildings.  
• Ordinary hazard is similar to warehouses and stores with large  
amounts of combustible material.  
• Extra hazard occurs where there is considerable potential for  
easily started, large fires.  
The term “automatic” is often used when referring to fire-suppres-  
sion systems. In this context, “automatic” means operation of the  
system without human intervention when fire conditions occur.  
directly onto a fire or are used to reduce the oxygen level in a room  
or area to a point below that required to sustain combustion. \(Note,  
however, that this low level will not sustain life.\)  
The gas is stored compressed in high-pressure cylinders or tanks  
and is connected to a piping system with open heads. A quick-  
opening valve at the storage location detects heat, fire, or smoke  
at the hazard being protected, then opens to allow gas to enter the  
piping system and discharge out all of the heads.

to set off an alarm and mitigate the effects of a fire, not necessar-  
ily to extinguish it. When a fire condition is present, the heat of the  
fire melts the element of a closed sprinkler head, allowing water  
to discharge automatically onto the fire.  
The sprinkler piping system is sized using one of two methods\:  
• The schedule method uses pipe sizes based on a minimum avail-  
able water pressure and the number of heads connected to the  
piping, given in NFPA-13.  
• The hydraulic method uses a remote area \(that farthest from  
the water supply source\) based on occupancy type, flow of  
water over the remote area, flow of water at each design point,  
and pressure available in the system.

Three general types of systems are used for suppression and  
extinguishing of fires\: water-based, chemical-based \(either liquid  
or powder\), and gas-based.  
• Water-based fire-suppression systems\: These use either water  
mixed with chemicals, which add fire-extinguishing characteris-  
tics, or undiluted water, to cool the fire below ignition tempera-  
ture or deprive it of oxygen.  
• Gas-based fire extinguishing systems\: These interfere with the  
combustion process and deprive the fire of oxygen.  
• Chemical-based fire extinguishing systems \(either liquid or  
powder\)\: These interfere with the combustion process and  
deprive the fire of oxygen.  
Chemical gases interfere with the combustion process, and chemi-  
cal gas systems are often used to protect computer and electronic  
equipment and areas. The systems operate in the same way as  
inert gas systems, but a lower concentration of gas is usually  
required. Halon is no longer permitted because of environmental  
concerns. Many halon alternatives are available, but authorities  
having jurisdiction must approve their use.  
Because of the force exerted by the discharging gas, hung ceilings  
should be reinforced in areas where heads are located and the  
heads mounted so they can resist the force of discharge.  
The medium most often used to extinguish fires is water. It is read-  
ily available, inexpensive, and easy to apply. The most important  
factor in the use of water-based fire-suppression systems is ade-  
quate water pressure. When pressure from the building water

extensive cleanup after a fire has been extinguished.  
This system is used to protect areas for which water is not a suit-

The major operating components of a sprinkler system are the  
operating valve assembly, piping, and nozzles \(referred to as  
heads for some systems\).  
The operating valve assembly admits water to or sends an alarm  
upon the flow of water in the system. There are many types of  
operating valves; the type of system installed determines the type  
of valve used.  
Heads or nozzles distribute water in a special, predetermined pat-  
tern based on the requirements of the system. They are available  
in a wide variety of configurations, including upright, pendant, or  
sidewall, and can be closed or open. They have different tempera-  
ture ratings to open the head, various orifice diameters for the  
discharge of water, standard or quick response, and standard or  
extended coverage. They can be installed in a hung ceiling as  
concealed, flush, or exposed fixtures.

Occupancy hazard is determined by the quantity and combustibility  
of room contents, the expected heat release rate, the total poten-  
tial for energy release, the height of stockpiles, and the presence  
of flammable/combustible liquids. Occupancy hazard determines  
the appropriate sprinkler head type, protection area per head  
\(affecting spacing\), and sprinkler head flow density. For details,  
refer to NFPA 13, “Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler  
Systems.”  
• Light hazard\: Light \(Low\) hazard occupancies have combustibles  
expected to produce fires with relatively low heat release rates.  
Light hazard areas may include offices, classrooms, and meeting  
rooms.  
• Ordinary hazard\: Ordinary \(Moderate\) hazard occupancies have  
combustibles with low combustibility content and relatively  
moderate heat release rates. Group 1 occupancies may have  
stockpiles not exceeding 8 ft. in height, while Group 2 may have  
stockpiles below 12 ft. Ordinary hazard locations may include  
offices, malls, light manufacturing or research operations, park-  
ing garages, workshops, or maintenance/service areas.  
• Extra hazard\: Extra \(High\) hazard occupancies have contents  
with dust and lint and other materials introducing rapidly devel-  
oping fire with high heat release rates. Group 1 occupancies  
have little to no combustible or flammable liquids, while Group 2  
occupancies may have substantial amounts of combustible liq-  
uids. Shielding of combustibles also comes into consideration in  
determining the extra hazard group. High hazard locations may  
include car repair shops; aircraft and boat servicing; painting,  
dipping, and coating operations; and tank/container storage  
areas.  
Occupancy hazard dramatically affects the required water flow  
density to be provided by a sprinkler system. In essence, it affects  
system sizing.  
Fire is an oxidation \(or combustion\) process that requires three  
distinct elements\: a fuel, oxygen, and heat. These three elements  
are depicted in the “fire triangle” as the necessary ingredients for  
combustion. Remove any one of the three and a fire will be extin-  
guished. Various types of fire prevention and extinguishment  
strategies operate to remove one or more of these ingredients.  
Unimpeded, a fire will typically progress through four stages of  
development. The incipient stage comes first, with products of  
combustion being emitted, but no visible smoke or appreciable  
heat. This is followed by the smoldering stage, with visible smoke  
production, but no heat or flames. The flame stage follows, with  
visible flame but modest heat. The final stage is the heat stage  
where the fire is fully engaged and producing substantial heat.  
In the building context, fires often progress \(unless interrupted by  
fire-protection efforts\) through three phases. A nonexplosive fire  
typically starts as a fire in a room \(such as a trash can fire\). If not  
extinguished but allowed access to additional fuel, a fire in a room  
will progress to the room fire phase—where elements of room  
finishes and furnishings become involved in the fire. If not con-  
tained by fire barriers or a sprinkler system, a room fire will  
spread to other rooms and eventually become a building fire.  
Different fuels create different types of fires and require different  
types of fire-extinguishing agents. Categorizing fires makes it  
easier to choose the most appropriate extinguishing medium \(such  
as water or dry chemical\).  
• Class A—Ordinary Combustibles\: These fuels are involved in the  
most common type of fire, involving materials such as wood,  
rubber, paper, cloth, trash, and some plastics. Class A fires are  
probably the easiest to extinguish as spraying them with water  
will cool the fire, thus removing the heat supply that is essential  
for the fire to burn. Water-based or foam fire extinguishers are  
appropriate for putting out Class A fires.  
• Class B—Flammable Liquids and Gases\: Liquids such as gaso-  
line, petroleum oils, or paints, and flammable gases such as  
propane and butane can fuel Class B fires. A key concern with  
extinguishment is containment of the fuel \(water is a bad agent  
as many of these fuels will float on water and spread\). Foam and  
dry powder fire extinguishers are appropriate for putting out  
Class B fires.  
• Class C—Electrical\: These fires involve energized electrical  
equipment such as motors, transformers, and appliances. Water  
is not an acceptable extinguishing agent due to its electrical  
conductivity. Carbon dioxide and dry powder fire extinguishers  
are recommended.  
• Class D—Combustible Metals\: Metals such as potassium, sodi-  
um, aluminum, and magnesium can burn when in contact with  
air and water. Specially formulated powder-medium fire extin-  
guishers can be effective on type D fires. It is critical that the  
extinguisher match the metal likely to be involved.  
• Class K—Combustible Oil and Grease \(Kitchen\)\: Fires involving  
unsaturated cooking oils are difficult to extinguish due to the  
high temperatures involved. Wet-chemical Class K extinguishers  
contain an extinguishing medium that cools the fire and then  
emulsifies to seal the surface and prevent re-ignition.  
Sprinkler heads come in a variety of styles and performance char-  
acteristics. Selection of heads on a project is based upon architec-  
tural and engineering needs—including appearance, flow rate,  
water distribution pattern, and response time.  
A standard upright sprinkler head is mounted above a sprinkler  
supply pipe, usually in a room without a suspended ceiling and  
where it is desirable to partially protect the sprinkler head by not  
suspending it downward. The head is characterized by a slightly  
curved deflector—a serrated metal plate designed to direct and  
distribute water downward from the sprinkler.  
A standard pendent sprinkler is mounted below the sprinkler sup-  
ply pipe, usually below the surface of a suspended ceiling and is  
characterized by a flat serrated deflector. Concealed pendent  
sprinkler heads, used where clean ceiling aesthetics are impor-  
tant, are recessed into the ceiling plane and covered with a decora-  
tive cap. The cap falls away when temperatures are about 20°F  
below the activation temperature of the sprinkler head. Once the  
sprinkler reaches its rated activation temperature, the head will  
drop below the ceiling and discharge. Flush pendent heads are

similar to concealed heads, but without the cap and with a partial  
projection below the ceiling plane.  
Sidewall sprinkler heads have a deflector designed to ensure that  
the sprinkler discharges water toward the floor surface from a  
wall-mounted position. The deflector directs some water back  
toward the wall so that it is also protected. Sidewall heads are  
used when sprinklers cannot be located in the ceiling \(typically due  
to exposed concrete slab construction\). Room dimensions are lim-  
ited with sidewall sprinklers.  
Dry sprinklers are thermosensitive sprinkler heads designed for use  
in areas subject to freezing. These heads may be used with dry-pipe  
and preaction systems where it is necessary to prevent water or  
condensation from entering the supply nipple before sprinkler  
operation. They can also be used in unheated spaces adjacent to  
heated rooms equipped with wet-pipe sprinkler systems.  
A conventional sprinkler head is activated by heat \(expressed as  
temperature\). The head opens when a triggering action occurs—a  
frangible bulb breaks \(the norm in current head design\) or a fusible  
link melts. This action opens the head and allows water to flow. The  
water flow persists until the water supply is shut off. An activated  
head must be replaced to reset the system.  
Despite their advantages, dry pipe sprinklers have separate main-  
tenance, testing, and installation requirements to ensure proper  
performance. Unlike a wet pipe system, dry sprinklers are free of  
water until a fire is detected, but they need to be periodically  
tested. The challenge with these systems is that once you fill them  
with water during a test, you need to completely drain the system  
upon completion of the test.  
There are six common types of fire-suppression sprinkler systems.  
• Wet-pipe sprinkler systems\: This automatic system uses piping  
filled with water under pressure and closed heads. The operat-  
ing valve assembly, called an alarm check valve , initiates an  
alarm when water flows and prevents the reverse flow of water  
into the building service if the system is supplied with water  
from a fire department connection. When a fire condition exists  
the heat melts \(fuses\) a temperature-sensitive element in the  
head, causing the head to open and water to flow.  
• Dry-pipe sprinkler systems\: This automatic system uses piping  
filled with air under pressure and closed heads. The operating  
valve assembly is called a dry pipe valve . An air compressor is  
required to make up air lost through leakage. Both water and  
compressed air are supplied only up to the dry pipe valve. When  
a head fuses due to a fire condition, it lowers the air pressure,  
opens the valve, and permits water to enter the piping; the  
water then flows only from the open heads.  
• Preaction sprinkler systems\: This automatic system uses closed  
heads and piping filled with air under atmospheric pressure.  
Water is supplied to the operating valve assembly, called a  
preaction valve . An ancillary smoke- or fire-detection system  
initiates a signal upon detection of heat, fire, or smoke. The  
signal causes the preaction valve to open, allowing water to  
enter the piping system. Water will not flow out of the heads  
unless they open due to a fire condition.  
• Deluge fire-suppression sprinkler systems\: Used to protect  
high-hazard areas and specific equipment, this automatic sys-  
tem uses piping filled with air under atmospheric pressure and  
open heads. Water is supplied to the operating valve assembly,  
called a deluge valve . An ancillary smoke- or fire-detection sys-  
tem is required to initiate a signal upon detection of heat, fire,  
or smoke at the hazard being protected. This signal will open the  
deluge valve, admitting water throughout the piping system and  
allowing water to discharge out of all the heads connected to the  
piping network.  
• Antifreeze sprinkler system\: A wet-pipe automatic system is  
filled with an antifreeze solution instead of water to protect  
areas subject to freezing but too small for a dry-pipe system.  
Operations are similar to those of the standard wet-pipe system.  
• Water spray fixed system\: This automatic system uses high-  
pressure water flowing through nozzles designed to discharge  
very small droplets of water directly onto a fire. A water pump  
is required to produce the high system pressure. Water is sup-  
plied to the pump, which is activated by ancillary heat, fire, or  
smoke detectors adjacent to the hazard protected.

Fire-suppression standpipes are a network of water-filled pipes,  
hose valves, and fire hose that allows the direct application of  
water onto a fire. The most common system configuration has hose  
valves only, which are connected to system piping to allow fire  
department personnel to connect their hose to the system. Mains  
are installed in high-fire-rated areas such as stairwells. Hose  
valves are located so that all parts of the building can be reached  
with a 100-ft length of hose and a 20-ft water stream from the hose  
nozzle.  
It is accepted practice to supply sprinkler heads from standpipes  
in various areas throughout a building. Each connection point is  
provided with a flow alarm. A test connection is installed at each  
point to permit authorities to visually verify that the water dis-  
charged from one sprinkler head is actually flowing and will initiate  
an alarm. This test connection is combined with a drain line to  
permit the entire branch to be drained for maintenance and repair.  
A fire department connection \(FDC\) is a means of providing an  
auxiliary water supply for a water-based suppression system—  
including automatic sprinkler systems and standpipe systems. This  
assembly, located outside of the building enclosure, allows the fire  
department to supplement a building’s fire protection water supply  
by connecting hose lines from a pumper truck to the fire depart-  
ment connection. The FDC can also serve as an alternative source  
of water should there be a problem with the primary \(building\)  
water supply. NFPA 13, “Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler  
Systems” requires FDCs in all automatic sprinkler systems.  
An FDC \(also called a Siamese connection\) consists of the fire hose  
connections, a check valve, and piping that connects to the sprin-  
kler or standpipe riser or main. To prevent water from collecting in  
the piping between the check valve and the inlet body, an auto-  
matic drip is installed at the lowest point of the FDC piping. High-  
rise buildings with vertically zoned fire protection risers will have  
a designated FDC for each zone.  
An FDC must be positioned on the street side of the building and be  
fully visible and recognizable from the street or the point of fire  
department vehicle access. The FDC should be positioned such that  
the hose run between the pumper truck and the FDC is no greater  
than 100 ft. FDCs come in various sizes—from 11⁄2 in. for residen-  
tial systems, 21⁄2 in. for most other buildings, and up to 4 to 5 in.  
for very large buildings. The FDC should be no less than 18 in. and  
no more than 48 in. above grade.  
Water-based central fire-protection systems \(standpipes and auto-  
matic sprinklers\) depend upon adequate water supply during the  
duration of an emergency. Initial water supply will be building-  
based; extended water supply may be provided by fire trucks and  
fire department connections. Requirements for a building-based  
water supply are project specific \(involving hazard classification,  
protected floor area, building height, and municipal water supply  
characteristics\). Dedicated fire pumps are often required to pro-  
vide adequate protection. A building-based water supply source  
\(storage\) may be required depending upon project context. See  
NFPA documents for details.

Recommended hose size for use with building fire-suppression  
standpipes should not exceed 1–1/2 in. in diameter and 100 ft. in  
length. A larger hose used by amateurs is likely to tangle and cause  
excessive water damage and possible injuries.  
A connection for a 2–1/2-in. hose should be available to each sta-  
tion for the use of firefighters. Many codes require 2–1/2-in. out-  
lets at all standpipes.  
By using a reducing coupling, a 1–1/2-in. hose can be attached.  
When a 2–1/2-in. stream is required, the coupling may be  
removed. Industrial installations use 2–1/2-in. hoses and train  
personnel in the use of the heavier equipment. Valves may be  
located 5 ft-6 in. above floor \(check local code\).  
Lined synthetic fiber plastic hoses are recommended for use on  
standpipe installations. Cotton-rubber-lined hoses are standard for  
fire department and heavy equipment use.  
If a cabinet containing fire extinguishing equipment \(such as a fire  
hose or a portable fire extinguisher\) is surface mounted there is no  
effect on the fire rating \(if so required\) of the mounting wall. A  
non-fire-rated cabinet may be used. A recessed or semi-recessed  
cabinet installed on a rated wall will, however, affect the fire rating  
of the affected wall. In such circumstances, use of a rated cabinet  
may be a logical design solution \(as opposed to modifying the wall  
construction\).  
The primary difference in rated versus nonrated cabinet dimen-  
sions \(whatever the overall size\) is the addition of roughly 1–1/8  
in. to the required wall opening dimensions to accommodate the  
extra thickness of the rated cabinet walls.  
Portable fire extinguishers can serve as a first line of defense  
against fires of limited size, even property equipped with auto-  
matic sprinklers or other fixed protection equipment. The following  
are criteria for selecting fire extinguishers\:  
• Type and severity \(size, intensity, and speed of travel\) of poten-  
tial fire hazard  
• Environmental conditions of potential fire hazard \(ambient air  
temperature conditions, presence of fumes, etc.\)  
• Effectiveness of extinguisher on potential fire hazard  
• Ease of use  
• Suitability for its environment  
• Any anticipated adverse chemical reactions between the extin-  
guishing agent and the burning materials  
• Any health and operational safety concerns \(exposure of opera-  
tors during fire control efforts\)  
• Training and physical capabilities of available personnel to oper-  
ate extinguisher  
• Upkeep and maintenance requirements

General guidelines for fire extinguishers state that\:  
• Fire extinguishers on accessible routes must be configured so  
that they do not protrude more than 4 in.  
• The authority with jurisdiction over the location dictates the  
number, type, and placement of fire extinguishers and fire-  
extinguisher cabinets.  
• All extinguishers without wheels must be installed on hangers or  
brackets, mounted in cabinets, or set on shelves. Extinguishers  
weighing up to 40 lb. should be no more than 5 ft. above the  
floor. The top of extinguishers with a gross weight greater than  
40 lb. should be no more than 3 ft-6 in. above the floor. All oper-  
able parts must be within accessible-reach ranges.  
It’s also important to note that halon-type extinguishers are no  
longer manufactured as a result of an international environmental  
agreement.  
These standards and classifications are taken from the National  
Fire Protection Association Publication 10, “Portable Fire  
Extinguishers”. Always check local code requirements before  
specifying fire extinguishers.  
The process of locating portable fire extinguishers is influenced by  
several variables, including the type of extinguisher \(fire type\), the  
extinguisher rating \(capacity\), the occupancy hazard, and the size  
of the building. Examples of extinguisher location requirements are  
presented below. See NFPA 10, “Standard for Portable Fire  
Extinguishers” for more detailed information.

Manual fire alarm pull stations generally must be located within  
5 ft. of each exit doorway on a floor. Additionally, they should be  
placed within a building at intervals not greater than 200 ft. apart.  
The design intent is for manual fire alarm pulls to be encountered  
while following an emergency egress path to safety. Manual fire  
alarm pull stations are not required by code if a building is fully  
sprinklered and smoke detection with alarm verification is provid-  
ed. Differential requirements will apply to specific occupancies.  
Fire extinguishers rated for Class B fires are placed a maximum  
travel distance of 50 ft. from the hazard \(smaller rated extinguish-  
ers are placed no more than 30 ft. from the hazard\). Fire extin-  
guishers rated for Class C fires are required in locations with  
energized electrical equipment that would require a nonconducting  
extinguishing medium. For Class D fires, extinguishers are located  
not more than 75 ft. from the Class D hazard.

# ELECTRICAL  
Building electrical systems are designed and installed to provide  
power to building loads. Loads may be hard-wired fixed loads \(such  
as fan, pump, and elevator motors\) or plug loads that access the  
electrical system via convenience receptacles. Building electrical  
systems consist of three main subsystems\: a service subsystem that  
brings power into the building and provides high-level safety and  
control oversight; the loads subsystem that defines the need for  
electricity and the locations of those needs; and the distribution  
subsystem that delivers power from the service to the various points  
of need while providing secondary safety and control functions.  
The design and installation of electrical systems is highly regulated  
by code. Building electrical systems are governed by NFPA 70, “The  
National Electrical Code.” Electrical devices are regulated by  
Underwriters Laboratories \(UL\) listings. Although highly code-  
based, the design of electrical systems should consider that codes  
provide minimum societally acceptable requirements for design—  
an owner’s project expectations may demand more than code  
minimum, particularly in the areas of flexibility in distribution and  
access to receptacles.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
The design of electrical systems is heavily dictated by code  
requirements that have evolved over time to protect the health,  
safety, and welfare of building users and the public. In general,  
these code requirements do not interfere with efforts to make  
buildings more sustainable. Physical sustainability concerns \(as  
distinct from economic and equity considerations\) related to elec-  
trical system design will normally focus on two areas\: \(1\) energy  
efficiency and \(2\) energy conservation. These are conceptually and  
practically different concerns.  
The majority of energy consumed in a modern building passes  
through the building electrical system. This includes energy  
consumed by plug loads, fixed power loads \(motors\), electric light-  
ing systems, and HVAC systems. Domestic hot water and elevator  
loads may also be included. The exception to the electrical pass-  
through pattern is gas-fired equipment.  
Energy Efficiency\: If there is a desire to advance sustainability on  
a project, it would be reasonable to specify high-efficiency electri-  
cal distribution equipment \(such as transformers and switch-  
boards\). A 1⁄2 percent increase in efficiency here affects all power  
in the building \(whereas a 5 percent increase in a motor’s effi-  
ciency affects only the driven equipment\). Consider the operating  
environment for distribution equipment—it can affect efficiency.  
Building wiring should be designed to minimize losses \(via rational  
routing and sizing\). Premium quality motors should be selected to  
improve equipment efficiency.  
Plug loads and electric lighting can account for half the energy  
consumption in commercial/institutional buildings. These must be  
considered in any attempt to improve sustainability. Electric light-  
ing devices have greatly improved over the past decades; very  
efficient lighting equipment options are readily available and  
should be used. In the cooling season \(all year long in many build-  
ings\) heat gain from electric lighting adds to cooling loads in a  
cascading fashion. No building striving for sustainability can be  
designed around business-as-usual plug loads. The design team  
must engage these loads, through dialog with the owner/client, in  
an effort to reduce energy consumption via efficiency.  
Energy Conservation\: As opposed to efficiency \(maximizing output  
per unit of input\), conservation focuses on not using energy. This  
may be accomplished by\:  
• Turning off equipment \(including lighting\) when not needed  
• Using proportional control devices and schemes \(such as vari-  
able frequency drive controllers and dimming ballasts\)  
If the idea of conservation is extended to basic resources, displac-  
ing fossil-fuel energy inputs through the use of renewable energy  
\(solar, wind\) can be effective. Daylighting displaces electricity use;  
solar thermal hot water systems displace gas or electricity.  
Materials Conservation\: This is an area that is not being formally  
pursued for electrical systems in most green building rating sys-  
tems. Yet there is a lot of metal in electrical systems—which may  
already be substantially manufactured using recycled materials.  
Local sourcing of products should be considered \(when possible\) to  
reduce energy and pollution associated with transportation of  
system components.  
Sustainability from a social perspective may be addressed by ensur-  
ing that designs do not sacrifice equitable outcomes for efficiency.  
A transformer changes voltage in an electrical system—typically  
reducing voltage in one or more increments in or adjacent to a  
building. The need for transformers on a project is related to deci-  
sions about utilization voltages and service voltages. Service  
transformers may be located outside of the building envelope or  
inside the building in a suitable room. Distribution transformers  
are often distributed throughout a building in electrical closets.

A secondary unit substation, sometimes called a power center , is  
a close-coupled assembly consisting of three-phase power trans-  
formers, enclosed high-voltage incoming line sections, and  
enclosed secondary low-voltage outgoing sections encompassing  
these electrical ratings\:  
• Transformer kVA\: 112.5 through 2500 \(self-cooled rating\) liquid-  
filled, dry-type, or cast coil  
• Primary voltage\: 2.4 kV thru 34.5 kV  
• Secondary voltage\: 208, 240, 480, or 600 V \(maximum\)  
For information on aisle space, ventilation, servicing area, and  
special building condition requirements, refer to the National  
Electrical Code.  
Four types of starters are described here\: manual single-phase  
starters, magnetic motor starters, magnetic combination starters,  
and solid-state units.  
• Manual single-phase starters are designed to give positive,  
accurate, trouble-free overload protection to single-phase  
motors rated up to 1 HP. Typical applications are fans, machine  
tools, motors, HVAC, and so on. Maximum voltage is 240 V AC.  
• Magnetic motor starters are designed for across-the-line con-  
trol of squirrel cage motors or as primary control for wound  
rotor motors. Starters can be furnished for nonreversing,  
reversing, and two-speed applications. Maximum voltage is 600  
V AC; maximum horsepower is 200 HP.  
• Magnetic combination starters are designed for across-the-line  
control of squirrel cage motors, or as primary control for wound  
rotor motors. In addition, they provide a disconnect means and  
short-circuit protection. They are available for nonreversing or  
reversing applications.  
• A solid-state unit is a reduced voltage motor starter, used to  
reduce starting current and high starting torque. Typical applica-  
tions for controllers are in motors used in cranes, belt-driven  
equipment, conveyors, materials-handling facilities, compres-  
sors, and woodworking equipment. These units are available for  
AC motors in 5 to 900 HP.

made at various points, as in vertical risers in office buildings. Codes  
limit locations in buildings where different types of busways may be  
installed. Consult an electrical engineer before using this system.  
Busway housing may be hung from an overhead support, mounted  
to a wall, or braced to the structure in vertical riser installations.

The general requirements described here for residential electrical  
wiring systems are intended to be used in conjunction with  
Figure 13.149, as the numbers in parentheses following each  
requirement refer to an aspect of the drawing.  
• A minimum of one wall-switch-controlled lighting outlet is  
required in every habitable room, hallway, stairway, attached  
garage, and outdoor entrance. An exception is in habitable  
rooms other than kitchens and bathrooms, where one or more  
receptacles controlled by a wall switch are permitted in lieu of  
lighting outlets. \(1\)  
• In every kitchen, family room, dining room, den, breakfast room,  
living room, parlor, sunroom, bedroom, recreation room, and  
similar rooms, convenience outlets must be installed so that no  
point along the floor line is farther than 12 ft. \(measured hori-  
zontally, from an outlet\), including any wall space 2 ft. or more  
wide, and the wall space occupied by sliding panels in exterior  
walls. \(2\)  
• A minimum of two \#12 wire 20-A small-appliance circuits are  
required to serve only small convenience outlets, including  
refrigeration equipment, in the kitchen, pantry, dining room,  
breakfast room, and family room. Both circuits must extend to  
the kitchen; the other rooms may be served by one or both of  
them. No other convenience outlets may be connected to these  
circuits, except a receptacle installed solely for an electric clock.  
In kitchen and dining areas, convenience outlets must be  
installed at each and every counter space wider than 12 in. \(3\)  
• A minimum of one \#12 wire 20-A circuit must be provided to  
supply the laundry receptacle\(s\), and it may have no other con-  
venience outlets. \(4\)  
• At least one convenience outlet must be installed in the bath-  
room near the basin and must be provided with ground-fault  
circuit-interrupter protection. \(5\)  
• Code requires sufficient 15- and 20-A circuits to supply 3 watts of  
power for every square foot of floor space, not including garage  
and open porch areas. Minimum code suggestion is one circuit  
per 600 sq. ft., but one circuit per 500 sq. ft. is desirable. \(6\)  
• A minimum of one exterior convenience outlet is required \(two  
are desirable\) and must be provided with ground-fault circuit-  
interrupter protection. \(7\)  
• A minimum of one convenience outlet is required in the base-  
ment and garage, in addition to the one in the laundry. In  
attached garages it must be provided with ground-fault circuit-  
interrupter protection. \(8\)  
• Many building codes require a smoke detector in the hallway  
outside bedrooms or above the stairway leading to upper-floor  
bedrooms. \(9\)  
• Disconnect switches are required for equipment. \(10\)

Based on the projected frequency of changes in office furniture  
layouts, a corporate or government organization may elect to  
invest in a permanent raceway system, to minimize cost and dis-  
turbance to occupants when changes or additions are made. When  
structural design dictates the use of metal decking, a cellular floor  
raceway system utilizing trench header ducts is the most likely  
choice.  
Cellular raceways come in a variety of sizes and configurations,  
ranging from 1–1/2 to 3 in. high, with cells 8 or 12 in. o.c., and two  
or three cells per section. An overall floor deck can be full cellular,  
where bottom plates are provided throughout, or blended, as  
shown in Figure 13.156.  
Trench header ducts come in various sizes and configurations. The  
height is adjustable for slab depths above cells of 2–1/2 to 4 in.,  
and widths vary from 9 to 36 in. Cover plates are 1/4-in. thick, with  
lengths from 6 to 36 in., and can either be secured with spring clips  
or flush, flathead bolts.  
Two versions of trench design are available\: One has a compart-  
mental bottom tray with a grommeted access hole for each cell it  
crosses; the other has a bottomless trench duct consisting of side  
rails and a separate wireway in the middle, with grommeted  
access holes only for the power cells.  
When service is needed, the floor is core-drilled above the desired  
cell; the cell top is drilled into, and an afterset insert with above-  
floor fitting is attached. If data and communications wiring can  
occupy the same cell, with power wiring in an adjacent cell, two  
separate service fittings are required for each workstation.  
When it is necessary to eliminate or minimize core drilling, a  
modular pattern of preset service flush outlets can be provided  
along the cellular sections before the floor is poured \(as shown in  
Figure 13.156\). Upon activation, one flush outlet can serve all the  
power, communications, and data requirements of a workstation.  
The modular grid and frequency of preset locations will determine  
the convenience of service provisions for the workstations.

Branch panelboard cabinets are recessed into, or attached flush  
on, a wall; they are accessible for routine service only from the  
front. Panelboards provide a protective fuse or circuit breaker for

• Power panelboards \(also called distribution panels\)  
Panelboards are located to meet the requirements of NFPA 70,  
“National Electrical Code.” In addition, they will be located logically  
relative to the incoming power feed and outgoing circuit layout. In  
larger buildings there will usually be one or more panelboards per

A ground-fault circuit interrupter, or GFCI, is a fast-acting circuit  
breaker designed to shut off electric power to a circuit or recep-  
tacle in the event of a ground fault. GFCIs are required in numer-  
ous locations defined by the National Electrical Code. These are  
locations where a device- or appliance-user might encounter a  
grounding problem in the presence of water \(such as in a bath-  
room, kitchen, garage, laundry room, or on the building exterior,  
including rooftops\). The objective is to reduce the danger of elec-  
trocution. Ground-fault protection can generally be provided  
receptacle-by-receptacle or for an entire circuit. Circuit protection  
is provided by a ground-fault interrupting breaker.

These terms and concepts are commonly used in the field of light-  
ing and branch wiring\:  
• Ballast\: Device providing a controlled electrical current, voltage,  
and waveform to gas-discharge-type lamps. Ballasts provide the  
energy necessary to start lamp operation, and limit the current  
that flows through them during operation afterward.  
Incandescent and halogen incandescent lamps are resistive-  
type sources and do not use ballasts; other lamps such as fluo-  
rescent and high-intensity discharge \(HID\) are gas-discharge  
types and do need ballasts. Low-voltage incandescent and halo-  
gen lamps do use a transformer to provide proper voltage, but  
do not require the level of circuit control provided by ballasts for  
fluorescent and HID lamps.  
• Blackbody\: An idealized radiator of energy that is at a uniform  
temperature and whose emitted color spectrum is the maximum  
that can be emitted by any substance at the same temperature.  
Blackbody radiation is more simply understood as the character-  
istic color spectrum emitted from a perfect radiator at a given  
temperature. Its basic definition is requisite to understanding  
qualitative measures of color rendering.  
• Bulb or Tube\: The glass envelope of a lamp.  
• Color Rendering Index \(CRI \)\: Measure of the color shift in the  
appearance of objects when lit by a light source, as compared to  
being lit by a reference light source of the same color tempera-  
ture. CRI is measured in percentage, with higher numbers being  
closer to color rendering of the reference light source. CRI  
should not be used to compare color rendering between light  
sources of different color temperatures. Even among lamps with  
similar color temperatures, a significant difference takes a 3 to  
5 percentage point margin in CRI.  
• Color Temperature\: A standard of light source color that is also  
referred to as correlated color temperature \(CCT \). This is the  
absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin required for a black-  
body to radiate a color spectrum most similar to that of a given  
light source. As color temperature increases, the general color-  
rendering effect of light sources moves from red \(low color  
temperature\) to blue \(high color temperature\). The human visual  
expectation of what looks natural also varies with intensity\: Dim  
lighting scenes seem more natural in low color temperatures  
\(such as firelight\), whereas bright lighting scenes appear more  
natural in high color temperatures \(such as the blue sky\).  
Standard T8 fluorescent lamps have a CCT of about 4100°K,  
which appears cool. Generically, this temperature is seen as  
desirable in office settings, whereas warmer colored lamps with  
CCT of 3000°K or less are recommended for residences and  
hospitality environments. Natural daylight corresponds to a CCT  
of about 6000°K, an overcast sky to 7000°K, and a blue sky to  
something between 10,000 and 30,000°K.  
• Efficacy \(LPW \)\: Lumens of light output for each watt of electric-  
ity consumed. This is a measure of how efficient a lamp is, but  
not necessarily how efficient a lighting system \(including fix-  
tures and room conditions\) will be. Total system efficacy should  
also include the energy of lamp ballasts in systems other than  
incandescent lighting. Be aware that lumen ratings are much  
like the EPA’s miles-per-gallon ratings on automobiles; that is,  
rated lumens for a lamp are measured under ideal conditions.  
Electrical power, waveform, air temperature, operating position,  
and other conditions are constrained in standard tests so that  
accurate comparison to other lamps can be made on an equal  
basis. The ballast used in testing is an extremely sensitive labo-  
ratory version and typically produces more light from lamps than  
commercially available ballasts do. In most cases, installed  
combinations of lamps and ballasts will not produce as much  
light as the rated lumens, even under initial conditions.  
• Illuminance\: Density of light on a surface, measured as candela  
per square foot or footcandles \(fc \), and represented by the  
symbol “E.” This is analogous to the gallons of water delivered  
on a square foot of lawn. Multiply fc by 10.76 to obtain the  
metric unit, lux.  
• Illumination\: The common term for footcandles of illuminance,  
but also used in a more general sense to describe the means of  
lighting a space. For clarity, when used to refer to footcandle  
levels, the term level of illumination is preferred.  
• Lamp\: Lighting source used in a fixture to generate visible  
energy. Many fixtures use more than one lamp.  
• Luminaire\: Lighting fixture including housing, lamp, ballast, lens,  
reflectors, and louvers or baffles. Some of these components  
are optional or may be part of the lamp.  
• Luminance\: Brightness of light transmitted by, reflected from, or  
transmitted through a surface. Brightness is measured as foot-  
lamberts \(fL \), though that unit of measure is no longer com-  
monly used. Brightness as reflected luminance is the product of  
incident footcandles on a surface multiplied by the percentage  
of visible light reflected from it. Transmitted luminance is, simi-  
larly, the product of incident footcandles on a surface multiplied  
by the percentage of visible light it transmits. The units of lumi-  
nance are cd/ft2  
.  
• Luminous Flux\: Flow of light from a source, measured in lumens  
\(lm \). This is analogous to the flow rate of water through a gar-  
den hose.  
• Luminous Intensity\: Radiant energy emitted by a source, mea-  
sured in candela \(cd \), and represented with the symbol “I.” This  
is analogous to water pressure in a hose.  
Organizations to contact for more information in this subject area

• American National Standards Institute \(ANSI \)\: ANSI publishes  
a system of nomenclature for the designation of lamps, includ-  
ing their electrical characteristics, performance, and physical  
specifications. These designations and specifications help  
ensure interchangeability among different manufacturers’  
lamps and ballasts.  
• Illuminating Engineering Society of North America \(IESNA \)\:  
IESNA is an organization of lighting professionals that provides  
the recognized technical authority on illumination. Its stated  
mission is “to improve the lighted environment by bringing  
together those with lighting knowledge and by translating that  
knowledge into actions that benefit the public.” See www.iesna.  
org/ for more details.

national cooperation and information exchange among member  
countries as a technical, scientific, and cultural organization.  
See www.cie.co.at/cie/home.html for more details.

As in most architectural pursuits, lighting design has both quantita-  
tive and qualitative objectives, such as whether there is enough  
light and whether it is of appropriate character. Lighting design  
also engages both artistic and scientific thinking. Form, texture,  
and space are rendered by a combination of light and shadow.  
Color and composition are also direct artifacts of lighting. The  
methods selected to achieve these results are technical in nature,  
and are the most rapidly changing technology in buildings.  
Technical considerations begin with the following\:  
• Footcandle \(fc\) illuminance levels  
• Lighting efficacy \(lumens per watt, LPW\)  
• Color Rendering Index \(CRI\)  
These three basic factors correspond to having sufficient light,  
using energy-efficient lighting sources, and providing a color spec-  
trum from the light source that is broad enough and balanced  
correctly for the visual task. These three fundamental decisions,  
therefore, require an understanding of the lighting task being  
considered and the means of matching the task to appropriate  
lighting methods.

becomes denser and less elastic, so the human ability to focus  
on objects within 2 ft. is lessened \(presbyopia\). Presbyopia is  
progressive between a person’s age from the 40s through the  
60s. Gradual yellowing of the lens also reduces the amount of  
light entering the eye. At the age of 60, the average healthy  
human eye receives only a third of what a 20-year-old eye does.  
Similar symptoms of aging include loss of acuity in fine details,  
slower accommodation to sudden changes in light level, degra-  
dation of color discrimination, glare caused by lens opacities,  
and a visual field that narrows some 1° to 3° per decade. Some  
of these factors of aging can be offset with additional light, of  
course, but others require high-quality light, proper contrast  
ratios, and considerate design.  
• Enlightened designers and building owners are continually tak-  
ing a broader perspective and lifecycle economics view of light-  
ing. Quality lighting is now more frequently seen as a design  
opportunity and an investment in human productivity and occu-  
pant comfort.  
Lighting accounts for about 35 percent of the electricity use in a  
typical commercial building, about 8 percent in the residential sec-  
tor, and about 10 percent of industrial energy consumption. Relating  
site energy consumption to the inefficiencies of source energy  
production involves a ratio of about 3.3 units of source energy used  
per 1.0 unit of energy consumed. Overall, then, lighting was about  
8 percent of the total primary energy used in the United States in  
2001, and consumed about 22 percent of all U.S. electricity gener-  
ated that year.  
The ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1, “Energy Standard for Buildings  
except Low-Rise Residential Buildings” is part of the Model Energy  
Code. It was published in December 2004 and supplements earlier  
versions. Compliance varies with adoption by state and local jurisdic-  
tions, but all code enforcement agencies are required to develop a  
set of regulations at least as stringent as the 90.1 Model Code. The  
regulation is based on a maximum power budget of allowable watts  
of lighting power per square foot, lineal foot, or individual installa-  
tion. This ratio of watts per square foot is termed the lighting power  
density \(LPD \), or alternately called unit power density \(UPD \) or  
lighting power allowance \(LPA \). Allowable LPD under the Model Code  
is dependent on the building type, occupancy, or area use category.  
Exceptions are provided as appropriate to critical installations.  
lighting results in a uniform distribution of light with reduced shad-  
owing and glare. It is especially well regarded where the work  
surface is predominantly computer screens, so that reflected glare  
from exposed lamps is less likely to be bouncing off the vertical  
visual task surface. Direct downlighting is more efficient than  
indirect lighting because it does not rely on the tactic of bouncing  
light off of multiple room surfaces; but direct lighting is decidedly  
more prone to create glare. Direct-indirect luminaires, which pro-  
vide some balance of both techniques, can also be advantageous  
compromises that capture the best attributes of each.

Daylighting systems only provide energy savings and cooling load  
reductions if artificial lighting is switched or dimmed in proportion  
to received natural light. Photocell-controlled dimming can auto-  
mate this process, but it is also possible to manually switch  
electrical lighting in separate rows parallel to the daylighting  
aperture or window. In either case, electrical lighting should  
generally be considered as supplemental to natural daylight.  
Another form of daylight integration is that of blending daylight  
and electrical light together before they enter the space. Where  
daylighting is used, it is also necessary to provide adequate illu-  
mination for nighttime use.

and recreational spaces

more dynamic controls that automate the operation of lighting and  
allow for the programming and on-demand use of different lighting  
scenes that might be required in a space. There is also an increas-  
ing number of practical ways to conserve energy by way of controls  
that sense the presence of daylight or the absence of occupants.  
Retail and workspaces, where color rendering is  
critical  
Beyond these three basic factors, however, there are a host of  
related lighting design issues and corresponding features of lighting  
systems to incorporate. Each lighting situation will prioritize these  
differently, but following are a few fundamental considerations,  
some of which are discussed in more detail later in this section.  
Glare is to light as noise is to acoustics. Excess brightness ratios  
measured between foreground and background surfaces is defined  
as glare . Direct source glare from lamps is controlled by the cutoff  
angle of the luminaire housing or louvers. Reflected glare is con-  
trolled by limiting the geometry of the cone of light that leaves a  
luminaire and by the absence of glossy or otherwise highly reflec-  
tive task surfaces. Glare from veiling reflections is experienced  
when direct glare from a reflective surface is mixed with diffuse  
reflections from the same surface, such as off a glossy magazine  
page or from a plate of window glass.

The physiology of human vision and the notion of visual comfort  
both influence lighting design in several ways.  
• The healthy human eye can accommodate to different scene  
brightness levels by contracting or expanding the pupil, meaning  
that contrast level is more important in some aspects than is the  
quantitative illumination level.  
• Accommodation is also important in planning for distinctions  
between day and night illuminance levels because occupants are  
accommodated to outdoor brightness levels by day, so higher  
interior illumination levels are needed for their level of adapta-  
tion. Nighttime lighting power levels can, therefore, be consider-  
ably lower. Dimming devices or stepped switching can help  
control lighting levels accordingly.  
• The perceptive sensitivity of the human eye is essentially a loga-  
rithmic response to brightness. Generally, a 50 percent increase  
of brightness level is required to produce a subjective impres-  
sion of one order of magnitude level change in illumination. So,  
for the same lighting situation, the difference between 10 fc and  
15 fc of illuminance is perceptually the same as the change from  
50 fc to 75 fc and 100 fc to 150 fc.  
• Not all brightness is equally perceived. To appear as bright to  
the human eye as 50 fc from a 3500°K fluorescent lamp or a  
2850°K incandescent, a low-pressure sodium lamp would need  
to produce almost 100 fc; a high-pressure sodium lamp would  
likewise need to produce about 90 fc; and a mercury lamp  
around 60 fc. On the other end of the scale, a 6500°K fluorescent  
would produce the same subjective level of illuminance at only  
40 fc; sunlight would be equivalent at 37 fc; and a 7500°K fluo-  
rescent lamp would need only 36 fc.  
• Vision has a pronounced ability to discriminate detail in shadow  
within the narrow cone of foveal vision, as opposed to the wider  
cone of peripheral vision. This means that photographic or vir-  
tual representations of space are never quite the same as a  
direct experience of them.  
• The human aging process decays the eye’s ability to focus and  
even to perceive brightness. With aging, the lens inevitably  
Distribution of light from a bare lamp or a luminaire can basically  
be thought of as having spot, normal, or flood patterns, depending  
on the beam spread. This photometric data is usually indicated in  
the manufacturer’s product data as a candlepower distribution  
curve \(CDC \). The CDC is a polar coordinate plot graphically show-  
ing the candela output from a fixture at any angle relative to one  
fixture axis. The CDC also indicates the cutoff angle or shielding  
angle, above which no light is emitted.  
All energy used to power electrical lighting is instantly converted  
to heat. In conditioned spaces during warm months, this means  
that lighting electricity used inefficiently or excessively is paid for  
twice\: first to power luminaires and then to remove the resulting  
heat by mechanical cooling. Even in cold weather, where waste  
heat from lighting might seem useful for warming the interior, it is  
more economical to provide the same heat with an efficient heating  
system than with what amounts to a very inefficient electrical  
resistance heating system of unneeded electrical light.  
Task lighting and general illumination are often best considered  
and rendered separately. Task light is provided by direct point-to-  
point illumination from a fixture or fixtures onto a single point on a  
surface such as the center of a desk. Ambient light is the uniform  
level of illuminance provided in a room from a uniformly spaced  
grid of fixtures. It is generally wasteful to provide task level illumi-  
nance with ambient lighting if high footcandle levels are needed  
only in a small percentage of the space. Sometimes, however, it is  
acceptable to provide task-level lighting to work surfaces with the  
general illumination system, and then rely on spill light from these  
same fixtures to supply a lower level of background ambient light  
between task surfaces in areas such as circulation paths.  
These factors are interwoven in a number of ways that impact  
lighting economics. First, proper maintenance and lamp replace-  
ment schedules will allow for the design of a smaller lighting sys-  
tem, as compared to a system that is less well maintained. Second,  
this resulting smaller system will cost less initially, and less to  
operate, and may also reduce the size of the cooling system that  
must be installed and operated to offset the waste heat of light.  
Indirect lighting comes from suspended luminaires that radiate 90  
to 100 percent of their light upward, where it is then reflected  
around the room. Direct lighting fixtures, on the other hand, radi-  
ate 90 to 100 percent of their light down onto the task surface or  
in the general direction of the surface to be illuminated. Indirect  
Different lamp types have characteristic degradation curves. In  
point-to-point task lighting, it is therefore advisable to use average  
lamp lumen ratings rather than new lamp ratings. For ambient  
lighting calculations, LLD is one of several factors that make up the  
overall light loss factor \(LLF\) used to predict the average main-  
tained level of light over the operation of the system. In either  
case, it is important to understand that the lighting level attained  
in a new system is not the same as the average operating condi-  
tions of the system.

Most lamp types will undergo some shift in color temperature over  
their life of operation. There is also some variation in actual color  
temperature among a random sample of any one given lamp product.  
The architect is in the best position to integrate light sources  
within a building’s structure. If a lighting consultant or designer is  
part of a design team, it is the lighting designer’s task to assist the  
architect by recommending the appropriate luminaires to manifest  
the architect’s luminous image. It is also the lighting designer’s  
task to refine the positioning of the luminaires for maximum com-  
fort and efficiency in revealing structure and space and providing  
appropriate task lighting for activities within the space.  
The lighting design process follows a path similar to that of archi-  
tectural design\:  
• Programming  
• Schematic design  
• Design development  
• Construction documents  
• Construction procurement  
• Construction administration  
Lighting design can also include the additional finishing steps of final  
adjustment of adjustable luminaries and the programming of light-  
ing controls after final client move-in and occupation of the space.  
The lighting designer should start this process by meeting with the  
client/owner to determine the functional and aesthetic require-  
ments of the end user of the project. The list should include the  
overall image \(preferences and impressions\) desired by the owner  
and design team, as well as the different tasks that are to be per-  
formed within the project’s scope. As a result of this exercise, the  
designer will be able to order the priorities of initial cost, lifecycle  
cost, energy use, visual comfort, and aesthetics. The exercise  
should also educate the client about the lighting design possibilities.  
Designers have many options in considering how lighting design  
influences a space\:  
• Effect\: Spot lighting, floodlighting, backlighting, footlighting, and  
other dramatic or theatrical effects  
• Composition of the lighting scene\: Focus, balance, sequence,  
and so forth, as rendered by patterns of brightness and shadow  
• Glitter and sparkle\: Small points of light used as visual elements  
without the introduction of source glare  
• Beam play and shadow play as figural elements  
• Fixture hardware as design elements, furniture, or architectural  
hardware  
• Configurations\: Ways in which lighting systems are deployed  
• Task lighting\: Work surfaces, lighting accents, artworks, retail  
displays  
• Ambient lighting\: Background fill light  
• Fixture mounting options\: Surface, recessed, pendant, cove,  
valiance  
• Applications\: General, task, high-bay, display, accent, signage,  
facade, landscape, emergency, security  
• Controls\: Ways in which lighting is regulated to match changing  
requirements  
• Local manual on/off switching  
• Local manual dimming  
• Occupant sensors for automated switching in periodically unoc-  
cupied spaces, especially small offices  
• Multizone dimming and switching for manual selection of preset  
lighting “scenes” as set in a programmable scene controller  
• Photocell for automated on/off operation tied to natural light  
levels  
• Astronomical time clock for automated on/off tied to sunrise/  
sunset and time of day  
size of the lighting system, with some diversity factor, also has a  
direct impact on the size of the required mechanical cooling sys-  
tem. Most importantly, lighting design is usually a direct response  
to furniture arrangement, circulation paths, and other occupant  
use patterns. The luminous zoning of an entire building might be  
organized around the use of daylight, distance from a window,  
unfavorable east and west summer sun, and the distinct qualitative  
and quantitative needs of visual tasks that are performed in differ-  
ent areas.  
A significant performance enhancement is achieved by the use of  
air-handling light fixtures. Fluorescent fixtures are commonly avail-  
able as either air-handling or static devices. When used as return-  
air devices, these air-handling fixtures remove some of the waste  
heat from the fixture before it ever becomes part of the room load,  
thus reducing the amount of cooling air needed to flush the room.  
This also keeps the lamp cooler and operating more efficaciously,  
makes it less prone to dust accumulation, and provides an extend-  
ed lamp life. Air-handling fluorescent fixtures are estimated to  
have a 10 percent greater system efficiency than static fixtures,  
meaning that the standard static luminaire will, on average, pro-  
vide 10 percent less light-level output across its lifetime than an  
identically configured and maintained air-handling fixture.  
Consequently, the two systems would provide the same initial  
footcandle levels when they were new, but the air-handling system  
could be sized at 10 percent fewer fixtures to provide the same  
level of maintained illumination.  
foreseeable future. Color, efficacy, control, and lamp life are the  
primary measures of lighting technology, and these continue to  
advance with every product catalog published. The shelf life of  
printed technical data and product information on lighting is now  
so short that all but the most current is open to question.  
Moreover, the voluminous new information being published is dif-  
ficult to catalog, digest, evaluate, and use. Written guidelines  
should, therefore, convey something of the dynamic advances and  
dramatic changes that can be expected to continue, rather than  
offering up a static picture of one specific point in time.  
The architect is well advised to keep in mind how fluid this industry  
is and to carefully consider the most current available information  
for a wide range of current products. Today’s best decisions may  
well be different from other recent ones in this area. It is also  
advisable to use both manufacturer-specific performance data  
\(such as from current catalogs\) and independent evaluations of  
lighting technology \(such as those available from relevant govern-  
ment agencies and the IESNA\). Because competitive product  
ranges often use proprietary terms and labeling information, it may  
also be necessary to consult the appropriate product literature to  
make comparisons with similar products from other suppliers.  
Definitive lighting design standards are difficult to establish.  
Continual advances in lighting technology and the consequent rapid  
updating of lighting products are likely to make this so for the

For estimating lighting from one or more fixtures directly onto the  
center of a visual task area such as the middle of a desktop, use  
the inverse square law\:  
\(candela of source\) ÷ \(distance from source to task\)2 × cos  
\(incidence angle between ray of light from luminaire and line  
extending normal from task surface\), or fc = cd/d2 × cos\(θ\)  
Note that the candela output from a luminaire varies according to  
its candlepower distribution curve \(CDC\) and the aiming angle of  
the fixture. Lighting of one task point from multiple luminaires is  
simply the sum of the individual fc levels provided by each fixture.  
Task-lighting calculations should be made with the understanding  
that the initial output of the fixture and its lamp\(s\) will degrade  
with age and that room surfaces are not considered as light-  
reflecting areas that contribute to illumination on the task.

Any one of these dimensions may be the cavity height \(H\), which is  
the distance from the light fixture to the work plane of interest.  
The lumen or zonal cavity method is used to estimate the main-  
tained levels of uniform illumination from a room of uniformly  
spaced light fixtures. This estimation allows for the contribution of  
reflected light from room surfaces and, thus, considers the room  
itself, along with its geometry and reflectance levels, to be part of  
the lighting system. Maintained illumination is differentiated from  
initial fc levels by including light loss factors \(LLF\) for estimated  
recoverable light loss factors, which include\:  
• Area dirtiness  
• Room surface dirt depreciation  
• Lamp percentage burnout  
• Lamp lumen depreciation  
• Luminaire dirt depreciation  
Unrecoverable light loss factors include\:  
• Luminaire ambient temperature  
• Luminaire voltage  
• Ballast efficiency factor  
• Luminaire surface depreciation  
Light loss factors are the mathematical product of all these differ-  
ent maintenance considerations, each of which can be determined  
by a detailed procedure. LLF usually ranges from 0.6 to 0.8 and can  
be estimated for very preliminary purposes with some knowledge  
of the room conditions and the parameters of lighting system  
operation.  
Light output from luminaires in the lumen method is not taken from  
lamp candela as in the task-lighting method, but rather as the total  
lumens from the fixture multiplied by the efficiency of the fixture.  
This fixture efficiency is termed the coefficient of utilization \(CU\)  
and is determined from manufacturers’ photometric test data as  
published in their product literature.  
Generally\:  
footcandles \(fc\) = \(number of fixtures × lumens per lamp ×  
lamps per fixture × CU × LLF\) ÷  
\(room square feet\)  
If there is only one lamp in each fixture this simplifies to\:  
fc = \(fixtures × lumens × CU × LLF\) ÷  
\(room square feet\)  
If the desired illuminance level is known and the number of fixtures  
is not, then the terms can be rearranged as\:  
\(number of fixtures\) = \(fc × room square feet\) × \(lumens  
per fixture × CU × LLF\)  
Further, to assure uniform illumination at the task, it is necessary  
to check the final fixture layout against the allowable spacing ratio  
given by the manufacturer for the fixture being used. Exceeding the  
spacing ratio will result in gaps between the fixtures where the  
task will not be lit to the predicted average fc level. Note also that  
asymmetric fixtures such as linear fluorescents have two different  
spacing ratios to indicate the beam spread across the fixture  
width, as opposed to along the fixture length.  
Determination of CU is key to this process, and involves a succes-  
sion of calculations based on room geometry, fixture mounting  
height, and room surface reflectances. For very preliminary esti-  
mation purposes and typical room conditions, a CU can usually be  
assumed in the range of 0.5 to 0.8. Note that a CU of 0.6 indicates  
that only 60 percent of the light generated in the fixture will ever  
reach the intended task surface. Coupled with a hypothetical LLF of  
0.7, this means that only 0.6 × 0.7 = 42 percent of the fixture  
output would be effectively utilized and that the average operating  
fc level would only be 70 percent of the illuminance when the sys-  
tem is new. All energy used for light is instantly converted to heat  
in a room, but light that never reaches the task surface is doubly  
problematic. It should be apparent that detailed ambient lighting  
design should never be initiated until CU and LLF values are well  
established. Equally obvious, better maintenance and quality com-  
ponent design results in higher CU and LLF factors that provide the  
same maintained illuminance levels with less wasted lighting  
energy and interior heat gain.  
The relation of efficacy and lighting power density can be used in  
early design stages to estimate maintained uniform footcandles of  
illuminance provided. Relative lighting power density levels for  
different uniform maintained illumination levels and lamp effica-  
cies are shown here for an assumed CU of 0.6 and an LLF of 0.7.  
For other values, use LPD = fc ÷ CU ÷ LLF ÷ LPW. Lighting  
power density is used in comparing relative lighting energy  
requirements and has a specified maximum allowance under the  
Model Energy Code.  
Control of gas discharge lamps during starting and operation  
requires a ballast device. Many fixtures are available with either  
120 V or 277 V ballast options. Higher-voltage fixtures allow for a  
simplified and more economical building electrical distribution  
system with smaller \(lower ampacity\) conductors. Ballasts con-  
sume some 10 to 20 percent as much energy as the lamp they  
control.  
For some 50 years the standard ballast was the wire-wound mag-  
netic type. Electronic ballast technology is now commonplace.  
Electronic ballasts are generally more efficient at operating dis-  
charge lamps and also have lower energy losses associated with  
their own power draw. The more sophisticated electronic ballasts  
also have other advantages\:  
• High-frequency ballasts can be used to drive fluorescent lamps  
at 20,000 Hz or more \(40,000 pulses per second\) and, thus,  
eliminate the eyestrain-causing flicker associated with standard  
60 Hz \(120 pulses per second\) ballasts. This high frequency also  
causes fluorescent lights to operate even more efficaciously  
than standard electronic ballasts.  
• Additionally, electronic ballasts are available in dimmable con-  
figurations to allow for control of stepped or continuously vari-  
able illuminance levels.  
On the downside, electronic ballasts are more heat-sensitive than  
magnetic ballasts. Electronic ballasts are designed for ambient  
temperatures below 105°F with an inside temperature of the bal-  
last of less than 167°F. Magnetic ballasts, on the other hand, have  
a maximum interior temperature of 194°F. Electronic ballasts are  
fitted with thermal protection circuitry that shuts down when over-  
heating occurs, but repeated overheating can lead to ballast failure.  
Another critical factor is that ballast characteristics are tailored to  
a limited number of lamp applications. Mismatched lamp and bal-  
last combinations can result in more than just poor performance;  
it can also cause immediate to near-term catastrophic failure.  
Catastrophic failure can occur because discharge lamps tend to  
have negative electrical impedance once they reach operating  
temperature after start-up, and so a mismatched ballast may  
cause a sudden circuit failure if it is not programmed for the lamp  
in use.  
Dimming electronic ballasts can incorporate low-voltage controls,  
and can be grouped into custom-sized and independently con-  
trolled zones. Low-voltage wiring for this purpose avoids the  
necessity of expensive conduit and is readily modified when use  
patterns change. Low-voltage controls also work with other control  
components such as photocells, occupant sensors, and energy  
management systems.  
This section addresses design considerations for lamps and  
describes different types of lamps.  
Even though color rendering, lamp life, and efficacy ratings will  
normally dictate the general choice among incandescent, fluores-  
cent, and HID lamp families, there remain other detailed factors to  
consider when selecting a specific lamp.  
Smaller light sources are much easier to focus, whereas large  
diffuse sources such as fluorescent tubes are quite difficult to  
direct. The smallest conventional lamp source is the filament of a  
low-voltage halogen MR lamp. With a small filament it is much  
easier to design and build a reflector profile into the lamp bulb or

fixture housing that will produce the desired beam spread, from  
very narrow spot to very wide flood. Small lamps with small fila-  
ments are, thus, usually better suited to task-lighting applications  
where precise control of beam pattern is more important. Larger  
light sources are more appropriate for ambient background illumi-  
nation where light levels are fairly uniform.  
The typical decline of lumen output from a lamp corresponding to  
age in operating hours is termed the lamp lumen depreciation fac-  
tor \(LLD \). LLD is measured as a percent of the original lamp  
lumens and is rated as the percentage of original lumens still  
remaining at 40 percent of the rated life of the lamp. Lamp life in  
turn is established by the number of operating hours at which  
50 percent of a large sample of lamps will burn out completely.  
Because lamps have a variety of expected life hours, the LLD deg-  
radation cannot be compared directly from one lamp to another.  
LLD and lamp life are also influenced by various factors depending  
on the lamp technology being considered; lamp position, operating  
voltage, operating temperature, and hours per on/off operating  
cycle also may have a significant impact. Another productive use of  
dimming is the graduated compensation for lamp lumen deprecia-  
tion, where lamp power is increased over time to compensate for  
lumen depreciation.  
Selecting a lamp also means interpreting their various label desig-  
nations. All lamps have a great deal of information coded into their  
labeling, but different lamp families use different codings. This  
information may variously include the lamp shape, the wattage, the  
base type and size, the lamp tube length in inches, the lamp diam-  
eter in one-eighth-inch increments, the reflector shape, color  
temperature, and the beam spread pattern. An incandescent A-19  
is just the common 2.375-in. diameter lamp. Likewise, an  
F25T8SPX30 is a 25-watt fluorescent lamp with a T-pin base and a  
1-in. diameter bulb operating at a 3000°K color correlated tem-  
perature. A halogen 250PAR38SP designates a 250-watt lamp with  
a parabolic aluminized reflector, a 4.75-in. diameter, and a spot  
beam spread pattern, as opposed to an FL flood pattern.  
Because manufacturers use slightly different coding, and new  
products are constantly being introduced, appropriate technical  
information should always be consulted. Some manufacturers also  
offer a comparison chart of competing product brand equivalencies.  
Examined here are these common types of lamps\:  
• Incandescent  
• Halogen incandescent  
• Fluorescent  
• High-intensity discharge \(HD\)  
• Mercury vapor \(MV\)  
• Metal halide \(MH\)  
• High-pressure sodium \(HPS\)  
• Low-pressure sodium \(LPS\)  
• Induction  
• Light-emitting diode \(LED\)  
Gas-discharge lamps rely on a conductive vapor such as mercury,  
metal halide, or sodium to emit photon energy when subjected to a  
current flowing through the gases held within the lamp bulb or arc  
capsule. In the case of mercury, these photons produce mostly  
invisible ultraviolet energy. As the photons leave the lamp, howev-  
er, they are intercepted by a phosphor coating on the bulb surface,  
where they are absorbed and exchanged for photon energy in the  
visible spectrum. This photon exchange happens very efficiently.  
Different phosphors emit different spectrums of visible light, and  
so the lamp color balance can be tailored to specific applications.  
Halophosphor types are used in warm and cool-white fluorescent  
lamps. Triphosphor blends contain one phosphate each for rein-  
forcing the red, green, and blue portions of the spectrum.  
Halophosphor and triphosphor coatings are combined and tuned in  
the design of lamps to vary color output across the spectrum by  
adjusting the specific type and amount of selected phosphors.  
Halogen lamps have a rated life of about 2000 to 3000 hours with  
a 90 to 95 percent lamp lumen depreciation factor. They offer a CRI  
of 100 at CCTs of 2600°K to 3200°K. The regenerative halogen  
evaporation/cooling cycle necessitates a higher operating tem-  
perature, which slightly increases efficacy and improves the color  
rendering, as well as increasing the CCT. The bulb of halogen lamps  
is usually made of quartz to resist these high internal tempera-  
tures. Note, however, that quartz is very sensitive to oil and dirt, so  
direct handling of the bulb is to be avoided. Premature lamp failure  
can occur if contamination is allowed to deteriorate the quartz  
surface.  
The most impressive advance in incandescent lighting technology  
in many years is that of the halogen infrared reflecting lamp \(HIR\).  
These lamps encapsulate the lamp filament in a quartz capsule,  
which is coated with a multilayered infrared reflecting film. Ninety  
percent of the energy consumed by incandescent lamps is con-  
verted to invisible infrared energy, so the energy reflected from the  
quartz capsule raises the filament temperature without drawing  
extra power. The added incandescence of the HIR lamp filament  
raises its efficacy into the 40 LPW range. HIR lamps are consider-  
ably more expensive than standard incandescent lamps, however,  
and with the advent of low-priced compact fluorescent lamps, HIR  
has a limited popularity.  
Like conventional incandescent lamps, halogen lamps have a small  
filament point source of light that is readily controlled. Halogens  
are also dimmable, just as conventional incandescents are. Halogen  
lighting is most appropriate to applications where precise control  
and ease of dimming are important, such as display and accent  
lighting. But fluorescent and other gas-discharge lamps have a  
higher efficacy, so halogen should normally not be used where  
energy consumption and general room lighting are priorities.  
Halogen multimirror reflecting lamps, labeled MR, are popular low-  
voltage lamps that have a compact filament and precision reflector  
for excellent beam control such as that required for projection  
lamps. MR lamps also have a dichroic coating on a faceted glass  
reflector that allows most infrared energy to pass through the back  
of the lamp but reflects visible light forward through the lens. The  
dichroic filtering gives the projected light a cooler hue and lower  
heat content. Some MR lamps have an infrared reflecting capsule  
around the filament, which increases efficacy. Typically, MR lamps  
are rated by center-of-beam candlepower, rather than initial  
lumens, but MR efficacy is generally around 30 LPW.  
Although the fundamental function of a lamp is to convert electrical  
energy to visible light, lamp construction can also incorporate  
reflectors, lenses, and internal ballasts. These additional features  
allow for the use of less expensive fixtures and more flexible ret-  
rofitting of room lighting.

Many lamp types contain the heavy metal mercury, which is a  
neurotoxin that can impair brain function, fetal health, and child  
development. Compact fluorescent lamps contain as little as 1.4  
milligrams. On the other end of the spectrum, HID stadium lamps  
can contain as much as 225 milligrams. Linear fluorescent lamps  
range from 1.4 to 60 milligrams of mercury. Businesses were  
banned from disposing of lamps that contain mercury in the mid-  
1980s. In January 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  
reclassified these lamps as “universal waste,” a subset of hazard-  
ous waste. This reclassification was intended to simplify the recy-  
cling of said lamps by anyone who handles them in bulk. Most  
states already have their own more stringent and detailed methods  
for dealing with mercury lamps. Each year, however, an estimated  
30,000 lb. of mercury waste still makes its way into the U.S. envi-  
ronment, possibly into the groundwater, and potentially then into  
the food chain. About 1 percent of that mercury is thought to come  
from discarded lamps.  
Designers can mitigate some of this risk by considering the mer-  
cury content of the lamps specified and the expected life of the  
lamp before it needs to be recycled.  
Incandescent lamps generate light by heating a thin tungsten  
metal filament with electrical current. To prevent oxidation, the  
filament is sealed in a bulb of inert gas.  
The typical A-lamp incandescent has a color temperature range  
from 2750 to 3200°K, which is warm and emphasizes reds while  
dulling blue tints. They have a short life of about 750 to 1500 hours,  
but are very inexpensive and easy to replace.  
Because incandescent lamps have a small point source of light  
generated at the filament, effective reflector profiles can be  
designed into a reflective lamp bulb enclosure or into the fixture  
housing. This ease of control translates into a good match of beam  
spread and beam pattern for task and display lighting, because  
light can be put more specifically where it is wanted. Also, because  
the filament works in proportion to electrical current, incandes-  
cents can be readily dimmed. Dimming reduces the efficacy and  
color temperature of incandescent nonhalogen lamps slightly, but  
it does greatly increase lamp life. Solid-state dimmers reduce lamp  
buzz noise, and lamp debuzzing coils \(LDC\) can be added to the  
circuit to reduce filament vibration even further.  
Incandescent lamps come in several sizes and shapes. Their  
generic label takes the form WWSDDBB. Other terms may be used  
for colored lamps, lamp base, or manufacturer-specific features.  
• W\: Watts of power  
• S\: Shape, including general-service A-lamps, reflector lamps,  
elliptical reflectors, PAR \(pressed aluminized reflector\), candle,  
globe, and decorative shapes  
• D\: Diameter of the lamp bulb in eighths of an inch  
• B\: Beam spread characteristic, if applicable\: spot or flood  
Both line-voltage and low-voltage halogen lamps differ from stan-  
dard incandescent lamps in that they use an iodine or bromine gas  
within the bulb to protect against tungsten filament burnout and  
bulb blackening, which contributes to extended lamp life. During  
lamp operation, the halogen gas combines with tungsten that is  
evaporated off of the lamp filament. When the lamp is switched off  
and the gas mixture cools, tungsten is redeposited on the filament  
rather than on the bulb. This effect greatly retards filament weak-  
ening and lamp lumen degradation.  
General fluorescent lamps pass an electrical current through an  
inert and electrically nonconductive gas by first evaporating a small  
drop of mercury held within the tube \(typically, 10 to 23 milligrams\)  
each time the lamp is started. The evaporation is accomplished by  
a high-voltage starting current from the fixture ballast. Once the  
mercury is evaporated and electrical current begins to flow  
through the lamp, a mostly invisible ultraviolet \(UV\) spectrum of  
light is produced. Photons of this UV light are then absorbed by  
special phosphor coatings on the lamp bulb that replaces them very  
efficiently by photons of visible light. The ballast then provides  
reduced current that maintains the discharge of light.  
Although fluorescent lamps do not have the control or color-ren-  
dering capability of incandescents, nor the efficacy of HID lamps,  
they do offer good compromises of efficacy, color, and lamp life at  
a very reasonable first cost. This middle ground of good perfor-  
mance and economy have given fluorescent lamps a strong market  
advantage. Lamp life ranges from 6000 to 30,000 hours at an  
industry standard on/off cycle of 3 hours of operation per start.  
Many fluorescents offer about 20,000 life hours. Color Correlated  
Temperature ratings are available from 2200°K to 7500°K with a  
CRI of 50 to 92 and typical CRI of about 80. Efficacy in some fluo-  
rescents approaches 100 lumens per watt with typical LPW values  
ranging from 75 to 90 LPW. The combination of these factors in any  
single example is highly dependent on the exact lamp and ballast  
combination selected.  
HID technology includes mercury, metal halide, and sodium-gas  
discharge lamps. In general, they have high efficacy and low to  
average color rendering. Their most common applications are

industrial, commercial, roadway, and security lighting. HIDs are  
similar in operation to fluorescent lamps. All of them use a ballast  
to initiate and control a flow of electrical current through a gas-  
filled envelope. The gas emits photon energy when excited, just as  
in fluorescent lamps. Each of the different HID lamp types does,  
however, have individual efficacy, color, and control characteristics  
that make each of them better suited to a particular range of  
applications.  
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, sale of all HID  
technology lamps increased from 20 million units in 1990 to a peak  
of 37 million in 1999, and by 2002 was still near 34 million lamps.  
Despite the continued improvement in some HID lamp efficacy and  
color rendering, however, the relative share of the HID market by  
lamp wattage remained unchanged from 1993 to 2001. The total  
number of HID luminaires shipped has remained constant at about  
12 million since 1996, with outdoor fixtures accounting for about 8  
million, industrial fixtures for 3.5 million, and commercial fixtures  
for some 0.5 million. The only trends in fixture shipments indicate  
a slight increase in the commercial, and a similar small decrease  
in outdoor fixtures.  
HID lamps can be dimmed by either step-level or continuous dim-  
ming ballasts. Dimming HID is important for more than daylight  
harvesting, illuminance flexibility, and energy savings; it also  
avoids the necessity of switching the lamps on and off. Given the  
strike and restrike time needed for HID lamps to warm up before  
reaching or returning to full brightness, dimming can thus help  
extend HID lamp life by maintaining the 10-hour operating cycle for  
which they are designed and rated. Note that the efficacy of an HID  
lamp will decrease when dimmed and that dimming below 50 per-  
cent of the lamp’s rated power may degrade the life, efficacy,  
lumen maintenance, color, and warranty coverage.  
Probe-start and pulse-start MH lamps differ in gas pressure within  
the arc capsule. Pulse-start lamps have improved life \(15,000 to  
30,000 hours\) and lumen maintenance \(as much as a 33 percent  
improvement, from about 65 percent to perhaps 80 percent\), as  
well as higher efficacy \(typically, 90 versus 100 LPW; and varying  
with lamp wattage\).  
Note that metal halide lamp life is rated at a standard 10 hours per  
start. Pulse-start lamps start faster than probe-start metal halides,  
with a strike and restrike time of 1 to 4 minutes and 2 to 8 minutes,  
respectively, compared to probe-start times of 2 to 15 minutes and  
5 to 20 minutes. Pulse-start MH lamps can also be used with elec-  
tronic dimming ballasts to provide variable illuminance control and  
energy savings. These ballasts are also compatible with low-voltage  
control systems for daylight integration and occupancy sensors.  
The addition of ceramic arc tube technology, CMH, in lamps under  
400 watts improves the small lamp metal halide efficacy to about  
90 LPW, with a life of 9000 to 15,000 hours, a CRI approaching 95  
at CCTs of 3000°K to 4200°K, and LLD factors of 80 percent.  
Metal halide lamps are quickly gaining in popularity and their share  
of the HID market has basically doubled since 1991. The  
Department of Energy and the National Electrical Manufacturer’s  
Association estimated that MH lamp sales rose quickly from 5.7  
million in 1990 to 18.1 million in 1999 and then increased more  
slowly to 18.8 million lamps in 2002.  
Induction lighting is a rapidly emerging and revolutionary lighting  
technology. It is essentially fluorescent technology without lamp  
cathodes. Induction lighting provides approximately 100,000 hours  
of lamp life, which is about 10 times the life of HID sources at  
about three times the cost. Efficacy is about 75 LPW, and a charac-  
teristic LLD of 0.70 means less than 30 percent lumen degradation  
after 60,000 hours of operation. Induction also features a CRI of  
80 or better at CCTs of 3000°K or 4000°K. Due to their high cost  
and long life expectancy, induction lighting systems should be  
purchased with a warranty against premature failure.  
Induction lamps resemble general-service incandescent A-lamps,  
but operate like gas-discharge lamps. At the center of the lamp  
itself is an induction coil, which produces a magnetic field and  
excites a mercury electron-ion plasma material on an inner glass  
assembly, producing ultraviolet light. Phosphor coatings on the  
lamp bulb envelope replace the ultraviolet energy photons with  
ones of visible light. Induction lamps have no strike or restrike  
time, no color shift with age, and low sensitivity to operating tem-  
perature. Induction lamps do require special fixtures, are not cur-  
rently dimmable, and may have a pink hue in the first few minutes  
of operation. At the end of the rated 100,000-hours life, it may be  
necessary to replace the entire induction system with its lamp,  
power coupler, and high-frequency generator.  
Clear MV lamps have a very low CRI of approximately 15. Generally,  
even with phosphor coatings the CRI is still low, around 50 at CCTs  
of 3200 to 6700. Efficacy is also limited, to a low 25 to 32 LPW for  
small lamps of less than 100 watts to perhaps 50 to 60 LPW for MV  
lamps of 1000 watts. Efficacy at 40 percent of the lamp life \(LLD\) is  
about 75 percent of the initial efficacy. Lamp life is quite long, with  
24,000 hours being quite common. Brightness and efficacy tend to  
slowly degrade over the life of an MV lamp, but they are known to  
be rugged and durable. Mercury lamps do require a five- to seven-  
minute warm-up strike time and an equal restrike time.  
The bluish cast of uncoated mercury lamps is beneficial to the  
appearance of green vegetation in night scenes. Generally, how-  
ever, mercury lighting has few applications where good vision is  
important. Small MV lamps of around 50 watts contain about 15  
milligrams of mercury, and a 1000-watt MV lamp might contain as  
much as 250 milligrams, so all MV lamps should be recycled and  
treated as hazardous waste.  
Mercury vapor lamps are essentially unchanged since their intro-  
duction in the 1930s. The sole development has been the invention  
of a type B self-ballasted incandescent/mercury hybrid lamp that  
uses a tungsten filament to regulate current in the absence of bal-  
last control. An arc discharge within the B lamp tube generates  
light. Next, a filament is heated to incandescence. Together, the arc  
tube and the filament form a self-regulating series circuit. The  
B-lamp efficacy is comparable to incandescent lamps of the same  
wattage. B-lamps have about a three-minute strike time start-up  
with a five-minute restrike.  
Overall, MV lamps have fallen from popularity because of the  
technical improvements in other lamp families. It is estimated that  
MV lamp shipments fell from 5.5 million units in 1993 to fewer than  
3.0 million in 1999, alone. Projections indicate that this number  
could decrease to less than 1.0 million by 2008.  
HPS lamps discharge an arc current through a small ceramic arc  
tube in the center of the lamp. The arc tube is filled with xenon,  
sodium, and mercury vapor, but the larger outer bulb volume is  
drawn down to vacuum pressure. Efficacy is dependent on the vapor  
pressure of sodium in the arc tube, but 35-watt sources are in the  
range of 65 LPW, 100 watts at 100 LPW, and 1000 watts at 130 LPW.  
Standard HPS life is 24,000 hours with long-life lamps rated up to  
40,000 hours. CCT is normally 2100°K with a very low CRI of 22.  
Higher color-rendering HPS lamps are also available, but their CRI  
of 60 to 85 at CCTs of 2200°K to 2700°K come with reduced efficacy,  
in the range of 50 to 95 LPW. Cold HPS lamps require a three- or  
four-minute strike time and a one- to three-minute restrike time.  
The monochromatic yellow cast of standard HPS restricts its  
usage; thus, although HPS sales have remained relatively steady,  
at around 11.0 million lamps per year since 1994, their HID market  
share has slipped continually since 1991.  
As discussed earlier, as for human factors in lighting design,  
designers are increasingly finding that lower illuminance levels of  
fuller-spectrum light provided by other sources such as metal  
halide are more desirable and actually provide greater visual acu-  
ity than higher illuminance levels with less color rendering. In  
technical terms, at low-light levels, human vision shifts to “scoto-  
pic visibility function,” whereby the spectral distribution and higher  
CCT of metal halide lamps provide better peripheral visibility, even  
at lower footcandles. As long as the reduced lighting level is  
acceptable and compensates for reduced efficacy, this is probably  
a reasonable tradeoff.  
LED lighting uses the semiconductor diode lamps that have been  
around since 1962. Originally, gallium arsenide devices were used  
to produce red light. Developments in new material compounds  
have recently made other colors possible, but single LEDs emit a  
narrow spectrum of color. Combining the relatively wide-bandwidth  
blue gallium nitride LEDs with red and green ones would, in prin-  
ciple, allow for the production of white light. Most full-spectrum  
LEDs in current production, however, use the blue gallium nitride  
LED with a yellow phosphor lens coating.  
LED lamps operate on direct-current voltage and are polarity-sen-  
sitive; improper connection can destroy them. Otherwise, they  
have an extremely long life, typically about 10 years. LEDs usually  
fail by gradual dimming rather than sudden burnout. They are also  
insensitive to vibration and temperature.  
As replacements of incandescent and fluorescent lighting, LEDs  
are termed solid-state lighting \(SSL\) devices and are clustered in  
arrays of several semiconductors to form a single lamp. SSLs cur-  
rently have efficacies of about 32 lumens per watt but are pre-  
dicted to eventually reach 80 LPW.

MH lamps were developed from mercury vapor lamp technology by  
the addition of metal halides to the mercury and argon in the arc  
tube. Continual improvements have made MH technology an excel-  
lent match of color, efficacy, and lamp life. CRIs of 70 to 90 are  
common at CCTs of 2500°K to 5000°K; and lamp efficacies are in  
the range of 75 to 125 LPW.  
Although LPS lamps have very high efficacy, on the order of 100 to  
150 LPW, they have no color rendering capability due to their  
strictly monochromatic light, with a very low CRI at a CCT of  
2000°K. LPS ballasts add another 30 or 40 watts of required sys-  
tem power and reduce the overall system efficacy. The most com-  
mon LPS application might be that of replacement lamps in mer-  
cury vapor fixtures, where replacement wattages of 18 to 180 are  
available and offer life ratings of 16,000 to 18,000 hours, with a  
maintenance factor LLD of 87 percent. There are other environmen-  
tal considerations in favor of LPS, however. First, the narrow  
bandwidth of LPS lamps is easily filtered out by astronomers who  
have increasing night “skyglow” from unshielded lighting to deal  
with; second, some animals such as sea turtles are not as attract-  
ed to these lamps as they are to full-spectrum lamps. Many ani-  
mals are accidentally destroyed when leaving their habitat to  
approach full-spectrum lighting.  
Light fixture performance, as an artifact of industrial design, has  
been greatly augmented by advancements in computer simulation  
and CAD design. The ability to use ray tracing for the design of  
reflectors, for example, and the parallel advent of precision manu-  
facturing makes it possible to devise and craft luminaires that have  
finely controlled photometric performance.  
Luminaires have the following functional components. Some of  
these are optional elements that are not included in every lumi-  
naire, or may be incorporated into the lamp used in the fixture. In  
the case of PAR incandescent lamps, for example \(parabolic alumi-  
nized reflector lamps\), the reflector and a lens are built into the  
reflective lamp bulb enclosure and a Fresnel lens is pressed into  
the lamp aperture.  
• Lamp\: The source of light used to convert supplied energy into  
visible light energy.  
• Reflector\: Interior surface around the lamp used to control the  
spread of light from the fixture or to diffuse it as widely as pos-  
sible. Reflector profiles can be designed for converging or  
diverging patterns of light in parabolic or elliptical shapes. This  
level of control is only possible where a small lighting filament  
is used, such as incandescent lamps have. Larger sources such  
as fluorescent lamps can be diffused easily, but cannot be  
focused. Most reflectors are of white enamel or an aluminized  
surface. Cones of various color and material that are inserted  
into fixtures also fit this function, but cones are often dulled or

darkened to reduce the apparent brightness of the fixture when  
viewed from the side.  
• Lens\: Optical element used to control the direction and diffusion  
of light from the fixture; to protect the lamp from physical dam-  
age, moisture, or weather; and, optionally, to color the light as it  
exits the fixture. Lenses can focus or spread a controlled beam  
or cone of light from the fixture by optical diffraction, and they  
can also diffuse light by having translucent properties or a dif-  
fuse rather than a transparent surface.  
• Louvers and baffles\: Shielding elements used to hide the lamp  
from direct view and/or to diffuse light from the fixture in a wide  
pattern.  
Controls are an essential part of any lighting system. Controls are  
integral to energy conservation—allowing light output \(energy  
consumption\) to match user needs. Controls can also contribute to  
spatial ambiance. Controls can be manual \(requiring explicit user  
action for success\) or automatic \(operable in the absence of user  
action\). Controls can be on/off or dimming—with dimming allow-  
ing for a much wider range of system responses \(other than light/  
no-light\). Current design practices tend toward manual and on/off  
controls in business-as-usual buildings. Automatic and dimming  
controls are common in high-performance buildings \(green; net-  
zero energy\).  
The purposes for which lighting controls are installed include\:  
• Energy use reduction\: Basic manual on/off controls save energy  
if properly used; automatic occupancy sensor on/off controls  
can increase off cycles in public spaces with no clear ownership;  
automatic time switch on/off controls can do the same when the  
need for lighting is driven by daily cycles and not occupancy  
status; task tuning controls can allow illuminance to match  
visual needs in spaces with a range of tasks.  
• Daylight compensation\: Spaces with daylighting will experience  
a range of illuminance values throughout the year as sky lumi-  
nance changes; this type of control adjusts the output of the  
electric lighting system to maintain reasonably constant illumi-  
nance in a space.  
• Lumen maintenance\: Lighting system output decreases with  
time \(as a result of lamp depreciation, dirt collection on reflec-  
tive surfaces, and other factors\); an automatic dimming system  
can reduce light output early in the system lifecycle so that  
spaces are not over-lit \(and energy is conserved\).  
• Scene changes\: Preprogrammed lighting controls can simplify  
switching from one lighting arrangement to another \(such as from  
wall washing to uniform task illuminance in a conference room\).  
• Demand control\: In a building with high demand charges \(dis-  
tinct from energy consumption charges\) this type of control can  
be one part of a demand management system.

Light leaving a site and falling on a neighboring property is termed  
light trespass. From the culprit building perspective, such light is a  
wasted resource—increasing energy consumption and adding  
unnecessarily to carbon emissions. From the neighbor’s perspec-  
tive, trespassing light may decrease quality of life if it enters an  
area the neighbor desires to be dark. The solution to light trespass  
for exterior lighting fixtures is careful selection and installation of  
fixtures with appropriate cutoff characteristics. Light trespass  
caused by interior lighting transmitted through windows is more of  
a challenge to control—but not impossible if deemed important.  
Light illuminating the sky is termed light pollution. As in most cases  
of pollution, the effects of lighting the night sky impinge on the  
enjoyment of others \(and not just adjacent neighbors\). Light pollu-  
tion also wastes energy. The solution to light pollution from exte-  
rior lighting fixtures lies in the selection of fixtures with desirable  
cutoff characteristics. The surfaces being lit by exterior fixtures will  
reflect light, some of which will head toward the sky. This effect can  
be somewhat controlled by selecting moderate exterior surface  
illuminances. Light trespass caused by interior lighting transmitted  
through skylights is more of a challenge to control—involving the  
interaction of interior luminance and glazing transmittance.  
Photovoltaic \(PV\) systems convert sunlight into direct current \(DC\)  
electricity, which can subsequently be “inverted” to AC electricity  
to meet an AC load. Their rapidly decreasing cost and rising con-  
ventional energy costs will likely make these systems competitive  
with conventional sources of electricity within the decade. They are  
currently competitive with many off-grid applications where power  
line extension is costly or use of a diesel generator is undesirable.  
The basic collection component of a PV system is the photovoltaic  
cell, a layered semiconductor that is generally fabricated from crys-  
talline silicon. A group of cells interconnected in series is encapsu-  
lated to form a module. An array is an assembly of modules.  
The most common PV material is crystalline silicon, and currently the  
efficiency of commercial cells/modules is somewhat above 15 per-  
cent. Significant advances are being made in silicon technology and  
it is expected that the efficiency of commercial modules will exceed  
20 percent in the near future. A variety of other PV technologies  
\(including thin films and amorphous materials\) are available, gener-  
ally with somewhat lower efficiencies than current silicon technolo-  
gy. An important parameter for PV is the cost per watt of energy, and  
modules of different efficiencies may have comparable dollars per  
watt. The module efficiency is important to the designer in that the  
installed capacity \(power\) for a given area is directly proportional to  
efficiency.

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES ELECTRICAL  
A major component of a grid-connected PV system is the inverter,  
or power conditioning unit \(PCU\), which converts the DC power  
generated by the PV array into AC power used by the load and  
synchronizes the PV array’s power output to make it compatible  
with the local utility output.  
the battery bank should provide 5 to 10 “days of autonomy”–that is,  
have a capacity to meet the load for that many days.  
PV module installation typically involves one of three forms\:  
• Standoff or rack-mounted away from the roof or walls, and  
either parallel or inclined with the mounting surface. The stand-  
off module design is currently the most common in residential  
applications and has the advantages of allowing convection  
cooling on the back side, ease of installation \(particularly for  
retrofit\), less impact on roof integrity, and ease of service/  
repair.  
• Set directly on the roof sheathing or into the wall and made  
integral with that surface.  
• PV shingles, which may replace conventional roofing. PV shingles  
have lower efficiencies and are currently much less common.  
For commercial/institutional structures in particular, the use of  
building-integrated photovoltaics is becoming rather common. In  
such cases, PV modules may be sufficiently integrated into the roof  
or walls of the structure so that they provide the exterior barrier  
to the elements. Because of this integration of the PV system with  
the building envelope, it is particularly important that the architect  
be intimately involved in the design and specification of such a  
system.  
The most optimal orientation for solar collectors, whether thermal  
or PV, is on a south-sloping structure and inclined approximately at  
the local latitude or at a slightly greater tilt. For space heating  
systems, latitude plus about 15° favors the high winter season  
heating demand. Although these angles are recommended, if  
within even 10° or 15° for either azimuth or tilt, the collector’s  
performance degradation is small. For locations where electric  
utility demand peaks in the late afternoons during summer, it may  
be best to face PV systems approximately to the southwest.  
Shading is detrimental to collector performance and, as such,  
wherever possible collectors should be installed on the least  
shaded location of the building. Shading can arise from nearby  
trees and other buildings and from the building itself. For thermal  
collectors, the degradation is approximately proportional to the  
fraction of the collector array in shade, and so shading is not as  
significant a problem. However, for PV arrays, shading is very  
critical, as in an array possibly all cells are series-connected, and  
shading of even a few cells out of many hundreds will very seri-  
ously degrade performance. A good rule of thumb for PV arrays is  
that if any portion of a subarray of series-connected cells is shad-  
ed, then the output of that subarray will be negligible. Thus, PV  
modules should not be located proximate to any roof section ele-  
vated above it.  
For residential and commercial buildings the architect will most likely  
deal with grid-connected systems, since the loads will most likely be  
AC. However, some applications, such as vacation homes, offshore  
facilities, and so on, will be off-grid, and loads may be DC. In such  
cases, there is no need for the inverter; but for the system to be  
stand-alone, a battery bank must be incorporated. In such systems,  
The issues of collector mounting and support for truly BIPV  
designs are so site-specific that they will not be dealt with here.  
However, it is possibly even more important for the architect’s  
involvement in BIPV designs than for the applications discussed  
here, which are restricted to standoff collector arrays.  
The design of the support structure of a solar collector array can  
have an important influence on overall building appearance and  
design. It is also the aspect of the system that the architect can  
most easily control. If the collector array is to be selected as part  
of a total bid package, for example, sizing and coordination prob-  
lems may result, and the architect may lose control of the array’s  
structural underpinnings and the building’s overall appearance. In  
most cases, collector manufacturers \(thermal and PV\) will offer  
one or more support concepts that are compatible with their par-  
ticular collectors. However, the means for the final anchoring to the  
structure will be the architect’s decision.  
When mounting a collector array on a roof or other structure, the  
underlying supporting structure must be capable of meeting both  
the downward weight of the array as well as the uplift and side-  
ward forces due to wind loadings. In retrofit applications, this may  
mean beefing up the substructure and special treatment for roof  
penetrations. Rooftop collector supports should be anchored  
directly to structural members, not to wood or metal decking;  
otherwise, wind-induced uplift forces and point loading may cause  
roofing and, possibly, structural failure. In steel buildings, vertical  
collector array supports must be secured directly to joists or  
beams. In wood buildings, securing the collectors to structural  
members will normally require the installation of some form of  
blocking, under the decking and between rafters, to adequately  
transfer the load.  
On flat composition roofs, a fairly common approach is “gravity  
mounting,” where the support posts are anchored to pans filled  
with sufficient aggregate to overcome wind forces. Of course, this  
adds to the weight of the system, which must be accommodated in  
the substructure. If anchored supports are used for a collector  
array on a light steel-framed roof, the supports should be anchored  
to the roof beams, and it is not uncommon to increase the capacity  
of the roof structure. Some roofs cannot support such loads and,  
thus, must be clear-spanned. However, long-span space-frame  
structures are invariably costly.

system allows it to provide DC power at night and on cloudy days.  
Batteries will add to the cost of a PV system and require mainte-  
nance and proper location within a building, but may be justified in  
the context of a particular project.  
Stand-alone Alternating Current System\: Off-grid or stand-alone  
systems pair a PV array with batteries for energy storage. An  
inverter converts the DC electricity from the PV modules or the  
batteries to AC electricity so that conventional appliances may be  
used. By definition, a stand-alone system must be power-self-suf-  
ficient. This requires careful coordination of PV production, storage  
capacity, and load patterns to ensure electricity is available at night  
and during periods of bad weather.  
Grid-Connected Alternating Current System\: A grid-connected sys-  
tem interfaces with the local power grid—using the grid as a source  
when the PV system output is inadequate for the connected loads. In  
similar fashion, the grid accepts excess power production from the  
PV array and distributes it to other customers. The grid functions like  
the batteries in a stand-alone system, balancing power production  
and consumption over time. Regulations regarding grid-connected  
PV systems are in flux and vary from state to state; the financial  
arrangements for such interconnections also vary widely.  
Photovoltaic \(PV\) power systems are classified by the nature of the  
electrical current delivered to the loads \(AC or DC\) and the system’s  
relationship to the surrounding power grid. All PV modules initially  
produce DC \(direct current\) electricity. Some PV systems deliver  
this DC power directly to DC loads; other systems convert the DC  
output to AC power for use by AC \(alternating current\) loads. A PV  
system may or may not have battery storage. In a grid-connected  
system, the utility grid assumes the role of the battery backup.  
Direct Current System\: Direct current systems are the simplest  
approach to PV power. The system consists of a PV module or array  
connected directly to a load or loads. Electrical safety, disconnect,  
and control elements will be located between the array and the  
load. With no storage capability, these systems can power loads  
only when adequate solar radiation is available. Common applica-  
tions include water pumping \(including pumping for solar thermal  
collectors\) and ventilation devices. The addition of batteries to this  
Uninterruptible power supply \(UPS\) is designed to provide continu-  
ous power with specific electrical characteristics by conditioning  
utility company power, battery power, or generator-supplied power.  
UPS systems closely control the power supply voltage and fre-  
quency to critical equipment such as computers, communications  
systems, and medical instrumentation.  
UPS systems are either on-line , with power routing through them  
continuously, or off–line , with power routed through them only  
when the incoming power is interrupted or departs from the design  
characteristics. The time required for an off-line, solid-state UPS to  
automatically switch on varies with the type of switch selected\: The  
quicker the switch, the more expensive the switching equipment, in  
general. The time must be matched to the tolerances of the critical  
equipment being supplied by the UPS to prevent loss of data or  
other problems.  
Battery backup time is selected to allow a controlled shutdown of  
equipment, or to allow a backup generator to be started and to  
stabilize at full power.  
Redundant UPS systems may be required if UPS power loss cannot  
be tolerated for system maintenance or equipment breakdown.  
Some equipment can produce electrical disturbances that are fed  
back into the electrical circuit. This must be prevented through  
filtering to maintain clean power to the other equipment being  
supplied by the UPS.  
The UPS unit and battery should be placed close together. Some UPS  
cabinets contain sealed batteries; others require separate batteries.

power outages, when life safety lighting and/or critical equipment  
power requirements are beyond the capacity of battery units, or  
when required by code \(as in hospitals or high-rise buildings\).  
Design requirements are as follows\:  
• Engines should be located away from main electrical switchgear.  
• Engine rooms must have adequate ventilation for engine- and  
generator-radiated heat and must be protected against extreme  
environments under all conditions of airflow.  
• There must be enough room around a power-generating unit to  
service it and to remove the unit.  
• Packaged engine generators require frequent inspections, tests  
under load conditions, and maintenance.  
• Provisions must be made to prevent vibration transmission to  
nearby occupied areas.  
Refer to the National Electric Code for working space requirements  
and proper application.  
Battery-powered lighting equipment provides the minimal emer-  
gency illumination required for personnel safety and evacuation in  
buildings not requiring standby generator power. It is also used in

ing if the generator fails to start. The batteries, which require fre-  
quent inspection, tests, and maintenance, are available in lead

A lightning protection system is an integrated arrangement of air  
terminals, bonding connections, arresters, splicers, and other fit-  
tings installed on a structure to safely conduct to ground any  
lightning discharge to the structure.  
Lightning protection systems and components are grouped into  
three categories \(UL classes\) based on building height and  
intended applications.  
• Class I equipment and systems are for ordinary buildings under  
75 ft. in height.  
• Class II equipment and systems are for those over 75 ft. in  
height.  
• Class II Modified is a special group covering only large, heavy-  
duty stacks and chimneys similar to those used at power plants.  
Each of these system types comprises five or six major groups of  
components\:  
• Air terminals \(lightning rods\) located on the roof and building  
projections  
• Main conductors that tie the air terminals together and connect  
them with the grounding systems  
• Bonds to metal roof structures and equipment  
• Arresters to prevent power line surge damage  
• Ground terminals, typically rods or plates driven or buried in the  
earth  
• Tree protection \(usually applicable only to residential work\)  
These types of equipment and the methods for their installation is  
covered in Figures 13.174 to 13.175.  
Beyond these material requirements, other factors to be consid-  
ered relative to lightning protection systems include\:  
• Selection of codes for compliance  
• Inspection criteria \(again, based on code\)  
• Criteria to evaluate competence of installing personnel  
• Requirements for annual inspection and maintenance  
• Cable runs connecting these center roof air terminals should be  
no longer than 150 ft. without a lead back to the perimeter cable.  
• Gently sloping roofs are classified as flat under these guidelines.  
• Downlead cables to ground should be connected to the roof  
perimeter cable at a maximum spacing of 100 ft. o.c. Buildings  
with a perimeter of 250 to 300 ft. should have three downleads.  
For each additional 100 ft. or fraction thereof, add one downlead.  
• No building or structure should have fewer than two downleads.  
• Arresters should be installed on the electric and telephone ser-  
vices and on all radio and television lead-ins to a structure.  
Responsibility and jurisdiction for the installation of these  
devices can vary with locality, so special consideration may have  
to be given to these items.  
Trees adjacent to residences pose a special hazard, therefore it is  
recommended that all trees larger than an adjacent structure and  
within 10 ft. of it be fully protected. Consult codes or manufacturer  
for recommendations on materials and installation requirements.  
On-site inspections and certification of completed systems, install-  
er competency certification, and guaranteed inspection/mainte-  
nance options are all available under existing standards. Consult  
codes and standards for specifics.  
\(lower than adjacent air terminals\) and within 6 ft. or a calculated  
bonding distance, it should be bonded to the lightning protection  
system. Smaller, secondary-size materials may be used for these  
connections. Metal bodies taller than the air terminals and less  
than 3/16-in. thick require air terminal protection. Those greater  
than 3/16-in. thick are protected if adequately bonded.  
In some cases, especially on tall structures, it may be advantageous  
to substitute the steel frame of a structure for portions of the usual  
conductor system, normally the downleads. Connections are made  
to cleaned areas of the building steel, at grade and at roof levels,  
and the columns serve to connect the roof and ground systems.  
The following codes, technical sources, and quality control proce-  
dures are standards for lightning protection systems.  
• Lightning Protection Institute, “Installation Code LPI–175”  
• National Fire Protection Association, “Lightning Protection Code  
NFPA 780”  
• Underwriters Laboratories, Master Label Program under “U.L.  
Installation Requirements 96A”  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
System design guidelines state that\:  
• Air terminals should be located around the perimeter of flat-roof  
buildings and along the ridge of pitched-roof buildings spaced at  
20 ft. o.c., maximum, and be located not more than 2 ft. from  
ridge ends, outside corners, and edges of building walls.  
• Full-size main conductors should connect all air terminals.  
• Additional air terminals should be located in the center of large,  
open, flat spacings, not to exceed 50 ft.  
All buildings and equipment should be grounded to protect people  
and equipment from fault currents. A complete interconnected  
system should be installed according to the requirements of the  
National Electrical Code and the National Electrical Safety Code.  
The structural steel of the building is connected to a buried  
“ground grid” to ensure NEC requirements are met. All electrical  
equipment is connected with this system to provide a direct path to  
the earth. Specify the number of ground rods and conductor size  
according to National Electrical Code requirements.  
Codes vary slightly regarding bonding requirements for metal bod-  
ies on rooftops. Generally, if a metal body is in a zone of protection  
13.174 Adhesives are typically used for flat-roof installation.

# ELEMENT D\: SERVICES COMMUNICATIONS  
# COMMUNICATIONS  
Communications systems cover a wide range of needs and equip-  
ment in a modern building. They transfer information between  
spatially separated points using a suitable medium \(typically wired  
or wireless\). Communications systems enhance safety, security,  
control, and productivity. They are ubiquitous in today’s buildings.  
In general, such systems tend to be low-voltage \(if wired\), often  
proprietary \(leading to integration and coordination challenges\),  
and prone to rapid renovations and updates. Ease of access for  
updates is a hallmark design requirement of many communications  
systems.  
The fundamental components in a communication system are\:  
messages, sender, receiver, medium, and protocols. Building con-  
trol systems typically include a logic element to determine an  
appropriate action as a result of a signal.  
• Messages\: The message is the information to be communicated.  
It can be text, numbers, audio, video, or any combination of  
these.  
• Sender\: The sender is the device that transmits the message. It  
can be a computer, workstation, telephone handset, video cam-  
era, etc.  
• Receiver\: The receiver is the device that receives the message.  
It can be a computer, mechanical equipment, telephone handset,  
television, etc.  
• Medium\: The transmission medium is the physical path by which  
a message travels from sender to receiver. It may be a twisted-  
pair wire, co-axial cable, fiber optic cable, or electromagnetic  
waves. Wireless transmission is becoming increasingly popular  
across all types of communication. This can simplify architec-  
tural planning, but the security of wireless transmissions \(espe-  
cially for systems control functions\) must be considered.  
• Protocol\: A protocol is a set of rules that govern the data com-  
munication. It represents an arrangement between the com-  
municating devices. Without a protocol, two devices may be  
connected but not able to communicate. Standardized protocols,  
such as BACnet and LonWorks, have been established for build-  
ing control networks.  
TIA/EIA \(Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronics  
Industry Association\) standards should be used to define the mini-  
mum architectural requirements for telecommunications spaces.  
There are three main categories of spaces\: service entrances,  
equipment rooms, and telecommunications rooms. Each of these  
interrelated space types has a distinct function.  
• Building Service Entrance\: An independent room where voice,  
data, and video distribution systems enter the building.  
• Equipment Room\: A space dedicated solely to telecommunica-  
tions systems equipment, such as a voice switching node,  
backbone network devices, and/or video transmission equipment.  
• Telecommunications Room\: Spaces used to facilitate intercon-  
nections between the building backbone \(riser\) system and  
stations on a given floor; often located on each floor of a build-  
ing. These rooms may also be used to house some local elec-  
tronic equipment.  
Telecommunications rooms provide the transition points between  
risers and horizontal cabling and accommodate associated cable  
termination hardware and transport electronics. Telecommunications  
rooms should be large enough to accommodate the service area,  
and meet environmental, lighting, fire protection, security, and  
cable pathway requirements. Horizontal cabling may not exceed  
295 ft. in total length, which will dictate room locations. Carefully  
managed cable pathways, routing paths to workstations, and ceil-  
ing height must be considered for appropriate placement of tele-  
communications rooms.  
Horizontal telecommunications cabling may be routed between  
telecommunications rooms and workstations via access floors,  
cellular decks, and ceiling plenums. Access floor distribution facili-  
tates the installation of future cabling as well as the movement of  
floor boxes and cable feed-throughs to accommodate furniture  
relocations. Cellular decks provide similar underfloor cable path-  
ways, yet lack the flexibility of relocatable floor boxes. Other distri-  
bution approaches include underfloor plenum routing, which  
requires poke-through fittings for access to workstations, and  
ceiling routing, which is most appropriate for installations with  
accessible ceiling plenums.

A local area network \(LAN\) interconnects computers within a build-  
ing. The transmission medium \(typically twisted-pair cable or Wi-Fi\)  
is managed within the confines of the building. In contrast, a WAN  
\(wide area network\) extends beyond a single building and may  
involve leased communications elements.  
Key considerations related to a wired LAN include\:  
• Control, security, reliability, and speed are enhanced by a wired  
network of connections  
• A wired network is relatively cost-effective  
• Wire management may be a challenge  
Key considerations related to a wireless \(Wi-Fi\) LAN include\:  
• Flexibility in device location is enhanced by removing the need  
for a physical connection point  
• Wi-Fi is generally physically neater  
• Speeds are typically slower than with wired networks  
• Security can be a greater challenge than with defined-connec-  
tion point networks  
• Providing adequate network signal strength can be difficult in  
some building configurations \(and there are no simple rules of  
thumb for router placement\)

Also called building automation systems, a building management  
system \(BMS\) provides automated control of some aspect of build-  
ing operations—typically including HVAC and lighting systems  
control. Other aspects of building operation may be included in the  
scope of such a system, including fire detection, security, and  
access.  
Building management systems can be wired, wireless, or hybrid.  
Control of environmental systems is typically implemented by  
direct digital controls \(DDC\). A BMS should provide opportunities  
for datalogging \(trending\) and automated fault detection. Such a  
system would be the foundation for an intelligent building—which  
could learn from past events as a means of anticipating future  
actions.  
Floor boxes are for shared audiovisual, telecommunications, and  
electrical \(120 VAC\) connectivity. Internal audiovisual components  
\(i.e., custom plates and connectors\) are furnished and installed by  
the audiovisual contractor.  
The major components of a video system are the camera, lens, and  
mount; lighting system; transmission system; synchronization  
system; video switching equipment; video recorder; video monitor;  
and video controller. Digital video systems consist of Internet  
Protocol \(IP\) addressable cameras, digital video recorders, net-  
work video management systems, monitors, and network video  
management software. Digital video systems are network-capable,  
and video can be transmitted across LAN and WAN networks to a  
centralized location and multiple network workstations.

Common card technologies include\:  
• Bar code cards have a series of vertical or horizontal stripes and  
spaces printed in a manner that represents coded data. The  
spaces between the stripes are read optically by a photodetec-  
tor cell.  
• Embossed cards exhibit pattern codes that are raised or  
indented in the card’s surface and read by their relative position  
in the card reader.  
• Hollerith cards have a pattern of small holes punched into the  
card that presents specific data to the card reader. This card can  
be read optically or mechanically. The optical reader depends on  
the light patterns passing through the holes; the mechanical  
reader uses electric reed, brush, or switch contacts to read the  
coded patterns.  
• Infrared cards depend on encoding information with varying  
density patterns that are read by infrared detectors. The pat-  
terns are optically detected and not visible to the human eye.  
• Magnetic slug cards have magnetic slugs or metal pieces  
embedded or layered in them; they are read by magnetic sens-  
ing devices. Also known as shim cards , they are generally lim-  
ited to a single code, making them most suitable for parking  
operations.  
• Magnetic stripe cards have stripes or layers of a magnetic mate-  
rial embedded between layers or on a card’s surface in vertical  
columns or horizontal rows. Areas or patterns on this magnetic  
material can be magnetized in coded patterns and read by mag-  
netic sensing devices.  
• Optical memory cards depend on varied transparency densities  
arranged in rows, columns, or spots. These patterns are read by  
a system of light sources and photodetectors.  
• Proximity cards incorporate embedded or laminated resonating  
frequency \(RF\) circuits that use electrically tuned circuits that  
resonate when activated by a transmitter sweeping through the  
RF range. A receiver picks up the RM and activates the code-  
deciphering system. Unlike other access cards, the proximity  
card can be worn or carried and detected at various ranges,  
depending on the design capabilities of the system.

• Smart cards can be either active or passive in design. Active  
cards contain a lithium power supply for transmission; passive  
cards are read through powered antennae strategically located.  
Smart cards can hold a very large amount of data.  
• Watermark magnetic cards contain small oxide particles physi-  
cally oriented into zones of varying widths creating an unalter-  
able 10- or 12-digit code number, while leaving another layer of  
the magnetic stripe available for encoding soft conventional  
data.  
• Wiegand cards use magnetically embedded unstable ferromag-  
netic wires formed in a permanently tensioned helical twist. The  
wiegand card reader uses a magnetic coil that picks up the flux  
reversal characteristics of the wires and converts them to  
binary pulses.  
Audible alarms must have an intensity and frequency that attract  
the attention of those with partial hearing loss. Such alarms should  
exceed the prevailing sound level in the space by at least 15 dBA  
or exceed any maximum sound level with a duration of 60 seconds  
by 5 dBA, whichever is louder. Sound levels should not exceed  
120 dBA.  
The simplest fire alarm system is a self-contained, UL-approved  
residential smoke detector. It senses products of combustion,  
sounds an alarm, and signals when the battery needs replace-  
ment. Most municipalities require the use of smoke detectors in  
houses, apartments, and motel/hotel rooms. Check local codes for  
requirements.  
More complex systems are needed in buildings where public  
safety is an issue, such as schools, hospitals, office buildings, and  
other commercial establishments or institutions. Although there  
are still applications for small hard-wired and relay-operated  
alarm signaling systems, the trend is to use microprocessor-based  
digital multiplex systems that not only signal the presence of a fire  
but also initiate other measures, including activating fans and  
dampers for smoke control, closing fire doors and shutters, releas-  
ing locked doors, capturing elevators, and transmitting voice mes-  
sages. Building codes require voice communication in buildings  
with specific group occupancies. It is also recommended for other  
large buildings to enhance life safety.  
Fire alarm systems can either function alone or be integrated with  
security and building management functions. Processors and their  
peripheral equipment are generally located in a manned central  
command center accessible to firefighters. Depending on the  
degree of reliability desired, redundancy can be provided in wiring  
and processors, along with battery backup.  
Alarm system control cabinets can be 36 in. wide by 8 in. deep.  
They must have battery backup, be UL-approved, and conform to  
NFPA No. 72; they may also require local approval. In small sys-  
tems where only one cabinet is required, all the functions required  
of the command center can be incorporated in a cabinet located in  
the main entrance lobby. In larger systems, remote cabinets are  
generally located in wiring closets throughout the building and can  
be programmed to function independently of the central processor,  
should it fail.  
Visual alarm signals should be integrated into the building alarm  
system. Alarm stations should give both audible and visual signals.  
Visual alarm signals should have the following characteristics\:  
• Lamp\: Xenon strobe type or equivalent.  
• Lamp Color\: Clear or nominal white \(i.e., unfiltered or clear fil-  
tered white light\).  
• Maximum Pulse Duration\: 0.2 sec with a maximum duty cycle of  
40 percent. The pulse duration is defined as the time interval  
between initial and final points of 10 percent of maximum signal.  
• Intensity\: 75 candela minimum.  
• Flash Rate\: 1 Hz minimum, 3 Hz maximum.  
Visual alarms are placed 80 in. above the highest floor level within  
the space or 6 in. below the ceiling, whichever is lower. In any  
space required to have a visual alarm, generally all areas must be  
within 50 ft. of the signal \(measured horizontally\). In large spaces  
exceeding 100 ft. across with no obstructions over 6 ft. high \(such  
as auditoriums\), devices may be spaced a maximum of 100 ft. apart  
around the perimeter in lieu of suspending devices from the ceiling.  
An interdependent arrangement of physical barriers, technological  
devices, and response capabilities constitutes a responsive and  
complete security delivery system.  
The physical security components primarily consist of fences,  
building enclosure elements, interior partitions and doors, and  
safes and vaults.  
The proliferation of electronic security devices and systems, cou-  
pled with rapid and substantial advances in the capabilities of  
these systems, has resulted in a wide array of choices in security  
technology. To choose effectively among these, architects should  
understand the principles and applications of crime prevention  
through environmental design \(CPTED\), security design, and opera-  
tional security.  
Use of alarmed surveillance systems can greatly reduce property  
loss. This involves the use of alarms, perimeter protection, and  
intrusion detection systems. Integrated systems—those that  
employ the proper procedures, equipment, and people in combina-  
tion—are the most effective.  
In general, the security response capabilities at a particular facil-  
ity depend on the efforts of the on-site security team. Architects,  
however, must design buildings that enable security staff to  
respond efficiently to incidents requiring their action.  
Sensor security systems are commonly designed to protect perim-  
eters or to monitor interior space.

Common system types are defined as\:  
• Noncoded\: Evacuation signal sounds continuously.  
• Master Coded\: Signal repeats four rounds.  
• Selective Coded\: Same as master coded, except individual and  
assigned number codes of up to three groups per round.  
• Presignal\: Same as selective coded, except signals sound only  
at selected areas to prompt investigation. If a hazard is deter-  
mined, an evacuation signal is initiated by key.  
• Voice\: Direct \(by microphone\) or automatic prerecorded mes-  
sages are transmitted over speakers, following an alert signal.

Perimeter sensor systems may include the following features\:  
• Continuous line of detection  
• In-depth protection  
• Complementary sensors  
• Alarm combination  
• Priority schemes  
• Clear zone  
• Site-specific system  
• Sensor configuration  
• Tamper protection  
• Self-test compatibility  
• Suitability for physical and environmental conditions  
• Integration with video system  
• Integration with barrier delay  
Physical and environmental conditions that affect exterior sensors  
include topography, vegetation, wildlife, background noise, climate  
and weather, and soil and pavement.  
Conceptual design of a perimeter sensor system involves identify-  
ing targets, defining threats, establishing security requirements,  
and developing basic security features. Design development  
requires defining the clear zone surface, determining sensor loca-  
tions, completing system engineering and specifications, locating  
perimeter fencing, and designing power and signal distribution.  
Construction involves procuring materials, performing surveys,  
installing conduit and wiring, applying surface material, and install-  
ing outer fences and sensors. Correct operation requires mainte-  
nance, testing, training, and documentation.  
Interior detection systems offer in-depth protection, detect intrud-  
ers in time for adequate response, detect tampering, and are able  
to self-test. To be effective, however, they must be properly located,  
installed, and maintained.  
Descriptions of the most common types of sensors follow.  
Environmental conditions that affect interior sensors include elec-  
tromagnetic energy, nuclear radiation, acoustic energy, thermal  
energy, optical effects, seismic phenomena, and meteorological  
conditions.  
• Ultrasonic motion detectors are used when air turbulence is low  
and when there are external noise sources that could affect a  
motion detector radiating energy outside of the protected area.  
Use low-frequency detectors where audible noise is not objec-  
tionable.  
• Microwave motion detectors are used when air turbulence is  
present in the protected room and when there are no potential  
false alarm sources outside of the room and in the field of the  
detector.  
• Passive infrared detectors are used when air turbulence is pres-  
ent in an area or at a point to be protected. Temperature  
changes do not affect this type of device, but abrupt changes in  
light level may cause false alarms.  
• Detectors for room boundaries are used to give the earliest  
possible warning of an intrusion. They are used only in conjunc-  
tion with space detectors for the interior of a room; vibration  
detectors, acoustic detectors, break beams, magnetic reed  
switches, and breakwires are suggested.  
• Multiple space detectors are used jointly when detectors are not  
affected in the same measure by external noise sources and to  
reduce false alarms while still maintaining a reasonable proba-  
bility of detection. Multiple space detectors are used singly  
when one type of detector can protect one part of a room and  
another detector can protect another part of a room because  
external noise sources are specifically located.  
• Vibration detectors are used when air turbulence, acoustic  
noises, and motion outside the room are present. These devices  
are best suited to protecting room boundaries from penetration  
by drilling or hammering.  
• Acoustic detectors are used when light air turbulence, vibration,  
and motion are present outside the room. These devices are  
most effective in protecting room boundaries from penetration  
by drilling or hammering.  
• Thermal detectors are used to detect temperature rises in small  
enclosures such as vaults \(as when an intruder uses a torch or  
burning bar to gain entrance\). This device would normally be  
used in a system that includes other types of intrusion detectors.

Vehicular security walls include different types of construction,  
depending on the vehicle size and velocity or anticipated velocity of  
the vehicle. The U.S. Department of State has developed K Ratings  
for vehicles by size and velocity to determine criteria by which to  
construct walls, bollards, or other devices that will prevent a  
vehicle from penetrating those devices or walls.

There are several manufacturers of equipment made for opera-  
tional, movable vehicle arrest devices that can be placed at loading  
docks, driveways, or entrances to parking areas. These devices are  
tested by special testing laboratories and witnessed by the U.S.  
Department of State or other federal officials and then certified for  
use. Similar to the security criteria mentioned previously, the spe-  
cific site or building must be assessed for security program and  
security requirements. As a result of those requirements being  
developed and agreed to, and if warranted, vehicular arrest  
devices, wall construction, or similar equipment may be necessary  
for the site or building perimeter. A typical detail for fixed bollards  
is shown in Figure 14.5. Although not common, the vehicular arrest  
device construction may be used in conjunction with a chain linked  
or other type of wall to prevent and/or deter both pedestrian and  
vehicular access to a site. Another option to the vehicular bollards  
or concrete wall construction is the use of two or three steel  
cables, approximately 1-in. diameter, mounted to “dead-men”  
\(concrete or steel fence post\) just behind a pedestrian-type fence.  
The cable assembly with the dead-men will prevent certain sized  
vehicles at certain velocities from gaining access to the site, and  
may provide a more pleasing aesthetic appearance.  
Consistent with the philosophy of crime prevention through envi-  
ronmental design \(CPTED\), architects use a combination of design  
and operational tools to address projects requiring site security.  
These tools include access control of pedestrians on the site, natu-  
ral and mechanical surveillance of occupants of the property, and  
clear definition of public and private space through a combination  
of real and symbolic barriers.  
When terrorism, workplace violence, or street crime is possible  
on a site, the U.S. General Services Administration recommends  
the following for all government buildings\:  
• Eliminate potential hiding places near the facility.  
• Provide an unobstructed view around the facility.  
• Place the facility within view of other occupied facilities.  
• Locate assets stored on-site but outside the facility within view  
of occupied rooms in the facility.  
• Minimize the signage or indication of assets on the property.  
• Set the facility a minimum of 100 ft. from the facility boundary, if  
possible.  
• Eliminate lines of approach perpendicular to the building.  
• Minimize the number of vehicle access points.  
• Eliminate or strictly control parking beneath facilities.  
• Locate parking as far from the building as practical, while  
accommodating accessibility requirements for parking spaces  
and their proximity to the building. Place parking within view of  
occupied rooms or facilities.  
• Illuminate the exterior of the building and/or exterior sites  
where assets are located.  
• Secure access to power/heat plants, gas mains, water supplies,  
and electrical and phone service.  
• Design elements commonly used to create real and symbolic  
barriers to increase site security include bollards/planters,  
curbs, vehicle barriers, gates, security lighting, and signage.  
Active barriers at access/egress points in high-security areas  
should be fully engaged until vehicles are cleared for passage. A  
visible signal light or drop arm should indicate the status of the  
barrier to approaching vehicles. Operating time should not exceed  
three to four seconds. In case of power failure, the barrier system  
must be capable of maintaining its position to prevent access but be  
capable of manual operation; it also should be connected to emer-  
gency power. Remote controls should include a status indicator.

or painted finishes. Bronze is most difficult to maintain; satin,  
polished, or statuary finishes must have a protective lacquer  
coating. Doors are available with only top and bottom stiles to  
be used with all-glass storefront doors. Wall enclosures may be  
all metal, all glass, partial glass, or housed-in construction.  
• Optional heating and cooling source should be placed immedi-  
ately adjacent to the enclosure.  
• For general planning, use 6-ft-6-in. diameter. For hotels, depart-  
ment stores, airports, or other large traffic areas, use 7-ft or  
greater diameter.  
• Codes may allow 50 percent of legal exiting requirements by  
means of revolving doors. Some do not credit any, and require  
hinged doors adjacent to revolving doors. Verify with local  
authorities.  
Swing doors may be required in addition to revolving doors by code  
or for good practice to provide egress, to meet accessibility  
requirements, or for off-hours security operation.

Illustrated in Figures 14.11 through 14.13 are the most common  
food and beverage vending machine styles, whose sizes vary with  
total capacity.  
Service access of machines is generally from the front, although  
some cigarette machines require access from the top. Front clear-  
ance of 5 ft. is preferred for machines. If machines are located in  
dedicated rooms, a double door or a door larger than 3 ft. wide is  
preferred for vending machine transport and installation.  
Hot water is not required, but some beverage units require a cold  
water supply with a shutoff valve. Typically, overflow waste collects  
into an internal tray. Refrigerated vending machines and microwave  
ovens require a rear wall clearance of up to 8 in., to permit cooling.  
Electric service is usually 120 volt and a separate circuit for each  
machine is preferred. Amperages vary widely from 2 to 20 A.  
A wide range of vending equipment is available and generally  
custom-fabricated to meet specific requirements. Consult manu-  
facturers of vending equipment for special applications; be sure to  
consult applicable codes, standards, and regulations for accessibil-  
ity requirements.

Checkrooms should be adjacent to and have line-of-sight interac-  
tion with a lobby or circulation path between building entry and  
destination \(auditorium, gallery, etc.\). Provide ample space for  
orderly queuing out of the main circulation pathways. This is of  
particular importance in theaters, concert halls, and similar audi-  
ence facilities where check-in and checkout of massive numbers of  
people occur in a very compressed period of time. In galleries,  
museums, and restaurants, traffic is more evenly dispersed,  
resulting in a diminished need for queuing space and a smaller  
staffing requirement for the checkroom itself.  
For general planning purposes, allow between 1–1/8 and 1–1/2 in.  
of rack space per garment, depending on climate. Allow for storage  
of hats, umbrellas, briefcases, and packages. Most conventional  
checkroom racks contain overhead shelves to permit accessories  
to be stored with the coat. For ease of access, shelves should not  
extend above 6 ft-8 in.  
For small to medium-sized facilities, conventional checkrooms are  
adequate. In large facilities however, where hundreds of garments  
will be accommodated, consider the use of automated conveyor  
equipment. These systems conserve space and time by eliminating  
access aisles and the need to search for garments.

Food service equipment is typically specified by the food service  
consultant. All food service equipment must meet the sanitation  
and construction standards of the National Sanitation Foundation  
\(NSF\), an independent nonprofit organization dealing with public  
health issues. Most equipment is located in the “back of the  
house,” however, some food-serving display units, such as salad  
bars, may be located in the public dining areas. Sneeze guards are  
required at open food displays, and refrigeration is required to  
store and serve perishable food.  
Exhaust hoods remove air, water and grease vapor, and food odors  
from the kitchen and dishwashing areas. Ovens and steam-jacket-  
ed kettles only require hoods that remove air, heat, and water  
vapor. If large amounts of grease from a broiler, char-broiler, fryer,  
or grill are present, the hood system must extract this pollutant  
before the air is drawn outside by fans. This is done with grease  
“cartridges” or with stainless steel extractors, both of which blow  
the exhausted air around violently. The grease particles are col-  
lected in a trough for easy removal or are run down a drain. If a  
water-wash hood is used, the drain must tie into a grease trap.  
Hood requirements are as follows\:  
• The length of the hood and the equipment types underneath  
determines CFM requirements for exhaust hoods. Typical  
requirements range from 150 to 450 CFM per linear foot of hood.  
• Some codes may require a higher exhaust rate. To make up this  
air differential and to prevent more air from being drawn from  
surrounding areas, introduce air through a supply duct. The sup-  
plied air should make up 50 to 85 percent of the total exhaust.

The security of the nation’s public facilities, such as schools, air-  
ports, and courthouses, has taken on an increased importance. The  
National Institute of Justice \(NIJ\) has developed standards in the  
area of such detection devices, which outline requirements for  
system performance, including operator interface and/or controls,  
test objects, electromagnetic compatibility, and safety.  
Consult the following reference\:  
• National Institute of Justice Standards, www.nlectc.org.  
Among the most commonly used contraband-detection devices in  
public facilities is the walk-through metal detector. These detectors  
are available in a wide range of configurations and sizes, to meet  
a wide range of requirements. Refer to applicable codes, stan-  
dards, and regulations for accessibility requirements.  
Electronic article surveillance \(EAS\) devices are anti-shoplifting  
systems used to protect merchandise, libraries, and similar retail  
installations. Such systems include an antenna and tags and/or  
labels. Units are configured based on signal strength, and multiple  
units can be ganged to effectively protect any exit configuration.  
When purchases are registered, tags are either removed or  
passed over a deactivation pad. In some cases, deactivation is  
achieved by installation of a wire loop device beneath the counter.  
X-ray machines and scanners are being installed increasingly more  
frequently in airports, government buildings, mailrooms, and  
security-sensitive areas, for scanning letters, small parcels, brief-  
cases, and baggage. This equipment ranges from very compact,  
self-contained tabletop or floor-standing units to conveyorized  
screening equipment used in airports, cargo terminals, and the  
like. These units can weigh up to 2,000 lbs.  
When considering larger equipment, carefully examine transport  
routes, to ensure adequate clearances for equipment delivery and  
staging. Refer to manufacturers’ literature for electromechanical  
requirements.  
Configurations of entry tables, exit conveyors, and operator  
stool\(s\) are project- and volume-specific. Units are available with  
remote operator display capability.

Patient rooms must be accessible, easy to maintain, and spacious  
enough to contain high-tech life-support and monitoring equip-  
ment. Entry doors should be a minimum of 48 in. wide. A clear area  
of 48 in. should be maintained at the foot of patient beds.  
Equip patient rooms with basic amenities such as a patient chair,  
visitor chair, television set \(VCR and computer with Internet  
access, optional\), wardrobe for full-length garments and luggage,  
drawers for clothing and personal items, and countertop or open  
shelving for flowers and cards. Patient rooms include toilet facili-  
ties with direct access, although central bathing areas may be  
provided in lieu of individual showers.  
Doors to accessible toilet rooms must provide a clear opening of  
32 in. minimum when opened 90°. If doors swing in, equip them  
with hardware that permits emergency access. Universal precau-  
tions require a lavatory in or near the entrance to each patient  
room for clinical use, and a place to store gloves, masks, and  
gowns. Space for electronic equipment, such as a patient data  
terminal and printer, may be required.  
Semiprivate patient rooms should contain cubicle curtains for  
visual privacy.  
Patients in an intensive care unit \(ICU\) are under continuous  
observation; therefore each room should be visible from the nurse  
station or a staffed corridor workstation. Each unit must contain  
equipment for continuous monitoring and provide a nurse call at  
each bed for summoning assistance.  
Beds should be within view of an exterior, preferably operable,  
window. If operable windows are provided, restrict degree of  
opening width to prevent escape or suicide attempts. Provide  
bedside space for visitors and a curtain for visual privacy.  
Doors should be a minimum of 48 in. wide. Sliding doors may be  
used for access to rooms or cubicles within a suite.  
Provide at least one private room or cubicle in each ICU for  
patients requiring isolation and/or separation.  
Toilet units can be provided in each bed area, along with a sink, a  
countertop for preparing medications, and universal precautions  
storage. IV tracks and exam lights are typically placed above each  
bed. Rolling life-support equipment often occupies space at the  
side and foot of the bed. Maintain a minimum of 48 in. on three  
sides of each bed. Utility columns containing power outlets and  
medical gas and communications devices allow 360° access  
around the patient.

General-purpose examination rooms comprise the building blocks  
of outpatient facility design. Room configuration varies but the  
minimum room dimension is generally 8 ft. The size for examination  
rooms needs to be a minimum of 80 sq. ft., but 110 sq. ft. is recom-  
mended. Typically, medical providers work from the patient’s right  
side \(see Figure 14.28\); therefore, rooms should be planned to  
permit this. In pediatric facilities, the exam table is often located  
with the patient’s left against the wall, to increase safety. In  
women’s health facilities, the table is positioned to face away from  
the room entrance door. Often, cubicle curtains are included to  
screen the patient from the corridor when the door is opened.  
Teleconferencing is voice or data communication between remote  
locations. Videoconferencing is teleconferencing with visual images  
added to voice and data communications. Generally, a videoconfer-  
ence space includes one or two video screens that enable conference  
participants to see and hear each other. When two displays are  
provided, one is generally used to show conference participants,  
and the other is used to show graphic images, information from a  
visual presenter or VCR. When there is only one display, the users  
can choose to view the conference or the graphic information on  
the larger part of the screen, and can view the other image in a  
“picture-in-picture” window.  
Outpatient dialysis facilities generally include open treatment posi-  
tions. In Figure 14.29, a reclining chair is positioned against a  
service wall in an arrangement where privacy is achieved through  
a cubicle curtain arrangement. A minimum of 80 sq. ft. is required  
for each treatment station, and 145 sq. ft. is recommended with an  
aisle between stations.  
Space requirements for chemotherapy/oncology patients are simi-  
lar. Often, the cubicle curtain is replaced by a fixed screen or parti-  
tion to increase privacy.

The vertical viewing angle is the angle from the viewer's eyes to  
the top of the image. For the optimum sight line, it should not  
exceed 30° to 35° above the horizontal.  
Vertical sight line studies provide information about how the image  
area relates to both the seating area and the projectors in pro-  
jected image configurations. The typical concerns are that the  
screen should not be too high above any viewer, and that video  
projectors are not too far above or below the screen, which could  
require optical or electronic corrections for the image to display  
properly. Another concern is simply the avoidance of obstades  
between either the audience and the display or a projector and the  
screen.  
Many video projectors are available with optional lenses that allow  
placement toward the front or at the center or rear of the room.  
The majority of video projectors are designed to be elevated so  
that the lens is approximately aligned with the top or bottom of the  
image. For rear projection, the lenses are often designed to allow  
the projector to be on the airis of the screen center.

The two primary design goals are intelligibility and legibility.  
Intelligibility defines the degree to which an audience member can  
clearly understand the spoken word of a presenter or recorded  
material, as measured by the articulation loss of consonants.  
Legibility relates to how well each audience member can comfort-  
ably read displayed words, numbers, and graphic elements. The  
design parameters are first considered from the most distant  
viewer position, which is the worst seat in the house. If the person  
in the farthest seat can see and hear clearly, then all closer seats  
will naturally be within acceptable margins.

The design of an audiovisual facility within a finished interior space  
presents a specific set of multidisciplinary challenges that must be  
considered to ensure a successful system solution. Most AV sys-  
tems have elements that affect the following trades and disciplines\:  
• Architecture and interior design  
• Electrical  
• Information technologies  
• Telephony  
• Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning  
• Low-voltage cabling  
• Lighting  
• Acoustics  
• Structural  
• Ergonomics  
In order to address the issues relating to the integration of audio-  
visual hardware into the architectural space, the starting point for  
any AV system should be in the domain of ergonomics and human  
factors, addressing the means and methods and dimensions to be  
used to deliver visual and audible information to people gathered  
in a room, whatever the dimension. Fundamental rules apply  
whether it is a small meeting room or a large auditorium. The  
design should initially be considered from the standpoint of an  
audience member who is receiving visual and audible information  
from a live presenter or through a display and sound system.  
Equally important in AV design to having clear line of sight and leg-  
ibility for the displays is the intelligibility of the spoken word. The  
sound system should be designed and located to deliver crisp, clear  
audio, free from any howling feedback or artifacts that degrade the  
ability to understand. The target for the sound system is to deliver  
audio at 10 to 20 dB above the ambient background noise. This is  
achieved by using the proper types and directionality of speakers  
based on architectural surfaces, room shape, and seating areas.  
Many architectural factors affect the clarity of the sound system,  
including\:  
• Cubic footage of space, which affects how long the reverbera-  
tion or echo is from walls, floor, and ceiling  
• Surface finishes, which provide a degree of sound absorption  
that reduces reverberation  
• Dimensions of the ceiling, which affect the distance between a  
microphone and speakers, thus having an impact on the amount  
of loudness that can be achieved before howling feedback occurs  
• Curved walls, which focus sound into hot spots and dead spots  
• In large spaces, the width-to-length ratio of the room should not  
be a perfect multiple or harmonic, which may cause standing  
14.38 Minimum sight lines should be based on a two-row overview. This  
assumes that viewers can see between the heads of the people seated  
in the row directly in front of them.

waves bouncing between surfaces; these negatively affect intel-

• Noise caused by HVAC fans and ducts, which adds to the back-  
ground noise  
There are a wide variety of spaces that may be considered presen-  
tation rooms\: training rooms, lecture halls, classrooms, board-  
rooms, and auditoriums are common examples. These spaces typi-  
cally share common AV requirements of image presentation along  
with audio media playback of program material and possibly  
speech reinforcement, depending on the size of the space. Within  
each of these categories, there are some common requirements.  
Presentation furnishings include easels, lecterns, and portable  
sound systems. An audiovisual presentation system often includes  
the following equipment\:  
• Video display \(video projector, flat-screen video display\)  
• Microphones, loudspeakers, and amplifiers  
• Routing switcher \(becoming less common\)  
• Remote control system  
• A computer, for presentations or to browse the Internet  
• Projector hookup for a portable notebook computer  
• Document/object camera, for use with printed documents or  
small objects \(becoming less common\)  
• Video equipment, including monitors, digital video disc \(DVD\)  
players, and camcorders  
Typically, each of these components is provided by a different  
manufacturer. AV integrators combine these various components  
and ensure that they are properly installed.  
For viewing images, the application and type of content should be  
determined. For example, legibility of displayed characters and  
symbols is of critical importance for instructional material in edu-  
cational and other settings. In some spaces, more detailed image  
viewing may be required, such as in medical or military facilities.  
This will impact the image sizing requirements.  
For the audio components, the need for audio program material  
must be considered in terms of numbers of channels of playback  
\(e.g., monaural, stereo, or surround sound\), and the need for  
reinforcement of speech must be determined \(e.g., in a large house  
of worship or an auditorium\).  
An ideal home kitchen design depends on a number of factors but  
in particular, the living habits and possessions of the kitchen users.  
A design that is considered excellent for one user may be unsuit-  
able for another.  
The major components of a well-planned kitchen are traffic and  
workflow; cabinets and storage; appliance placement and use/  
clearance space; counter surface and landing space; and room,  
appliance, and equipment controls.  
Important design guidelines for working with residential kitchens  
include\:  
• No entry door, appliance door, or cabinet door should interfere  
with another door.  
• All major appliances used for surface cooking should have a  
ventilation system, with a fan rated at 150 CFM minimum.  
• No two primary work centers \(the primary sink, refrigerator,  
preparation, or cooktop/range center\) should be separated by a  
full-height, full-depth cabinet \(measured from floor to top of wall

• Work aisles \(passages between vertical objects, both of which are  
work counters or appliances\) should be at least 42 in. wide in one-  
cook kitchens, and at least 48 in. wide in multiple-cook kitchens.  
• Open countertop corners should be clipped or radiused, and  
countertop edges should be eased to eliminate sharp edges.  
• Controls, handles, and door/drawer pulls should be operable with  
one hand; require only a minimal amount of strength for operation;  
and not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist.  
• Ground fault circuit interrupters should be specified on all  
receptacles in a kitchen.  
• A fire extinguisher should be visibly located in the kitchen, away  
from cooking equipment and 15 to 48 in. above the floor; smoke  
alarms should be included near the kitchen.  
• The window/skylight area should equal at least 10 percent of  
the total square footage of a separate kitchen or of a total living  
space that includes a kitchen.  
• Every work surface in a kitchen should be well lit by appropriate  
task and/or general lighting.  
In an enclosed configuration, allow a minimum at least a 3-in.  
clearance from the side wall, with flame-retardant surfacing mate-  
rial. The cooking surface and the adjacent counter area should be  
the same height.  
For a complete AV system, audio and video components mounted  
in the space with the user include equipment such as video dis-  
plays, loudspeakers, microphones, cameras, connector plates, and  
control user interfaces. In addition, other devices will often be  
located outside the main user space. These may include AV control  
rooms, equipment rooms, and rear-projection rooms.

# ELEMENT E\: EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS EQUIPMENT  
A measurement of 24 in. minimum from the adjacent counter to the  
centerline of the sink makes possible a clear floor space of 30 by  
48 in. centered on the sink. If the kitchen has only one sink, it  
should be located between or across from the cooking surface,  
preparation area, or refrigerator.  
Although the kitchen has evolved around three basic appliances—  
the sink, the range, and the refrigerator—a kitchen usually has  
many more centers of activity. Other considerations are primary or  
secondary cleanup sink center, preparation center, cooking center,  
microwave oven center, pantry center, a serving center, dining  
area, laundry area, home office center, or a media center.  
• A primary cleanup sink center houses a recycling center, dish-  
washer, and food waste disposer.  
• The secondary sink center may serve cleanup functions as well,  
but is generally associated with a food preparation center.  
• A preparation center is a long, uninterrupted counter that may  
be placed between the sink and the cooking surface or the sink  
and the refrigerator. In a kitchen for multiple cooks, there will  
be more than one preparation area.  
• A cooking center revolves around the cooking surface. A sepa-  
rate built-in oven need not be a part of this center unless it  
includes a microwave oven.  
• A microwave oven should be located close to the major areas of  
activity because of frequency of use.  
• A pantry center for storing foodstuffs, including storage cabine-  
try from floor to soffit or floor to ceiling, should be located near  
the preparation area.  
• The L-shaped kitchen with work centers on two adjacent walls  
forms a natural triangle that allows traffic to pass by the work  
area. The L shape gives the cook a generous amount of continu-  
ous counter space. If an L shape is combined with a freestanding  
central structure, all of the benefits of a U-shaped kitchen are  
available, with a more open, free-flowing plan. The island invites  
interaction between the cook and visitors and helpers because  
more than one person can work around this open counter.  
• A corridor kitchen offers one cook the advantage of an efficient,  
close grouping of work centers on parallel walls. Disadvantages  
are that household traffic may cross back and forth through the  
area and that the shape is typically too small for two cooks. The  
single-wall kitchen type is only acceptable in small apartments  
or efficiency units.  
The work triangle is the shortest walking distance between the  
refrigerator, primary food prep sink, and primary cooking surface,  
and is measured from the center front of each. Walkways and  
traffic patterns should not interfere with the primary work trian-  
gle, and cabinetry should not intersect any one triangle leg by  
more than 12 in. Each leg of a triangle length should be between  
4 and 9 ft., and the total sum of the three legs should equal less  
than 26 ft.  
Kitchen layouts may be customized to suit the needs of each user,  
thus endless variations are possible.  
• The U-shaped kitchen is usually considered the most efficient  
plan. In it, steps are saved because the cook is surrounded on  
three sides with a continuous countertop and storage system.  
Traffic is also naturally directed around the work area.

Walkways are passages between vertical objects that are greater  
than 24 in. deep in the direction of travel, of which not more than  
one is a work counter or appliance. Walkways should be at least  
36 in. wide and should not cross through the work triangle.  
Range hoods vent through filters back into the room \(self-venting\),  
or through ducts and filters to the outdoors. Accessories such as  
fans, filters, and lights vary greatly in design configuration. Some  
ranges and cooktops are equipped with downdraft venting, which  
may eliminate the need for an overhead range hood. Fans typically  
vent from 50 to 350 CFM of air for standard residential cooktop  
use. For commercial ranges, consult a design professional for CFM  
requirements.  
Do not place dishwasher farther than 10 ft. from sink, typically, for  
proper drainage.  
Freestanding ranges/ovens may have front-mounted controls; if  
so, the backsplash area may be eliminated.

where\:  
Ws = Average seat width in inches  
T = Row-to-row spacing \(tread\) in inches  
I = Average aisle width in inches \(42-in. width,

Savg = Average number of seats in a row per single  
aisle\: 8 or fewer—inefficient layout; 14 to  
16—maximum efficiency \(multiple-aisle seating\);  
18 to 50 and more—continental seating.  
Consult local codes for required minimum row spacing. Codes  
typically stipulate a minimum clear plumb line distance measured  
between the unoccupied chair and the rear of the back of the chair  
in front, as follows\:  
32 to 33 in.\: Typical minimum for multiple-aisle seating.  
34 to 37 in.\: Typical minimum for modified continental seating.  
38 to 42 in.\: Typical minimum for continental seating.  
In performance halls used for concerts, the stage and audience seat-  
ing area should be treated as one volume. In multiple-use halls, this  
is achieved with a hard orchestra shell, which must be demountable  
to allow for full use of the stage for scenery and stage sets. Acoustic  
requirements may dictate that reflective surfaces at the ceiling of the  
orchestra enclosure extend out above audience seating.  
The equation for determining seating capacity and audience area is\:  
Audience area = capacity × efficiency  
Minimum seat row spacing reduces maximum distance to stage.  
Guidelines for enough legroom to provide seated comfort are as  
follows\:  
32 in.\: Knees will touch chair back—uncomfortable.  
34 in.\: Minimum spacing for comfort.  
36 in.\: Ideal spacing for maximum comfort.  
38 in. and greater\: Audience cohesiveness may suffer.  
The floor area efficiency in square feet per seat is a function of the  
row spacing, the average chair width, and the space allocation per  
seat for aisles, as shown in this equation\:  
Efficiency \(F\) = seat factor + aisle factor  
F \[sq. ft./seat\] = \(WsT\) ÷ \(144\) + \(IT\) ÷ \(144\) \(1\) ÷ \(Savg\)  
Guidelines for spacing seats to provide comfortable passage in  
front of seated patrons are as follows\:  
32 to 34 in.\: Seated person must rise to allow passage.

Stage curtains may be categorized as these types\:  
Rigging systems control the movement of scenery and stage cur-  
tain elements in theaters. Counterweight and motorized rigging  
systems are available for a wide range of applications, from ele-  
mentary schools to professional theaters. Rigging systems are  
designed based on the performance programming and the skill  
level of the people operating them.  
Modular, demountable stage platforms are available for multiple  
applications. Mobile stage equipment is generally manufactured in  
4-ft by 8-ft sections in height, ranging from 8 to 32 in., with a wide  
variety of finish flooring. Folding mechanisms and transport  
arrangements \(mobile systems self-transport\) vary with manufac-  
turer. Portable stage and riser systems are available on a 3-ft or  
4-ft by 6-ft or 8-ft modules, for flat-floor or tiered arrangements.  
Stair units and guardrails, and dollies or caddies for transport are  
available as accessory components. Heights for tiered arrange-  
ments are generally based on 8-in. increments, and can extend to  
heights of 72 in. or more. Portable stage equipment should be  
adaptable to provide accessibility, as required.

The Architectural Woodwork Institute \(AWI\) Quality Standards  
classify architectural cabinets in three categories\: premium, cus-  
tom, and economy. The materials, joinery, and finish quality are  
delineated for casework shops to follow.  
• Premium is the highest grade, with close tolerances reserved  
for only the finest cabinets.  
• Custom-grade cabinets, the most common, are made from very  
good materials with durable joinery.  
• Economy-grade cabinets are used for utilitarian and inexpensive  
residential cabinets.  
The AWI Quality Standards further classify cabinet parts as exposed,  
semi-exposed, and concealed, and specify a minimum grade for  
each. The finish to be used is specified as paint grade or stain grade,  
or whether plastic laminate or other material will be used.  
To prevent movement caused by wood shrinkage, use only kiln-  
dried solid lumber or panel product for base supports.  
Flush overlay construction offers a clean, contemporary design  
because only the doors and drawer fronts are visible in elevation.  
The grain between doors and drawer fronts can be matched by  
cutting all pieces from the same panel. This cabinet style lends  
itself well to the use of plastic laminate for exposed surfaces.  
Conventional and concealed hinges are available for a variety of  
door thickness. Door and drawer joinery and materials may vary  
from the selection shown in the details.  
In this style of cabinet construction, the separation between doors  
and drawer fronts is accented by the reveal. The style is suited  
equally to either wood or plastic laminate construction. Figure  
14.86 indicates a reveal at vertical and horizontal joints, but the  
designer may vary this arrangement.  
A reveal wider than 1/2 in. requires the addition of a face frame,  
which would change the hinge requirements. With or without a face  
frame, this style allows the use of conventional or concealed

hinges. Door/drawer joinery and materials may vary from selec-  
tions shown Figure 14.86.  
In this style of construction, all door and drawer faces are flush  
with the face of the cabinet. This style allows the use of door and  
drawer fronts with different thicknesses.  
Conventional as well as concealed hinges are available for a vari-  
ety of door thicknesses. The material chosen for the case and  
doors and drawers influences the choice of hinges. In general,  
avoid conventional butt hinges when hinge screws would be  
attached to the edge grain of panel products.  
Flush inset construction without any face frame is generally an  
expensive style, because increased care is necessary to fit and  
align the doors and drawers. The design features of this casework  
style are the same as for conventional flush construction with face  
frame, except that, here, the face frame has been eliminated.  
This style does not lend itself to the economical use of plastic  
laminate covering finishes. Door/drawer joinery and materials may  
vary from those shown in Figure 14.87.

Self-closing hinges spring-close the cabinet door when it is within  
28° of being closed. When it is opened beyond 30°, the self-closer  
does not function, allowing the door to be left open. The self-clos-

The dining rooms and bars in restaurants must be efficiently  
planned to optimize revenue. Upscale restaurants generally  
require more space between tables for privacy. The restaurant  
concept, menu, and operation style also influence space allocation.  
Depending on the type of restaurant and menu, kitchen areas  
range from 30 to 45 percent of the total restaurant area.  
Building codes identify restaurants as assembly spaces. Comply  
with local code requirements for construction, including plumbing  
fixture counts.  
The local department of health reviews restaurants for compliance  
with regulations for general sanitation in food handling and proper  
food storage.  
Dimensions shown in Figure 14.100 are minimum clearances, and  
seating layouts indicate general configurations; they are not  
intended to depict any specific type of operation. Tables may be  
converted from square to round to enlarge seating capacity. Booth  
seating makes effective use of corner space. An accessible route,  
at least 36 in. wide, is required to connect the entrance, accessible  
fixed seating, and restrooms.

Restaurant patrons typically form their first impression of a res-  
taurant from the main dining room and bar areas. The restaurant  
concept may offer a variety of space types, including open or mul-  
tilevel dining areas, secluded alcoves, private dining rooms, or  
features such as display cooking areas. A mix of seating and table  
types, adequate aisle and serving areas, and well-chosen materi-  
als and lighting combine to create a comfortable, inviting dining  
environment.

Integrate 5 percent accessible seating allocation, distributed  
among various seating types, to accommodate both large and  
small groups. Consult codes, standards, and regulations for spe-  
cific requirements for accessible seating and distribution. Tables,  
which should have rounded ends, are often 2 in. shorter than the  
booth seating.  
Flexibility in dining spaces is an asset. Private dining and com-  
partmentalization of the main dining areas provide a means of  
accommodating large or small groups of diners without disrupting  
the general dining area.  
Bar areas may be open to the dining area or separate, possibly  
with a different design aesthetic from the main dining area. Hours  
of use, smoking areas \(if allowed\), and acoustics influence the  
location and adjacency of the bar to the dining area.

Waitstaff service stations are located between the front of the  
house and the back of the house. Service stations are typically  
furnished with equipment, supplies, and selected beverages.  
Many service stations include a point-of-service \(POS\) terminal to  
calculate patron bills and process credit card receipts, depending  
on the operations preference of the restaurant owner. The size  
and configuration of the space may determine the number of  
waitstaff stations/POS terminals.  
Banquettes can be used to provide comfortable, flexible seating  
arrangements and to serve as mid-height privacy screens. The  
table size mix can vary at banquette areas by locating tables next  
to one another or separately. Two tops, for example, can be com-  
bined to create a table for four or more diners. Booths are desir-  
able for comfort, privacy, and intimacy.  
Note that booth sizes may be determined by local building codes.

The design of restaurant counter service areas must allow for  
adequate workspace clearance behind the counter. The clearance  
from the top of the seat to the underside of the countertop and the  
depth of the countertop overhang are critical. Often, footrests that  
are applied to the counter are located such that the patron’s leg is  
not supported; it is more likely to be successful for seated patrons  
when the footrest is integral to the stool. Standing patrons will often  
use the counter-mounted footrest. Footrests prevent accessibility,  
and should not be included at accessible portions of counters.

When planning the furnishing of office spaces, use these guidelines\:  
• The standard height for surfaces in an office is 28 to 30 in.  
• The standard height for work surfaces that will accommodate a  
computer and/or a keyboard ranges from 25 to 30 in. Keyboards  
can be accommodated on a work surface either by lowering the  
work surface or installing an articulating keyboard arm under a  
standard-height work surface.  
• Work surface depths typically range from 18 to 45 in., depending  
on the type and size of work being completed\: 18 in. is used for  
storage, 30 in. is the standard desk depth, and 45 in. is used to  
accommodate conferencing.  
• Occasionally, an office must accommodate stand-up work sur-  
faces. The height of the work surfaces range from 36 to 52 in.  
• Overhead storage above a work surface is standard, with 15- to  
18-in. clearance.  
• Knee space is integral to the use of desks, tables, and worksta-  
tions. To serve wheelchair users, knee space with a clear height  
of approximately 2 ft-3 in. is sufficient.

therefore rooms in a high-rise office building may be organized  
near elevator banks on crossover floors for ease of access by  
many users. When a conference room functions as a flexible space,  
the location of entry/exit doors is positioned so that acoustic fold-

Follow these guidelines for designing conference and training  
Conference room table size and configuration influence the room  
size as well as the comfort of the occupants. A typical standard  
table size that can be used in most conference rooms improves  
efficiency in room layout, as well as in furniture storage and  
retrieval.  
Tables in trapezoidal or other shapes permit flexibility in nonstan-  
dard table arrangements, which may be useful for situations such  
as videoconferencing. Modular tables provide greater flexibility in  
room layout than one large table. Consider room usage and quality  
level in determining table types and styles. Large tables should be  
broken into smaller modules for ease of installation.  
Table materials and finishes should reflect the function and quality  
level of the intended conference or training function. High-end  
quality rooms may be appropriate for custom tables of wood,  
stone, and glass. Midlevel conference room and training tables  
should be durable and comfortable, offer the appropriate features,  
and be cost-effective and easy to store.  
• Tabletop finishes can include plastic laminate, linoleum, wood  
veneer, and other materials.  
• Edge materials, including wood, rubber, and leather, provide  
additional protection and/or comfort.  
• Beveled and eased table edges provide greater comfort than  
squared edges, and are less subject to edge damage.  
• Table edges that are beveled on the underside provide more  
room for chair arms.  
tables\:  
• The optimum dimension for each occupant is 30 in., which allows  
for an average-size chair and space between occupants, without  
straddling table legs.  
• A common table length for two persons is 60 in.  
• The typical training table size is 30 in. wide, 60 in. long, and 29  
in. high.  
• Accessible heights should be 28 in. minimum to 34 in. maximum,  
with knee and toe clearance.  
• Accessible tables may require special bases for clearance of a  
wheelchair.  
• Table width should enable occupants to work comfortably and  
have reference space. A common minimum width is 24 in. A  
30-in. or greater width can be used if space and function permits  
and if people are seated across from one another.  
• Table bases should be stable, preferably with bearer bars.  
• Folding or flip-top tables offer flexibility in room layout and  
usage.  
• Tabletop or recessed power options include plug-in or hardwired  
capabilities with wire management for Local Area Network  
\(LAN\), power, and telephone.  
• For computer usage, consider recessed computer monitors in  
special tables to improve sight lines.

Lounge seating is typically used in commercial interiors for waiting  
areas, lounges, and similar spaces. Sofas, love seats, lounge  
chairs, pull-up chairs, tables, and consoles comprise the typical  
furnishings. Each component is available in a wide variety of styles,  
shapes, and sizes, with a multitude of material and fabric options.  
This product differs from its residential counterpart in its increased  
durability and compliance with fire codes. Furniture arrangements,  
their related spatial requirements and individual furnishing dimen-  
sions indicated in Figures 14.112 through 14.119 are for prelimi-  
nary design purposes; dimensions capture typical size ranges.  
Consult manufacturers for specific options and dimensions. The  
choice of lounge furniture will depend upon the space available  
\(obviously, larger spaces allow for larger furniture\); flooring mate-  
rials \(hard-surface materials that are maintained with wet mopping  
dictate furniture that does not have upholstery touching the floor\);  
and the composition of the users. Specialty lounge furniture prod-  
ucts are available to address the particular needs of special popu-  
lations\: elderly, obese \(bariatric seating\), and college \(dormitory\)  
are a few examples of such products.  
• For ambulatory people who have difficulty maintaining their bal-  
ance, chairs should be stable, to provide support.  
• Chairs equipped with armrests help ambulatory users to sit and  
rise, and are generally more comfortable.  
• Wheelchair users who transfer diagonally can use chairs with  
armrests.  
• People who transfer from a parallel position must have clear  
side access, which is offered by chairs without fixed armrests.  
• Chair leg supports and cross-bracing should not obstruct kick  
space below the seat. Kick space allows chair occupants to posi-  
tion their feet partially beneath the body in order to rise.

For wheelchair users who can independently transfer themselves  
between bed and chair, bed heights should facilitate their move-

these users if the mattress top approximately matches their  
wheelchair seat height \(typically, 18 to 20 in.\). Wheelchair users  
who cannot independently transfer themselves between bed and

• Introduce a variety of social settings for small and large groups.  
• Make strong connections between the indoors and the outdoors;  
use daylighting as much as possible.  
• Connect spaces to promote communication, orientation, and

quiet reading and writing. Other activities such as sand play and  
woodworking are also often accommodated. Soft spaces as well as  
hard surfaces, such as wood floors and ample crawling and tod-  
dling areas, are typically provided for infants and young toddlers.  
Sturdy furniture is required to enable nonwalkers to pull them-  
selves up or balance themselves while walking. School-age chil-  
dren should be provided separate space that is arranged to facili-

The design of schools for early childhood education has always  
been geared toward comfortable, supportive, and adaptive settings  
that are conducive to a learning process derived from familiar play  
and hands-on activities. Specific features associated with home as  
well as school are considered in developing an appropriate transi-  
tional setting. The type, size, scale, and variety of more public and  
private spaces underlie appropriate design and planning.  
Among the general goals that all early childhood and kindergarten  
programs should strive to achieve are the following\:  
• Create a visually rich, fun, and surprising environment.  
• Provide spaces and surfaces for display of children’s work.  
• Provide a variety of settings for work-in-progress.  
Private areas should be made available indoors and outdoors so  
that children can have occasional solitude. Soft elements such as  
rugs, cushions, or rocking chairs should be provided for the com-  
fort of the children, in addition to sound-absorbing materials to  
minimize noise.  
Age-appropriate materials and equipment of sufficient quantity,  
variety, and durability should be readily accessible to children and  
be arranged on low, open shelves to promote independent use.  
Individual spaces for children to store their personal belongings  
should be provided.  
The work environment for staff should include a place for adults to  
take a break or work away from children, an adult-size bathroom,  
a secure place for staff to store their personal belongings, and an  
administrative area that is separated from the children’s areas for  
planning or preparing materials.  
The space for children three years and older should be arranged to  
facilitate a variety of small group and individual activities, including  
block-building, sociodramatic play, art, music, science, math, and  
This classroom accommodates a variety of group and individual activities, with specific areas for instruction, group reading, wet projects,  
and small groups.  
For general-purpose classrooms, it is common to size rooms for  
approximately 28 students though most schools attempt to keep  
the number of students per classroom lower, usually 22 to 24  
students.  
Classroom sizes typically range from 750 to 1,000 net sq. ft.  
Adequate space must be allowed for classroom materials and  
student storage. Storage should be sized for coats, briefcases,  
purses, backpacks, and other paraphernalia. Most elementary  
schools do not have lockers in corridors, so storage areas must be  
accommodated within the classroom.  
Many states have minimum standards for classroom size, so con-  
sult local requirements.

include large common areas that have been developed to offer  
flexible and multifunction opportunities within the same space. The  
gymnasium, auditorium, and cafeteria are combined in some fash-  
ion \(sometimes for two of these functions only\).  
Classrooms are planned to have integrated technology available in a variety of configurations, to enable simulations research and stream-  
ing videos. Small group rooms are designed as breakout areas for the shared use of the middle school.

High schools are dedicated to the concept of group instruction with an  
emphasis on the importance of individual learning. Many campuses are  
considered “open,” allowing students to move freely on and off cam-  
pus and to have flexible scheduling of classes and independent studies.  
Many courses of study are offered, thus creating the need for more  
specialized rooms and, often, requiring larger, more flexible spaces.  
The design objective for general-use classrooms should be to  
assist students to clearly see and hear any presentation. Therefore,  
special attention should be given to angles of view to the display  
wall or the projected image.  
The integration of electronic media, especially overhead projectors  
and networked resources, has supplemented the traditional tools  
of the chalkboard and tablet-armchair, but has also presented new  
challenges for planning classrooms.  
A heightened emphasis on teaching methodologies that stress  
discussion and interaction has created the need for furniture  
arrangements that are more flexible than traditional lecture-  
format row seating. Loose chairs and tables can be reconfigured  
for both discussion-style rooms and for lecture formats. Both  
table-and-chair and tablet-armchair arrangements are used.  
Similarly, the need to accommodate students’ laptops and other  
mobile technologies has increased the need for individual student  
workspace areas in both situations.  
Planning issues vary according to the size of the room. As the capac-  
ity increases, it becomes more reasonable to build fixed-furniture  
configurations. Smaller classrooms may be reconfigured more easily.  
To plan a successful classroom, pay special attention to integrating  
various critical interrelated components, including\:  
Acoustics\: The basic purpose of a classroom is clear communica-  
tion; to that end, limit background noise, isolate sound between  
rooms, and accommodate appropriate reverberation time.  
Audio/visual technology\: Provision of a networked projector,  
along with the ability to control it from a wired lectern, is a basic  
level of media integration.  
Display media writing and projection surfaces\: These should  
cover as much of the teaching walls as is economically and  
spatially feasible.  
Furniture\: The ability to reconfigure loose furniture makes it  
possible to use the same room for different modes of learning—  
lectures, discussions, seminars, and small-group activities.

Round tables are not recommended for research purposes, but they may be desired in a staff room or in an area designed for light  
reading.  
Libraries now link digital information, paper information, resourc-  
es, and print collections. Consequently, libraries are now places  
where people not only read and borrow books but also use comput-  
ers to find information and access online services. Traditional  
library furnishings for accommodating printed volumes range from  
13–1/2 to 19 books per square foot, with the average of 16 books  
per square foot of gross area. The average additional dead load is  
25-lb/cu ft.

Specific furniture designed for library use, includes library tables,  
shelves, carrels, card catalogs, and so on. Specialized furniture  
may include dictionary stands, atlas cases, book trucks, display  
cases, and the like.  
Design guidelines for workspaces include the following\:  
• About 5 percent of fixed tables and carrels should be accessible.  
• Reading tables and study carrels often should incorporate  
power outlets and, possibly, Internet connections.  
• Reading tables and study carrels should be sized large enough  
so that library patrons can spread out their materials, particu-  
larly in areas where oversized materials are viewed.  
• The recommended height of study carrel partitions is at least  
52 in. above the floor.  
• Tables or podiums with slanted tops should be provided for  
more convenient reading of oversized materials or newspapers.  
• Seating guidelines are as follows\:  
• Comfortable seating, such as upholstered chairs and sofas, is  
generally best for informal reading or lounge areas.  
• Pull-up chairs with metal or wood arms are typically used at  
reading tables and carrels.  
• Mechanically adjustable chairs are rarely selected for librar-  
ies because they are subject to heavy use and frequent  
maintenance.

# ELEMENT E\: EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS FURNISHINGS  
There are two basic types of systems furniture\: panel-supported  
and freestanding systems. Many manufacturers offer systems that  
combine freestanding components with traditional panel-supported  
units. These systems provide flexibility and function for workplace  
tasks. High-tech designs, as well as more conservative assemblies,  
are available.  
Systems furniture is available that addresses the total workplace  
environment, using walls, panels, post-and-beam construction,  
work surfaces, filing, storage, raised-floor platforms for wiring and  
cabling, and other flexible elements. Often systems furniture prod-  
ucts are compatible and may be interchangeable with other prod-  
ucts from the same manufacturer, allowing greater flexibility.  
Panel-supported systems, the most popular type of systems furni-  
ture, support the work surfaces, accessories, and other furniture  
components from panels that form the boundaries of the worksta-  
tion. Wall-mounted slotted standards are also available so that  
these systems can be hung on a traditional gypsum board wall. The  
Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer’s Association  
\(BIFMA\) has authored a standard for panel-based systems furni-  
ture; and ANSI X5.6, “Standard for Office Furnishings Panel  
Systems,” is used to test the safety of panels and panel-mounted  
components.  
Freestanding systems are independent of surrounding panels, and  
function like floor-supported desks. Furniture components can be  
attached to the work surface or may be freestanding mobile units.  
This type of systems furniture can be surrounded by panels, or  
installed in a space with gypsum board walls. New systems furni-  
ture types are being developed that integrate technology to the  
design of the furniture, such as post-and-beam products.

Different table sizes and shapes offer variety in seating arrange-  
ments. Table sizes are known as tops \(two-top, four-top, etc.\) and  
reflect the number of seats at that table type. The mix of table sizes  
is dependent on the target clientele, menu, and general opera-  
tional goals. The opinions of designers and restaurateurs vary as  
to what are the ideal dimensions for restaurant chairs and tables.  
Factors including circulation, service, egress, and space dimen-  
sions should dictate optimal table and chair dimensions.  
Table options include flip-up corners or edges, to increase table  
size or to change shape \(e.g., square table to a round table\).  
Chair selections reflect the type of comfort level desired\: a fast-food  
restaurant may provide hard-surface chairs and non-upholstered  
seats to discourage lingering, whereas a full-service restaurant  
may provide comfortable, upholstered dining chairs.  
• Refer to local codes for restrictions and requirements.  
• Provide an accessible route to accessible seating, 36 to 44 in.  
wide.  
• For wall seating, allow 30 in. minimum between walls and table.  
• Provide clear floor space for table access. Such clear floor  
space cannot overlap knee space by more than 19 in.  
• Consider restaurant type when designing table layouts; gener-  
ally, upscale restaurants have more generous table spacing than  
casual, full-service restaurants.  
• The tops of accessible tables should be 28 to 34 in. high. A por-  
table raised leaf may be provided to adapt lower tables.  
• If seating for people in wheelchairs is provided at tables, knee  
space at least 27 in. high, 30 in. wide, and 19 in. deep must be  
provided.

• For square seating, allow 72 in. minimum between tables \(30-in.  
aisle, plus two chairs back to back\).  
• For diagonal seating, allow 36 in. minimum between corners of  
tables.  
• For wall seating, allow 30 in. minimum between wall and seat  
back.  
• Allow a minimum of 30 in. for bus cart and service cart access.  
• Accessible seating should be integrated within the dining area,  
and should accommodate both large and small groups.  
• Chair seat height is usually 18 in. Seat heights should be slightly  
higher at accessible tables.  
• Seats should be a minimum of 16 in. deep and 16 in. wide.  
• Padding and cushions should be firm.  
• Armrests aid diners in rising from the seat.  
• Table or counter supports should not interfere with seat knee  
space so the feet can be positioned for rising.

# ELEMENT F\: SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION MANUFACTURED—FABRICATED ROOMS  
# MANUFACTURED—FABRICATED ROOMS  
Isolated rooms incorporate special construction to reduce intru-  
sive noise and vibration from outside a room or to contain the  
sound and impact energy generated within a room. Typical applica-  
tions include music practice rooms, sound studios, testing cham-  
bers, mechanical equipment rooms near sensitive areas, spaces  
exposed to low flying aircraft, and offices under gymnasiums.  
Construction of isolated rooms can be very expensive; it is, there-  
fore, wise to locate high-noise sources away from acoustically  
critical areas early in space planning.  
The correct design of an isolated room is a “box within a box.”  
The inner box, which is the four walls, ceiling, and floor of the  
isolated room, should be an airtight enclosure constructed of  
dense, impervious materials; depending on the requirements it  
may be necessary to also isolate the box on resilient supports  
from the surrounding structure. The base structure that supports  
the isolated room must be as rigid and massive as possible.  
The most effective floor construction is a floating concrete slab,  
which is separated from the building structure by steel springs,  
neoprene, or glass-fiber isolation mounts. This slab should also  
support the inner walls of the room. Any necessary structural brac-  
ing to the base building structure should be made with a resilient,  
nonrigid connection. The ceiling of the box can be suspended from  
resilient hangers, or supported from the walls of the inner box.  
An isolation mat provides uniform deflection of the floating con-  
crete floor under a wide range of design loads. It consists of 2-in.-  
thick, high-density, compressed molded fiberglass isolation pads,  
separated by low-density acoustic fiberglass.  
Avoid flanking \(continuous\) paths between an isolated room and  
the base building structure. To ensure that wall penetrations and  
connections to facility services are also isolated, provide flexible  
connections in ducts and conduit between the inner and outer box,  
and resilient supports for all piping. Weatherstripped or sound-  
rated doors and multiple-glazed, acoustic windows should be part  
of the continuous, airtight enclosure that defines the inner box.

• The degree of noise reduction that can be attained by an iso-  
lated room depends on the type of construction, its resiliency,  
the elimination of flanking paths, and the amount of dead air  
space surrounding the inner box. A well-built isolated room can  
achieve field performance ratings between STC 60 and STC 70  
for airborne sound, and ratings of IIC 80 to 90 for impact noise.  
However, even minor flanking paths and acoustic short circuits  
through nonairtight joints can easily decrease these results by  
10 points or more. The sound isolation between spaces will be  
only as great as the weakest sound path.  
• Consult a qualified acoustic consultant for the planning and  
design of isolated rooms.  
Softwoods such as western red cedar and redwood are used for  
wall finishes and bench construction in a sauna. Softwoods absorb  
humidity, keeping the atmosphere dry, and do not absorb heat as  
readily as hardwoods, keeping the surface comfortable to the  
touch. Wood should be kiln-dried to between 6 and 11 percent  
moisture content.  
In private saunas, a water bucket and dipper for creating a burst  
of steam are common accessories. These are often not provided in  
public saunas, to prevent misuse by unknowledgeable bathers, as  
premature or excessive water application can damage heater  
parts.  
In addition to the site-constructed sound-condition rooms, fabri-  
cated units are available. These rooms are sold as self-contained  
music practice rooms, audiometric booths, and control booths for  
manufacturing plants. Although the detailing of these structures is  
proprietary, the design approach is the same as with site con-  
structed rooms. The degree of noise reduction that these manufac-  
tured rooms can attain depends on the same parameters used for  
site-constructed rooms.  
If the sauna framing does not extend to the ceiling of the room  
outside the sauna, an exterior finish that encloses the top of the  
sauna is recommended.  
A 1-in. gap is recommended between the bottom of the door and  
the threshold for ventilation.  
Wood-framed baseplates should be made of preservative-treated  
wood; all other framing may be standard wood framing. Metal  
framing is not recommended because of its high heat-conductance  
property.  
A sauna is a dry heat bath taken in a well-insulated room lined with  
untreated, kiln-dried softwood, and heated by igneous rocks. The  
purpose of the sauna is to induce perspiration, which cleanses the  
pores in the skin by removing impurities and lactic acid built up  
from physical exertion.  
Because of the dryness of the air in a sauna \(25 percent humidity,  
average\), the body can accept the higher temperatures a sauna  
produces \(180˚F, average\). It is usually better to lie down than to  
sit up in a sauna, for the temperature rises about 18˚F for every  
foot above the floor level. If a bather is lying down, the heat is  
equally dispensed over the entire body. Saunas should be located  
near a shower for the cool-down portion of the sauna.  
Saunas may be fabricated \(precut pieces assembled on-site\),  
modular \(factory-built complete panels joined on-site\), or custom  
built.  
Steam bathing \(discussed in further detail below\) has effects simi-  
lar to the sauna, but in a very different climate. Unlike the dry heat  
of a sauna, a steam bath \(or Roman bath\) is taken in a warm, moist  
atmosphere with temperatures up to 125˚F and humidity near  
100 percent. As with the sauna, the critical factor in steam bathing  
is the bather’s interaction between heat and cold.  
A sauna suite offers a complete heating and cooling cycle with  
indoor and outdoor cooling areas.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
The larger the sauna, the more heat is required; hence, the ceiling  
should be kept as low as possible within the limits imposed by the  
benches, which generally require 7 ft. clear height. Refer to local  
code requirements. A 24-in.-wide, 80-in.-high nonlockable door that  
opens outward is standard in a sauna. This door size maximizes  
bench space, minimizes heat loss, and provides safe entrance.  
A 36-in.-wide door could make a design compatible with accessibil-  
ity guidelines, but wheelchair access is discouraged, to protect the  
metal and plastic components of a wheelchair from excessive heat.  
Instead, an attendant can assist wheelchair-bound sauna users  
\(liability and safety issues should be considered\). Because of the  
weight of the door, a pair of 4-in. brass hinges with ball bearings is  
recommended. A heavy ball or roller catch keeps the door closed.  
Door handles are typically made of wood or other nonconductive  
material.  
Indirect lighting is recommended in a sauna. The best position for  
the light is above and slightly behind the bather’s normal field of  
view; the switch is always outside the room.  
The tongue-and-groove boards used for interior finishes should be  
at least 5/8-in. thick but no wider than six times their thickness.  
Blind-nailing with galvanized, aluminum, or stainless steel nails is  
recommended.  
Vapor retarders under paneling, whether attached to the insulation  
or separate, must be vapor proof and heat-resistant and act as a  
heat reflectant. Foil-backed, mineral-based insulation, R-11 mini-  
mum, is recommended.  
Air must be able to flow freely into and out of a sauna and should  
be changed four to six times per hour. Fresh air is provided through  
updraft action by combining an air inlet in the sauna wall directly  
below the heater, with an air outlet located at least 6 in. from the  
ceiling and 24 in. higher than the inlet. A vent space below the door  
may also be used.  
15.3 Resilient hangers typically are used to isolate duct vibration. Sway  
braces prevent buckling or overturning of tall or extremely long walls.

Avoid the use of exposed, untreated materials that are subject to  
decay or corrosion.  
Steam room ceilings should be sloped a minimum of 2 in./ft. to  
prevent condensation from collecting and dripping. Sloping from  
the middle to the edges reduces the height necessary to accom-  
plish this. The ceiling should be no more than 8 ft. high.  
Use of vents inside the steam room is not recommended, but if they  
are installed, they must be positive closing with a vapor-tight seal  
and waterproof ducts.  
Flooring should be skid-resistant, with a floor drain for condensa-  
tion runoff and cleaning.  
The steam generator must be compatible with the finish materials  
and the volume of the steam room. Residential steam generators  
can handle 50 to 500 cu ft., and larger models can service up to  
1500 cu ft. Controls for the generator may be located inside or  
outside the room. The dimensions of the generator range from 13  
to 17 in. high, 12 to 16 in. deep, and 7 to 8 in. wide.  
The walls, ceiling, floor, and benches in a steam room must be  
completely covered with a waterproof finish such as tile, marble,  
or acrylic. Exposed gypsum board or plaster is not recommended.  
All joints must be filled with waterproof sealant.

Precast concrete modular vault panels are considerably lighter and  
thinner than site-poured walls, and provide almost unlimited flexi-  
bility when sizing or locating a vault. Modular vaults can be  
expanded or relocated as required, reusing existing components.  
Vault panels are typically fabricated from a high-density composite  
concrete mix with interlacing steel fibers and a welded grid of  
reinforcement bars. Although manufacturers provide standard  
vault sizes and configurations, a modular vault design can be  
custom-fabricated.  
Clear spans of up to 19 ft., without the use of support beams, can  
be achieved by most modular vault systems, simplifying above-  
ground installations.  
Engineered panels are site-assembled, typically by welding.  
Modular vault panels can be disassembled and moved to another  
location. Existing vaults can be increased or reduced in size by

adding or removing panels. Typically, the interior and exterior fin-  
ishes of the vault are the responsibility of the owner.  
Conduit penetrations for alarm and other electrical connections  
are cast into the vault panels. Electrical and security wiring are  
typically included in a single panel that can be placed almost any-  
where within the vault design. HVAC ports with built-in dampers  
can be specified to provide ductwork, to maintain a comfortable  
environment for vaults that are used as workspaces.  
Two types of vaults are used to protect valuables\: burglary-resistant  
and fire-resistant.  
Underwriter’s Laboratories \(UL\) and Insurance Services Offices  
\(ISO\) provide criteria by which the security performance of a vault  
can be evaluated.  
UL performs attack tests on the modular vault systems to ensure  
that minimum requirements for burglary resistance are met. UL  
608, “Standard for Burglary-Resistant Vault Doors and Modular  
Panels,” classifies vault doors and modular panels by the approxi-  
mate time it takes to break through the assembly. Test methods  
used to penetrate the door include expert burglary attack using  
cutting torches, fluxing rods, portable electric-powered tools, por-  
table hydraulic tools, and common hand tools. The ratings are as  
follows\:  
• Class M\: One-quarter hour  
• Class 1\: One-half hour  
• Class 2\: One hour  
• Class 3\: Two hours  
ISO, an organization supported by insurance companies, provides  
a consistent basis for setting standards and rates used in calculat-  
ing insurance costs. It has developed a system for rating security  
devices, including vaults. Although there are technical differences  
between the UL and the ISO standards, certain classifications can  
be considered comparable.  
Fire-resistant vaults are used primarily to protect vital records.

# ELEMENT F\: SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION SPECIAL STRUCTURES  
# SPECIAL STRUCTURES  
There are two types of nonpneumatic fabric structures. One supports  
the fabric membrane with a rigid frame, usually constructed of metal,  
the other is a self-supporting fabric membrane kept in tension with a  
supporting structure of steel or concrete. The rigid frame structures  
typically form pyramidal or long, continuous geometric shapes like  
sheds or barrel vaults. The self-supporting structures rely on oppos-  
ing curves to distribute the necessary tension and typically form  
saddle, conical, or hyperboloid \(anticlastic\) shapes.  
The structure that creates and maintains tension on the fabric can  
consist of cables and masts, a compression ring, trussed gridwork,  
or tied edges. These mechanisms create tension in the fabric suf-  
ficient to keep it taut. Any compressive loads imposed on the fabric  
will be balanced or, at most, reduced by the prestress created by  
the structure.  
F  
The intended life span of the structure is an important factor in  
design decisions, fabrication details, and the cost of architectural  
fabric structures. The life span is most affected by the fabric  
material or membrane selected. Fabric is a directional material  
and does not have the same strength or elongation in all direc-  
tions under a load. Materials with little creep are preferable for  
tensioned structures, as original prestress can be lost if the fab-  
ric stretches or deforms. Details allowing for retensioning must  
be incorporated if materials with moderate to high creep are  
used. Generally, the materials used in a membrane are compos-  
ites consisting of a woven substrate protected with an applied  
coating.  
The membrane is the principal structural component of a self-  
supporting or tensioned fabric structure. Two materials are gener-  
ally used for membranes\: polyvinyl chloride \(PVC\)-coated materials  
and fluorocarbon- \(Teflon-\) coated glass-fiber fabric.  
PVC-coated polyester is a composite material composed of vinyl  
coating over both faces of a woven polyester fabric. The material  
is inexpensive, strong, translucent, and easy to fabricate, but has  
a limited life span and is only fire-resistant. For these reasons, it  
is used only in temporary or semipermanent structures.  
Fluorocarbon-coated glass-fiber fabric is classified as a noncom-  
bustible material. Besides its advantages in fire safety, this  
fabric is extremely long-lasting, self-cleaning, and translucent,  
and is the accepted material for most permanent installations.  
Development continues in fabric technology, and new products  
such as silicon-coated glass-fiber may offer an improvement in the  
range of material characteristics.

In recent years, the structural design of fabric structures has  
improved due to the increased use of the computer in the engineering  
process. The first step in the design process aided by computer  
modeling is the definition of an acceptable surface geometry, such as  
the hyperbolic paraboloid. A membrane mesh or network is then  
developed, representing the surface as a grid of lines. This graphic  
model is “prestressed,” and the reactions are analyzed in an itera-  
tive, or repetition-based, process. Live loads such as wind, rain, or  
snow are applied to the model, and the stresses calculated in order  
to select the fabric and design the supporting structure or foundation.  
The design, fabrication, and construction of fabric structures  
require close coordination among the architect, engineer, fabrica-  
tor, and installer throughout the process, to ensure the strict qual-  
ity control this technology requires. However, because most of the  
work is completed in the factory, minimizing on-site construction  
time, it is not unreasonable to maintain tight specifications.

Applications for fabric structures include the semipermanent and  
temporary fabric-and-frame structures applied to agricultural,  
greenhouse, and storage uses. Improved materials have allowed  
the use of these structures for waste treatment facilities, tennis  
courts, and pool facilities. More elaborate configurations, curved in  
plan and section, serve as outdoor concert halls, enclosed sports  
facilities, and atrium spaces for larger structures such as office  
buildings, medical facilities, shopping malls, and airports. Fabric  
structures are not substitutes for conventional construction, but  
their unique qualities enable them to perform certain building  
tasks very efficiently. In general, special performance require-  
ments, such as the need for long spans or for natural lighting,  
encourage the use of fabric structures.  
Under certain circumstances, a tensioned fabric structure can  
reduce energy consumption in a building. The natural light through  
the translucent surface reduces artificial lighting requirements; the  
reflectivity of the skin reduces heat gain; and the radiation of waste  
heat from the warm fabric surface to a cool sky results in an  
energy-efficient building in warm climates. In cold climates, a sec-  
ond skin or liner is normally used, often with glass-fiber insulation  
in the cavity to further reduce heat loss. These structures can be as  
energy-efficient as conventional buildings in many applications.

# ELEMENT F\: SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION SPECIAL STRUCTURES  
The two primary ways of attaching fabric to anchorages are with  
edge catenary cables or clamps. Catenaries allow free-form  
design. When a tighter connection between fabric and building  
structure is required \(e.g., on roofs, skylights, and air structures\),  
a clamp system is used, in which the fabric is sandwiched between  
clamping bars or plates, which are bolted to the structure. Some  
membrane structures use both kinds of attachment. Air structures  
sometimes have sleeves and cables, plus a fabric closure panel  
that extends beyond the cable.  
Tensile structures usually are custom-designed; anchoring and con-  
nection details also are customized. However, basics, such as  
clamping systems, have become more standardized. Some frame  
and connection materials have been adapted from other industries,  
such as space frames and marine rigging. To determine the appro-  
priate design aesthetic for a project, consider the following aspects\:  
• Tensile structures are flexible, and the details must be designed  
to move under loads.  
• Tensile structures weigh a fraction of the amount of other build-  
ings, and many of the materials are translucent.  
• Lateral forces play a much greater role in tensile structures than  
in conventional structures.  
• It is essential that the physical resolution of each element’s  
force vector \(the angle of direction and magnitude\) be accurate.  
• Details, material specifications, and reaction forces affecting  
interfacing structures should be developed with an engineer or  
fabricator with the expertise in the design of fabric structures.  
Most space frames are designed for specific applications, and a  
structural engineer with specific experience should be consulted.  
Manufacturers can provide the full range of capabilities \(loading,  
spans, shapes, specific details\) for their products. Standardized  
structural assemblies in 4- and 5-ft modules are available.  
Metal space frames are classified as noncombustible construction,  
and can usually be exposed when 20 ft. above the floor. However,  
a fire suppression or a rated ceiling assembly may be required.  
Consult the appropriate codes.  
Common finishes include paint, thermoset polyester, galvanized  
stainless steel, and metal plating.  
A space frame is a three-dimensional truss with linear members  
that form a series of triangulated polyhedrons. It can be seen as a  
plane of constant depth that can sustain fairly long spans and  
varied configurations of shape.  
Prime attributes of space frames include\:  
• Light weight  
• Inherent rigidity  
• Wide variety of form, size, and span  
• Compatible interaction with services, primarily HVAC

Select a space frame module that is compatible with the structural  
module in shape \(e.g., a square module with orthogonal plan\) and  
size \(a multiple of the structural module\), is consistent with the  
limitations of the interfacing systems \(e.g., the maximum span of  
the roof deck or mullion spacing of the glazing system\), and satis-  
fies the spatial and aesthetic effects in scale and form.  
15.18 Many proprietary node systems are available for specific applica-  
tions and budgets. Keep field connections to a minimum; welded con-  
nections often eliminate joint pieces.

# MANUFACTURED ENGINEERED STRUCTURES  
Metal building systems are available in standard framing sizes and  
types from various manufacturers. Commonly used terms in the  
metal building industry include\:  
Bay\: The dimension along a wall between the centerlines of wall  
columns and the dimension from the outside of an end-wall  
corner column to the centerline of the first adjacent wall column.  
Spacings range from 18 to 30 ft., with 20 to 25 ft. most common.  
Width\: Measured from the surface of the outside wall girts. Inside  
clearance varies.  
Eave height\: Measured from the bottom of a wall column to the top  
of an eave strut. Nominal 2-ft increments vary from 10 to 30 ft.  
Diagonal bracing\: Normally required in the plane of the columns  
and beams in one or more bays to prevent racking and to resist  
lateral loading perpendicular to the span of the frames.  
Girts\: Horizontal structural members that transmit lateral loads  
\(pressure and suction\) from the exterior walls to the columns.  
Sag rods may be needed to support the girts about the weak  
axis and to achieve design economy.  
Anchor bolts\: Necessary to resist reactions at column bases.  
Foundations must be designed for reactions transmitted by the  
column bases and anchor bolts.  
Designers should verify that individual manufacturer’s standard  
practice and any special design considerations meet or exceed  
established engineering principles, local practice, and applicable  
building codes.

Metal building systems are predominantly used for single-story  
warehouse, agricultural, and light industrial facilities, though there  
is increasing demand for their use for office and retail facilities,  
and even expansion into the multistory market. This construction  
approach is particularly advantageous for applications requiring  
large interior clear spans, the support of heavy overhead cranes,  
or substantial expanses of roof. The metal building systems indus-  
try is able to respond to highly specialized needs, while still employ-  
ing standardized structural components and factory fabrication.  
Metal building systems take advantage of factory assembly tech-  
niques and quality control. The structural integration of frame  
components with the building skin, for strength and rigidity, per-  
mits economy in the size and number of steel framing components.  
Primary and secondary framing members, fasteners, and panels  
interact to produce a light, stable building envelope. Framing and  
cladding components are designed, engineered, and fabricated in  
a plant, then shipped to the project site for erection. Often, the  
same company designs, engineers, and builds the system.  
The metal building system integrates lightweight structural and  
envelope components, each of which add strength and rigidity to  
the overall form. The light weight of the envelope system, which is  
an asset for shipping, is, however, especially vulnerable to wind  
uplift, requiring care in design. Building corners and edges are  
particularly subject to wind-induced uplifting and suction.  
Additionally, the thin sheet steel wall panels may present acousti-  
cal issues when privacy or sound isolation are an issue.  
The standing seam metal roof system requires less maintenance  
than other alternatives, and its long-term performance record is  
excellent. Most standing seam metal roofs provide a free-floating  
monolithic membrane, connected by a series of slotted clips that  
allow movement. This method freely accommodates expansion/  
contraction cycles caused by thermal changes. In addition, a vari-  
ety of details, colors, and finishes are available. The standing seam  
metal roof may present several areas of concern to architects\: the  
modularity of roof panels and seams, important for locating plumb-  
ing stacks, skylights, and other roof equipment.  
Although the structural and envelope systems of metal buildings  
are usually highly integrated, metal building system manufacturers  
rarely consider the mechanical and interior components in any  
detail.

When using a metal building system a variety of exterior cladding  
alternatives are available, including lightweight corrugated metal,  
insulated sandwich panels that provide both interior and exterior  
finishes, masonry, and stucco. Metal building system manufactur-  
ers also offer door, window, and skylight components as integral  
parts of the envelope and interior. Designating responsibility for  
engineering, fabrication, and construction may allow better cost  
control. Architects working with metal building systems can rely on  
technical support from the manufacturer, including the preparation  
of fabrication and subsystem engineering documents.  
The typical rectilinear nature of metal building systems frequently  
results in buildings that are more easily expanded. Mechanical and  
interior components are integrated in the ceilings or in the struc-  
ture, but the mechanical equipment is normally kept on the exterior,  
sometimes presenting difficulty with visual integration.

# SPECIAL FUNCTION CONSTRUCTION  
Many manufactured products are available to limit noise and vibra-  
tion in buildings. Noise can transmit through the air and directly  
through building components or via vibration through the structure  
itself. The following discussion highlights a few common manufac-  
tured products that are available to address these concerns.  
The products described here are used for airborne sound insulation.  
Copyright © 2017. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved.  
Depending on the intended function, many spaces require a certain  
level of sound isolation from surrounding areas. Many common  
building components are available with specific acoustic ratings,  
but generally require specialized design and construction to  
achieve good performance. For example, where a high level of  
sound isolation is required between spaces that also need a visual  
connection, standard window assemblies may not be sufficient.  
Acoustic windows typically employ two panes of 1/4- to 1/2-in.-  
thick laminated glass separated by a 1- to 4-in. airspace and have  
been designed as an assembly to meet specific performance  
requirements up to Sound Transmission Class \(STC\) 55±. Where a partition is required to limit noise transmission, a door  
within that partition may be the weakest link, significantly down-  
grading the wall’s overall acoustic performance. To address this,  
acoustic seals that fit tightly against the door when it is closed can  
be applied at the frame head and jambs. Similarly, automatic drop  
seals at the door bottom that activate when the door is closed  
should be provided. Door bottom seals should be adjustable to allow  
a precision fit after installation. Seals help to reduce noise penetra-  
tion that occurs around the perimeter of the door, although sound  
isolation of a typical door, even with the addition of door seals, is  
generally limited to STC 35/40. Where increased acoustic perfor-  
mance is required, such as for recording studios or at machine  
rooms that abut occupied space, a unitary acoustic door and frame  
system should be utilized. These assemblies have been engineered  
to achieve acoustic ratings ranging from STC 45 to STC 60/65.  
Most acoustically rated doors will use two or more sets of acoustic  
seals at the head and jamb and cam lift hinges to ensure that the  
door fits tightly against the frame/seals when closed.  
Structure-borne noise is that noise that is transmitted as vibration  
through the building structure and is radiated off room surfaces.  
Impact noise, such as that from hard-heeled shoes on hard flooring  
surfaces, can be transmitted through the structural components.  
To mitigate this, resilient underlayment materials should be  
15.27 Wall panels are typically installed vertically, up to 40 ft. in length.  
Textured and smooth panels are typically factory finished, but may be  
field painted.

included as part of the floor assembly. Resilient underlayments are  
manufactured in a variety of thicknesses and materials, including  
meshed nylon wire, dense glass-fibers, rubber, and cork. An over-  
layment of lightweight concrete or plywood may be required to  
serve as a setting bed for the finished floor material.  
Another product to help reduce structure-borne noise through floor  
and wall assemblies is the resilient isolation clip or brace. These clips  
provide a resilient connection between the structure and the finished  
wall or ceiling surface to mitigate structure-borne noise. Figure  
15.32 shows standard furring channels held in place by the isolation  
clip, and a resilient receptor attached to the concrete floor slab.

# SITE EARTHWORK  
Slope protection and erosion control is required when steep slopes  
are subject to erosion from stormwater runoff or flowing streams.  
Erosion can damage the site and pollute waterways with sediment.  
The need for mechanical stabilization can be reduced through care-  
ful site gradings that divert or slow the velocity of runoff and by  
avoiding disturbances to stable, natural streambanks. Check with  
regulatory agencies before planning to grade streambanks, wet-  
lands, or floodplains.  
Numerous proprietary products are available for streambank sta-  
bilization and erosion control, so consult manufacturers.  
Follow these general design guidelines\:  
• Control erosion during construction with silt fences, straw  
bales, sediment ponds, and seeding and mulching. Adhere to  
local and state guidelines and regulations.  
• Line channels with erosion-resistant material \(sod, stone riprap,  
erosion-control blanket\). Channel dimensions and lining should  
be designed for expected runoff.  
• At the bottom of the slope drain channel, convey the flow to a  
storm sewer, detention pond, constructed wetland, or other  
control method that meets regulations.

# WATER MANAGEMENT  
The construction of buildings, tunnels, utilities, and roadways often  
requires excavations that extend below the groundwater level,  
potentially resulting in detrimental effects. Soils above the ground-  
water level provide confinement to hydrostatic pressures. Once  
these overburden soils are removed, upward fluid pressures act on  
the remaining soil particles, loosening them and causing a marked  
reduction in strength. In the case of granular soils \(including  
sands\), excavation below the groundwater can cause soils to act  
like a viscous fluid and lose virtually all strength. For finer-grained  
soils \(including materials containing silt and clay\), hydrostatic  
pressures can cause a significant increase in moisture content,  
with a corresponding decrease in strength.  
It is important to note that groundwater can cause adverse effects  
to overburden soils even when excavations do not extend below  
the static groundwater level. The use of vibratory equipment or  
heavy construction vehicles working in close proximity to the water  
table can cause water to migrate upward and cause a similar loss  
in strength.  
To prevent loss of density and strength to soils that will support  
structural elements, it is critical that groundwater be properly  
assessed during the geotechnical investigation and that appropri-  
ate measures be taken to control water during the construction  
phase. The need for construction or permanent dewatering, and  
the means of dealing with it, should be addressed in the soils  
report for the project.  
soil to a depth several feet below the groundwater level. The  
trenches are sloped such that the intercepted water drains to a  
low point, from which it is removed by gravity or pumped to a point  
off-site. Ditches are typically excavated along the upslope portion  
of the site or around the perimeter, to intercept water before it  
reaches the site. On larger sites, temporary ditches may also be  
required within the construction area. As this approach is typi-  
cally only applicable to sites containing slow-draining, finer-  
grained soils, ditching must often be performed well in advance of  
construction.  
Wellpoints may be utilized for site dewatering where granular  
materials such as sands and gravels are present and where exca-  
vations are to extend to only a moderate depth below grade.  
Wellpoints consist of a series of slotted pipes inserted vertically  
into the ground and connected in series to a horizontal header  
pipe. The header pipe, in turn, is connected to a vacuum pump. The  
system essentially creates negative pressure in the wells to  
extract water from the soil through suction. With a normal atmo-  
spheric pressure of about 14 psi and normal pressure losses in the  
system, the maximum depth to which this technique is effective is  
typically about 15 ft.  
of the groundwater level by 10 ft will cause an increase in stress of  
more than 600 psf to the materials below the new groundwater  
level. Such stress increases will result in some consolidation of the  
soils, which causes settlement of the ground surface both within the  
immediate project site and within a larger zone of influence extend-  
ing some distance beyond the excavation limits. This factor is of  
particular concern when an excavation is to be made immediately  
adjacent to developed properties.  
Dewatering can also change the direction of local groundwater  
flow. Should there be a contaminant plume in the vicinity of the site,  
it may be directed toward the dewatering system. Water collected  
under such conditions would need to be treated prior to discharge.  
Alternatives to dewatering may include\:  
• Installation of sheet piles, or slurry walls into a low permeabil-  
ity layer below the depth of the proposed excavation, to signifi-  
cantly reduce groundwater inflow without affecting the level of  
the groundwater beyond the excavation limits.  
• Freezing of the ground by employing injections of liquid nitrogen.  
This method causes the soil to act as an impermeable solid and  
allows the excavation to be made without removing water or  
affecting water beyond the zone of freezing.  
A number of methods can be used to control groundwater during  
the construction phase of a project. The selection of an appropriate  
method, or combination of methods, should be based on the nature  
of the subsurface materials through which the water flows and the  
depth to which the excavation must extend below the groundwater  
elevation. Acceptable means of water disposal should be deter-  
mined prior to implementation. Following are descriptions of some  
of the more common types of dewatering methods.  
Where groundwater must be lowered to a significant depth, or  
where subsurface materials contain significant quantities of silt  
and/or clay, wellpoints may not be adequate to lower the ground-  
water to the desired level. In such instances, deep wells are often  
used. A deep well consists of one or more boreholes drilled well  
below the groundwater level and the depth of the proposed cut,  
then fitted with a filtered pipe and a positive displacement pump.  
The pump, which is situated in the base of the well, is not depen-  
dent on suction to extract water from the surrounding soil. Water  
passes into the bottom of the well by gravity, and the pump dis-  
charges the collected fluid to the surface. Unlike wellpoints, deep  
wells can lower the water table 100 ft or more, depending on the  
depth and spacing of the wells and the capacity of the pump.  
In general, structures constructed or installed below the perma-  
nent groundwater table should be designed to be watertight, so  
that permanent dewatering is unnecessary. Where this is cost-  
prohibitive, and where a permanent lowering of the groundwater  
is desirable, several methods of permanent dewatering may be  
considered.  
As noted previously, deep wells consist of boreholes fitted with  
slotted pipe and a positive displacement pump. This type of system  
may be used as part of a permanent dewatering method, as well  
as for temporary construction applications. However, this type of  
method is not passive in nature, and requires periodic maintenance  
and upkeep, as well as a constant source of power, accessible  
cleanouts, and pressure-relief plugs.  
When excavations are to extend only a short distance below the  
groundwater level, and subsurface soils contain a significant  
quantity of silts and clays, often groundwater may be controlled by  
ditching. In this technique, narrow trenches are excavated into the  
When groundwater is pumped from the ground, the effective weight  
of the soil within the dewatered portion of the soil profile is  
increased roughly twofold. As a result, dewatering causes an  
increase in pressure on subsurface materials. For example, lowering

# ELEMENT G\: SITEWORK BASEMENT EXCAVATION  
# BASEMENT EXCAVATION  
Nearly all new structures require some excavation to construct  
foundations or basements. The removal of soil by excavation  
results in changes of the soil stresses below and around the exca-  
vation. Nature reacts to a vacuum, and gravity will cause the  
ground—and sometimes the groundwater surrounding the exca-  
vation—to move toward the excavated area. The deeper the  
excavation and steeper the excavation slope, the greater the  
unbalanced forces.  
Most soils have sufficient inherent strength to resist at least some  
of these unbalanced forces, at least for a short period of time. For  
shallow sloped excavations, the strength or resistance of most  
soils is sufficient to prevent excessive movements during the time  
required for construction. However, for deep excavations and/or  
areas that do not have sufficient room for a sloped cut, a tempo-  
rary excavation support system is required to prevent the earth  
from caving in on the excavation. The Occupational Safety and  
Health Administration \(OSHA\) stipulate numerous regulations  
controlling soil excavations. These regulations should be consulted  
prior to excavation work, particularly if personnel will be working  
within the excavated area.  
Most excavations that cannot be safely sloped back are supported  
with some type of temporary wall, called shoring, that can be con-  
structed from the ground surface. Types of temporary walls include  
interlocking steel sheet piles or steel soldier piles with wood lag-  
ging, secant walls, slurry walls, cofferdams, and trenching.  
Walls that extend to depths of 10 to 15 ft can generally be self-  
supported or cantilevered and do not require additional lateral  
support. This is accomplished by extending the shoring sufficient  
depth below the excavation. These “cantilevered” walls resist the  
lateral pressures from the soil and groundwater, although some  
deflection at the top of the wall should be expected. However, walls  
that extend deeper or have significant surcharge loads, or where  
deflection is a concern, will require some type of additional lateral  
support \(known as “braced walls”\).  
The most common types of shoring for earth support are interlock-  
ing steel sheet piling and timber shoring. Sheet piling is readily  
available in many shapes, sizes, and lengths, and is relatively  
watertight. Timber shoring uses less steel and is generally less  
expensive than sheet piling; however, it cannot be used as a bar-  
rier against groundwater flow, and could prove to be challenging  
where running sands are retained behind the walls.  
Sheet piling is installed from the surface with a pile hammer, which  
will generate noise and vibration. Timber shoring can also be  
installed with a pile hammer, or by drilling and setting the soldier  
piles, thereby significantly reducing the noise and vibration from  
the pile-driving operation.  
The lateral support can be internal to the excavation, in the form of  
wales, struts, or rakers. Internal bracing is very effective, but  
interferes with the construction of the permanent structure.  
External bracing of the excavation is usually in the form of drilled  
tieback \(ground\) anchors. The use of tieback anchors to support  
the wall enables a clear and unencumbered excavation, but  
requires access to areas beyond the building, which may extend  
outside the property line. For this reason, tieback anchors are  
almost always the most desirable method of lateral support if the  
owner controls the property around the excavation, or if tempo-  
rary easements can be obtained from private owners or public  
municipalities.  
Open-cut excavations are generally excavations of large areas with  
gradual sloping sidewalls that do not require shoring. This method can  
be acceptable when the following conditions have been considered\:  
• Sufficient room for the slope on either side of the excavation  
• Adequate room for placing the spoils away from the excavation  
• No surface or groundwater issues with the excavation  
• No loads near the top of the excavation, including\: vehicles,  
existing buildings, soil loads, or construction equipment  
Slope stability determines the slope of the sides of the excavation,  
which typically run at approximately 1.5 horizontal to 1.0 vertical  
for cohesionless soils under normal circumstances.

mold and a specific level of compactive energy to develop the  
moisture density curve for a specific soil. The maximum density  
from these curves defines the 100 percent level of compaction for  
a given soil. Compaction requirements for fill and backfill are gen-  
erally specified as a percentage of the maximum density, typically  
between 90 to 95 percent, as determined using one of the standard  
laboratory tests mentioned above. The low and high moisture con-  
tents are usually represented as a horizontal line connecting  
opposite sides of the Proctor curve for a given density. This repre-  
sents the range of moisture content within which the soil can be  
compacted most readily.  
Field density tests are performed on compacted soil to verify that  
a specific level of compaction has been achieved. There are sev-  
eral methods for determining the in-place density of soil. Today, the  
most commonly used method involves the nuclear density gauge, a  
device that measures the reflection of atomic particles from a tiny  
radioactive source material to determine the soil density and  
moisture content. The test is performed at the surface without any  
excavation, and results can be obtained faster than with other test  
methods.  
Moisture content of the fill and backfill should be near the optimum  
moisture content. Otherwise, the minimum required field density is  
very difficult \(or impossible\) to obtain, no matter how much energy  
is used for compaction. If the soil is too wet, the water in the pores  
cannot be expelled fast enough to allow for a sufficient decrease  
in volume. If the soil is too dry, the capillary forces around the soil  
particles are too large to be broken down by the compactive  
energy. Therefore, controlling the moisture of the fill and backfill to  
within specific limits near the optimum moisture content is neces-  
sary to achieve the required level of compaction.

Fill is typically used to raise or level site grades. Backfill is used to  
fill in spaces around below-grade structural elements, such as  
around basement walls. The fill must have sufficient strength or  
resistance and low compressibility to support its own weight and  
any other overlying structures \(pavements, floor slabs, founda-  
tions, etc.\) without excessive settlement. When soils are excavat-  
ed, they become loosened and disturbed. If they are suitable for  
reuse as structural fill or backfill, the soils must be placed in thin  
layers and compacted to achieve the required strength, resistance,  
and stability.  
type of soil, and moisture content. Soil is made up of solids and the  
void spaces between the solid particles. The void space almost  
always contains some water. If the water completely fills the void,  
the soil is considered to be totally saturated. During compaction,  
the total volume of the soil is decreased by reducing the volume of  
voids, while the volume of solids remains essentially unchanged. If  
the soil is saturated or nearly saturated during compaction, water  
must be expelled to decrease the void space.  
Compaction is the process by which mechanical energy is applied  
to a soil to increase its density. The degree to which soil can be  
densified depends on the amount and type of compactive effort,  
Nearly all soil exhibits a defined moisture-density relationship  
for a specific level of compactive effort.  
These relationships can be graphed in a nearly bell-shaped curve,  
with the maximum density at the apex, corresponding to the opti-  
mum moisture content .  
Standard laboratory tests, such as the Standard Proctor \(ASTM  
D-698\) and Modified Proctor \(ASTM D-1557\), use a standard-size  
To be most effective, the compaction equipment must match the  
type of soil to be compacted. In general, compaction equipment  
can be divided into two basic groups\: rollers or plates. Rollers  
come in large variations in size, but all use a weighted wheel or  
drum to impart energy to the soil. In addition, some rollers use an  
electric rotor to vibrate the drum, thereby increasing the energy to  
the soil. Other drums have protrusions called sheepsfoots, which  
impart a kneading action to the soils. Some plate compactors also  
use vibratory energy to compact the soils, while other plate com-  
pactors, called tampers , move up and down, imparting a vertical  
dynamic load to the soil.  
In general, coarse-grained granular soils such as sands and grav-  
els are more easily compacted than fine-grained soils such as clays  
and clayey silts. Vibratory energy is very effective in densifying  
sands and gravels, since the interparticle bonds are relatively  
weak. When the granular soils are vibrated at the correct fre-  
quency, the soil particles rearrange themselves into a denser state  
under their own weight and the weight of the compactor. Vibratory  
steel drum rollers and vibratory plate compacters are considered  
the most effective compaction equipment for granular soils.  
Fine-grained soils hold more moisture and have higher internal  
interparticle forces. Vibratory energy is much less effective for  
these soils. Clayey soils require more mechanical energy to break  
down the internal forces during compaction. The kneading action of  
a sheepsfoot roller is very effective in this regard.  
Fine-grained soils generally have a narrower range of moisture  
contents for optimum compaction. Often, the clayey soils are too  
wet to compact and the moisture content must be reduced.  
Reducing the moisture content in clay is typically done by allowing  
water to evaporate from the surface of the clay. The rate of evapo-  
ration is dependent on the ambient air temperature and wind condi-  
tions. However, the drying process can be enhanced by using a  
process called aeration in which steel discs are used to periodi-  
cally turn the soil, thus exposing more of the soil to the atmosphere.

# ELEMENT G\: SITEWORK SITE GRADING  
# SITE GRADING  
Through the process of grading and earthwork, the designer  
adapts a building program from a two-dimensional drawing board  
to the dynamics of an actual site. Through skillful grading, the  
designer directs drainage away from buildings and controls runoff  
from leaving the site and adversely affecting the environment. He  
or she creates level areas for intensive use, such as parking lots  
and playing fields. In addition to accommodating the functional  
requirements of the program, the designer may add to the experi-  
ence of visiting the site by screening out undesirable views and  
capitalizing on dramatic vistas. He or she may also manipulate the  
landforms to protect users from adverse elements such as wind  
and noise.  
Topographic changes in the landscape are represented on two-  
dimensional maps using the convention of contours. A contour is a  
horizontal plane slicing through the earth at a constant elevation  
above sea level or some other known reference elevation. A con-  
tour line, as illustrated on a topographic map, represents the edge  
of the contour plane as it meets the surface of the landform. The  
shoreline of a pond best represents the image of how a contour’s  
edge meets the surface. If the surface of the water represents the  
contour plane, and water seeks a constant elevation, then the  
water’s edge on a still pond could be illustrated as a contour line.  
If after a few dry days in summer the water elevation drops, then  
the surface represents a new contour elevation, and the still-moist  
shoreline retains evidence of the higher elevation.  
The contour interval, or the vertical distance between two con-  
tours, is always the same throughout an entire drawing. Intervals  
of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 are common. The smaller  
the interval, the greater the degree of accuracy on a map and the  
greater the number of contours represented. Selection of the  
interval is a function of the scale of the drawing, the steepness of  
the terrain, and the use intended for the property. A section drawn  
through several contours appears to represent a stacked configu-  
ration, but in reality, the change between contours represents a  
gradual transition, like the fluid landforms of the earth.

Gradient refers to the changing elevation along the Earth’s sur-  
face. The slope of a gradient, or the difference in elevation  
between two points over a given distance, is also defined as\:  
Slope = Rise/Run  
\(See Figure 16.10.\)  
Another frequently used helpful designation is\:  
Gradient = Vertical Distance/Horizontal Distance \(G=V/H\)  
Memorizing the following inversions of this equation is also useful\:  
V=G x H  
H=V/G  
Gradients may be expressed as percentages, decimals, ratios, or  
angles. Percent slope is based on the rise or fall over a distance of  
100 ft. The decimal equivalent for a 25 percent slope is 0.25. In a  
ratio, the horizontal dimension is traditionally given first, as in 4\:1  
\(four to one\). Ratios are often used when describing steeper  
slopes.  
In small-scale construction, such as when laying out a brick patio,  
contractors often refer to slopes in terms of inches per foot. A 2  
percent slope is equivalent to 1/4 in. per ft; a 1 percent slope is  
equivalent to 1/8 in. per ft. This allows for a greater degree of  
accuracy within subtle grade changes.  
Grades on consistently sloping surfaces are identified on grading  
plans with small arrows, pointing downhill. Maximum and minimum  
ratios are identified on gradients of gradual or ever-changing slopes.  
Spot elevations represent exact elevations at key points, usually  
accurate to the hundredths’ place. The highest and lowest elevations  
on a landform are usually designated with spot elevations.  
Rougher surfaces require greater slope for positive drainage than  
smooth surfaces because the friction encountered can slow the  
speed of water and potentially result in surface ponding. Ponding  
on walkways can create a slipping hazard for pedestrians on a wet  
surface, which can be exacerbated with winter icing.  
Surface texture can also affect the perception of slope. Coarser  
textures are less noticeable than smooth. As a general rule, slopes  
of 2 percent and above are clearly perceptible to the eye. Lesser  
slopes may be more visible if a contrasting horizontal line is adjacent.

# SITE IMPROVEMENTS  
Thoroughfares are endowed with two attributes\: capacity and  
character. Capacity refers to the number of vehicles that can move  
safely through a segment within a given time. It is physically  
manifested by the number of lanes and their width and by the  
centerline radius, the curb radius, and the super elevation of the  
pavement. Character refers to a thoroughfare’s suitability for  
pedestrian activities and a variety of building types. Character is  
physically manifested by the thoroughfare’s associated building,  
frontage, and landscape types and sidewalk width. Many communi-  
ties currently incorporate bicycle lanes into their urban planning as  
alternate means of transportation.  
Conventional traffic engineering practice uses terms such as “col-  
lector” and “arterial,” which denote only capacity. This is too sim-  
plistic and tends to create an environment inhospitable for  
pedestrians. The following nomenclature more adequately  
describes the combination of capacity and character necessary to  
create true urbanism.

Capacity and character are combined and adjusted to achieve a  
complete series of useful thoroughfare types. The series is best  
regarded in pairs\: keeping the right-of way width \(R.O.W\) constant,  
each pair illustrates one type suitable in two ways, one for a rela-  
tively rural condition and another suitable for a more urban condition.

In setting design parameters, the designer assumes that all vehi-  
cles present are “design vehicles.” Design vehicles are selected to  
represent approximately the 85th percentile vehicle in a range  
from smallest to largest. In the recent past, small or compact car  
stalls were often separated from large or standard stalls in parking  
designs. However, a decline in smaller car sales and the increasing  
use of light trucks, vans, and utility vehicles \(LTVUs\) for personal  
transportation have made small-car-only stalls ineffective as a  
design tool. Therefore, while small car and large car design vehi-  
cles—as well as a composite encompassing both small and  
large—have been given here for reference, parking design must  
be based on a composite passenger vehicle that includes not only  
cars but light trucks, vans, and sport/utility vehicles.

# PARKING LOTS  
Creating vital places is the job of those of who design, build,  
finance, and plan the built environment. Unfortunately, too often,  
as acres of asphalt attest, engineering standards are applied cava-  
lierly; they are not used properly to help design the place. Even  
“just a parking lot” can be made into a place of delight.  
Some strategies to employ that go beyond bare-bones engineering  
are\:  
• Parking courts \: Like the forecourt of a grand English manor, a  
parking place can serve as the introduction to a building. It may  
be a formal garden, an entrance hall, or a place to display art.  
• Multiple uses \: For many of the hours in a year, even a busy park-  
ing lot stands empty or underused. Find and design for other  
activities such as youth basketball, or the summer yard of a  
garden store.  
• Design for pedestrians \: Make the pedestrian activities the high-  
est priority in the placement, size, location, and other details of  
the site design. Virtually everyone who drives to a parking lot  
walks out of it.  
• Reduce parking \: Find a means for multiple uses to share a lot  
over the course of the day or week. Design so that people can  
park once and go to multiple destinations. Design so that the  
parking does not impede other modes of transport such as walk-  
ing, bicycles, or buses.  
The tables and diagrams in this section provide the basic guide-  
lines for the size and layout of stalls, grades in parking lots, the  
geometry of end islands, and the number of accessible stalls. For  
more detailed information on the design of access driveways, cir-  
culation patterns, calculating parking demand, safety, sustainabili-  
ty, and other aspects, refer to Parking Spaces\: A Design,  
Implementation, and Use Manual for Architects, Planners, and  
Engineers, by Mark C. Childs \(New York\: McGraw-Hill, 1999\).

16.29 a. Turnover categories\: A = very high turnover, such as at a post  
office or convenience store; B = high turnover, such as at a general  
retail store; C = medium turnover, such as at airports or hospitals;  
D = low turnover, such as at an employee parking lot.  
b. Figure 16.63 defines the dimensions used in this table.  
c. Stalls at angles between 90° and 60° are confusing as to whether the  
aisle is one-way or two-way. Do not use angles between 90° and 75°.  
Stalls at a 75° angle with two-way aisles are advocated by some  
because the right-hand side parking maneuver is easier into an angled  
stall; however, making a left-hand turn to park in a 75° stall is difficult.  
A minimum of 22 ft is necessary for two-way aisles, and 24 to 25 ft  
allows ample walking space and occasional left-hand parking. Stalls at  
angles between 45° and 0° \(parallel parking\) are not generally advis-  
able because they are space-inefficient and confusing.  
d. Stall stripes are often painted 6 to 10 in. shorter than the stall depth  
to encourage drivers to pull fully into the stall.  
e. The table uses a minimum aisle width of 11 ft. This dimension is  
minimally sufficient to allow passage of cars and pedestrians. In high  
turnover or special situations such as lots primarily serving the elderly  
or children, a pedestrian walkway and/or a wider aisle should be provided.

government agencies generally follow Title II rules, which are usu-

Design guidelines for the layout of parking stalls are as follows\:  
• Two accessible stalls may share an access aisle. However, this  
should be done only when the stalls are at 90° and allow both  
front-in and back-in parking.  
• Curb ramps or other obstructions may not be within the stall’s  
access aisle, but may begin at the curb face when vehicles  
overhang a curb \(Chrest, Smith & Bhuyan, 1996, p. 212\).  
• Car overhang may not obstruct the clear width of a sidewalk  
access route. Wheel stops and/or a reinforced signpost may  
help limit car overhang.

Whenever parking is supplied, no matter how the total amount is  
determined, a portion of the stalls must be accessible to people  
with mobility impairment \(hereafter called accessible stalls \). Local  
codes may exceed the federal requirement for required number of  
accessible stalls listed in Figure 16.33; the more stringent rule  
governs. When a facility has more than one parking lot, the  
required number of stalls is determined lot by lot. In employee or  
contract lots, accessible stalls must be provided, but “accessible  
spaces may be used by persons without disabilities when they are  
not needed by \(persons\) with disabilities” \(Bulletin \#6\: Parking,  
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board,  
1994\). When the use of a facility—for example, a senior center—  
indicates that more accessible stalls are needed than are required  
according to Figure 16.33, a study should be conducted to deter-  
mine an adequate supply of accessible stalls.  
Parking spaces that are to be accessible should be designated by  
signage indicating the spaces are reserved. Van-accessible spaces  
should have the words “van-accessible” printed below the univer-  
sal symbol of accessibility. The ADAAG requires that the sign not be  
obscured by a car or parked van. Centering the sign on the access  
aisle may improve its visibility.

Parking is a critical element of accessibility. In fact, the first fed-  
eral court case that resulted in a civil penalty under Title III of the  
Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) was for failure to make  
parking accessible.  
The ADA is a civil rights law, meaning that the Department of  
Justice is charged with enforcing the law. People who believe they  
have been discriminated against may sue the property owner. The  
ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities \(ADAAG\)  
The location of accessible stalls must give mobility-impaired per-  
sons preferential treatment in terms of access, and must not dis-  
criminate against them in terms of amenities \(e.g., if the general  
stalls have hail protection canopies, the accessible stalls must  
also\). The shorthand rule is that accessible stalls should be located  
with the shortest possible route to the entrance\(s\). Relevant U.S.  
regulations include the following\:  
“Accessible parking spaces serving a particular building shall  
be located on the shortest route of travel from adjacent park-  
ing to an accessible entrance. In parking facilities that do not  
serve a particular building, accessible parking shall be locat-  
ed on the shortest accessible route of travel to an accessible  
pedestrian entrance of the parking facility. In buildings with  
multiple accessible entrances with adjacent parking, acces-  
sible parking shall be dispersed and located closest to the  
accessible entrances...”  
“Accessible spaces can be provided in other lots or locations,  
or in the case of parking garages, on one level only when  
equal or greater access is provided in terms of proximity to  
an accessible entrance, cost and convenience. The minimum  
number of spaces must still be determined separately for  
each lot...”  
Equipment such as parking meters, automated teller machines, pay  
stations, and ticket dispensers must have accessible controls.  
Most such equipment is now designed with operating mechanisms  
that are considered accessible, so the designer’s major role is to  
place the controls at a proper level and to provide clear access to  
them.  
Specifically, parking meters for accessible stalls should be placed  
at or near the head or foot of the parking space, to ensure that no  
obstruction occurs for the operation of a side lift or a passenger-  
side transfer. The meter should be placed a maximum of 42 in.  
above the public sidewalk. The accessible stall should be a mini-  
mum of 30 in. by 48 in.  
There must be at least one passenger loading zone for the mobility  
impaired whenever designated loading zones are provided. There  
must also be an access aisle at least 5 ft wide and 20 ft long adja-  
cent and parallel to the vehicle pull-up space. A clear height of  
9 ft-6 in. is required at the loading zone and along the vehicle route,  
to, from, and within the zone. The vehicle space and the access  
aisle must be level with surface slopes not exceeding 1\:50 \(2 per-  
cent\) in all directions. Neither curb ramps nor street furniture may  
occupy the access aisle space.

# POROUS PAVEMENTS  
Porous pavements reduce or eliminate urban stormwater prob-  
lems at the source by changing the way urban structures are built  
and the way they operate hydrologically. They restore the land-  
scape’s natural water-retaining function by bringing water back  
into contact with the underlying soil, or emulate it by filtering and  
storing water in the pavement structure. By combining pavement  
stormwater control functions into a single structure, they reduce  
costs, compared with dense pavements that require downstream  
stormwater control facilities.  
Properly applied porous pavements can also enlarge urban tree  
rooting space, reduce the urban heat island effect, reduce traffic  
noise, increase driving safety, and improve appearance. Therefore,  
their selection and implementation are integral parts of the multi-  
faceted concerns of urban design, and all of their effects are con-  
sidered together in evaluations of benefits and costs. As porous  
paving materials become increasingly used, their potential cumula-  
tive effect is great, because pavements are the most ubiquitous  
man-made structures—they occupy two-thirds of the constructed  
surfaces in urban watersheds.  
This section briefly reviews the types of porous paving materials  
that are available and some provisions necessary in their installa-  
tion. Considerably more scope and detail on this subject are cov-  
ered in the book Porous Pavements , by Bruce K. Ferguson \(Boca  
Raton, FL\: CRC Press, 2005\).  
To make a successful porous pavement, it must be selected right,  
designed right, installed right, and maintained right. Failures—  
clogging and structural degradation—result from neglecting one or  
more of these steps. Construction of porous pavements is not more  
difficult than that of dense pavements, but it is different, and its  
different specifications and procedures must be strictly adhered to.  
The dominant component in most porous paving materials is aggre-  
gate, such as crushed stone. It is crucial that this aggregate be

“open-graded”—that is, have a narrow range of particle sizes. The  
void space between single-sized particles typically amounts to 30  
to 40 percent of the aggregate’s volume; the aggregate’s perme-  
ability is commonly over 1,000 in. per hour. As long as the particles  
are angular, open-graded aggregate obtains structural stability  
from particle-to-particle interlock.  
To protect a pavement’s surface from sedimentary clogging, sur-  
face drainage should be away from the pavement edge in every  
possible direction, so that sediment is prevented from washing on  
and, conversely, being allowed to wash off. On the downhill side,  
large, numerous curb cuts should be added, if necessary. On the  
uphill side, a swale should be added, if necessary, to divert poten-  
tially sediment-laden runoff. These provisions limit most porous  
pavements to infiltrating the stormwater that falls directly upon the  
pavement, not runoff from surrounding earthen slopes.  
Each porous paving material has its own advantages and disadvan-  
tages for specific applications, and its own requirements for  
design, construction, and maintenance. A development site should  
be analyzed in detail to distinguish pavement settings where differ-  
ent, optimally suited materials can be placed. In all pavements,  
areas can be distinguished with different needs for hydrology,  
appearance, subsurface tree rooting, and cost.

There are a number of alternative porous paving materials,  
among them\:  
• Porous aggregate is unbound gravel, crushed stone, crushed  
recycled brick, or decomposed granite. In most regions,  
unbound aggregate is both the least expensive of all firm surfac-  
ing materials and the most permeable. It is suitable for very  
light traffic such as that in residential driveways, lightly used  
portions of parking lots, and lightly used walkways. Annual  
maintenance for weeding or to replace lost material may be  
necessary.  
• Porous turf makes a “green” open space where transpiration  
actively cools urban heat islands. It is suitable for bearing very  
light traffic, such as that in parking spaces used once per week  
or during seasonal peak shopping periods. The rooting-zone  
soil should be sandy, to resist compaction. Porous turf must be  
regularly mowed, fertilized, and irrigated; and because mainte-  
nance must be scheduled, it should be used only where traffic  
can be controlled or predictably scheduled.  
• Plastic geocells are latticelike products that hold aggregate or  
topsoil in their cells, inhibiting displacement and compaction.  
The surface permeability, temperature, and visual appearance  
are essentially that of the grass or aggregate fill.  
• Open-jointed blocks and open-celled grids are units of concrete,  
brick, or stone, with open joints or cells. Porous aggregate or turf  
in the openings gives the pavement its porosity and permeability.  
Many block products can bear remarkably heavy traffic, but  
absorb water intended for turf and hold heat in warm climates.  
• Porous concrete is portland cement concrete made with single-  
sized aggregate. A qualified installer is required. The durability  
of porous concrete in cold climates can be enhanced by air  
entrainment and polymer fiber reinforcing. Properly installed  
porous concrete can bear heavy traffic loads, and the surface is  
universally accessible by most measures.  
• Porous asphalt is bituminous concrete made with single-sized  
aggregate. Polymer fibers and liquid polymer additive can  
reduce drainage of the binder down through the pores—without  
them, the binder would leave surface aggregate particles  
unbound while accumulating into a clogging layer inside the  
structure. Properly installed porous asphalt can bear heavy traf-  
fic loads, and the surface is universally accessible by most  
measures.  
• “Soft” paving materials include granular organic or recycled  
materials such as bark mulch, crushed shells, and rubber gran-  
ules. They are suitable for very light traffic such as that in pedes-  
trian walkways, residential driveways, equestrian ways, and very  
lightly used parking stalls. Materials with durable single-sized  
particles have the highest infiltration rates and are the least  
susceptible to displacement, crushing, and compaction.  
• Decks are surrogates for pavements. They are completely per-  
meable to air and water as long as their decking components  
are perforated or spaced apart from each other. Their footings  
leave the soil below almost entirely free for infiltration and tree  
rooting. Decks are uniquely suited to sites with steep slopes or  
where native tree roots or ecosystem dynamics are to be very  
conscientiously protected. They are made from a variety of natu-  
ral, manufactured, and recycled materials; hence, their durabil-  
ity varies with the material and its preservative treatment.

# ELEMENT G\: SITEWORK POROUS PAVEMENTS  
Unit paving assemblies are used principally for applications such  
as shopping plazas, building entrances, walkways, patios, residen-  
tial driveways, and residential parking areas. But they may also be  
used for streets with heavy vehicular traffic and for industrial  
floors or other special conditions.  
There are several types of unit pavers\:  
• Precast concrete unit pavers  
• Brick unit pavers  
• Wood pavers  
• Recycled-rubber pavers  
• Stone pavers  
• Porous unit pavers  
APPLICATIONS  
• Application PS refers to heavy paving brick for general, all-  
purpose use. Where there is a greater concern for overall uni-  
formity, including precision in dimension, degree of warping,  
and chipping, Application PX should be specified.  
• Application PA deals with paving bricks with specific visual  
characteristics, such as size and color.  
• Consult with a landscape architect or engineer for appropriate  
design guidelines.

Because of its more vulnerable exposure to weathering, and the  
constant stress of traffic, even light-traffic brick pavers must  
maintain higher compressive strength and lower porosity than face  
brick. ASTM C 902, “Standard Specification for Pedestrian and  
Light Traffic Paving Brick,” establishes the criteria for pedestrian  
and light-traffic brick pavers. Light-traffic refers to frequency, or  
pavements that receive limited vehicular traffic at low speeds,  
such as driveways and arrival courts \(light does not refer to the  
weight of a vehicle\). An arrival court may normally receive automo-  
bile traffic, but the occasional moving van will not damage an  
ASTM C 902 paver. The classification of light-traffic brick pavers is  
dependent on its intended application and use. There are three  
weathering classes of pavers and three types of pavers, based on  
anticipated traffic and the required levels of resistance to abrasion  
by traffic.  
CLASSES  
• Class SX \(severe exposure\) should be specified where pave-  
ments may encounter freezing while saturated with water. In  
contrast to face brick, Class SX pavers must have a minimum  
average compressive strength of 8,000 psi. An individual unit  
may not have strength below 7,000 psi.  
• Class MX \(moderate exposure\) may be called for in southern  
climates where freezing is not expected.  
• Class NX \(negligible exposure\) is for interior use only.  
TYPES  
• Type I bricks are recommended where highly abrasive traffic is  
anticipated, such as in driveways or heavily concentrated pedes-  
trian zones.  
• Type II bricks are best suited for typical pedestrian environ-  
ments such as public walkways.  
• Type III bricks offer the least resistance to abrasion and should  
be used in low-traffic residential applications.  
Paver units are selected according to color, texture, abrasion  
resistance, and resistance to weathering. The texture of the unit  
affects slip resistance \(the coarser the texture, the better the slip  
resistance\). Abrasion resistance refers to the wear and tear an  
assembly is subjected to under normal use. According to ASTM C  
902 \(brick pavers\) and ASTM C 936 \(concrete pavers\), an abrasion  
index classification determines the type of unit required for an  
intended exposure. A dense, hard-burned extruded brick with 8,000  
psi compressive strength that conforms to ASTM C 902, Class SX,  
Type I \(water absorption of less than 5 percent, meets/exceeds C  
67 freeze/thaw\) resists both abrasion and weathering and is ade-  
quate for most heavy-traffic exterior applications. Molded brick  
with 4,000 psi compressive strength conforms to ASTM C 902,  
Class SX, Type II, and may be adequate for most exterior pedes-  
trian applications only. Some manufacturers recommend 8,000 psi  
pavers for both vehicular and pedestrian applications. Consult the  
manufacturer to learn which products are suitable for use as pav-  
ers in a particular application.  
For all light or heavy vehicular traffic applications, 3-1/8-in.  
paver thickness is recommended; 2-3/8-in. thickness is recom-  
mended for pedestrian applications. Assess potential traffic  
loads when planning unit paving installations. Heavy vehicular  
loads require a rigid or semirigid continuous base, whereas a  
flexible base and flexible paving are suitable for light vehicular  
loads \(residential type\). Use either base type for pedestrian traf-  
fic. Appropriate base courses for heavy traffic would include  
asphalt over roadbase \(Class 6\), concrete over Class 6 roadbase,  
and just Class 6 roadbase. When using only roadbase under  
heavy loads, it should be at least twice as thick as the recom-  
mended 6-in. roadbase for pedestrian traffic. \(Roadbase refers to  
compacted aggregate stone base course and the Classes are  
referencing DOT \(Division of Transportation\) standards\).

Where vehicular traffic is greater in speed, volume, and weight, a  
stronger brick is naturally required. Brick in heavy-traffic situa-  
tions not only must tolerate the added structural load, but is also  
subjected to greater abrasion and the tendency for both horizontal  
and twisting forces. ASTM C1272, “Standard Specification for  
Heavy Vehicular Paving Brick,” establishes the standard. ASTM  
lists two types and three application classifications for heavy  
vehicular paving brick.  
TYPES  
• Type R is intended for situations where a rigid or semirigid set-  
ting bed and base are provided \(such as concrete or asphalt\).  
With Type R pavers, the minimum average compressive strength  
is set at 8,000 psi, with the rigid setting bed and base contribut-  
ing to the overall compressive strength of the cross section.  
Type R pavers carry a minimum thickness dimension of 2-1/4 in.  
• Type F brick is stronger and better suited for use with a flexible  
base \(such as compacted aggregate\), along with an adequately  
compacted subgrade. Type F pavers are required to have a  
higher overall compressive strength than Type R pavers, with a  
minimum average of 10,000 psi. Type F pavers must have a thick-  
ness of no less than 2-5/8 in.  
16.38 a. The height of pavers varies with the manufacturer and appli-  
cation, but is usually 1-1/4, 2-1/4, 2-5/8, or 2-3/4 in.  
b. Check with manufacturers for availability of chamfers.  
16.39 a. For curved conditions, use a manufactured angle-edge  
restraint with same-size expansion bolts at preset openings. No anchor  
may be greater than 6 in. from the gap or end of run. Spacing of gaps  
may increase depending on design of restraint. Recommended spacing  
of gaps should not exceed 5 ft o.c.  
b. If the landscape edging is aluminum, paint the area that comes in  
contact with the concrete slab with bituminous paint. Also, provide an  
insulating fiber washer.  
c. Meet flush with adjacent hardscape finish grades.  
d. Refer to drainage detail if unit pavers slope to restraint.

Choose a bond pattern based on expected traffic patterns—traffic  
should travel perpendicular to the long dimension of the paving  
unit. For vehicular areas, use a gravel subbase \(minimum 6 in. of  
crushed gravel\) compacted to 95 percent, and paver sizes 8 in.  
square or smaller. Consult a civil engineer to accurately define  
paver sizes, shapes, gravel depth, concrete base depth, and con-  
crete reinforcement requirements.  
Proper subgrade preparation of areas to be paved is important.  
Here are relevant guidelines\:  
• Remove all vegetation and organic material, and consider the  
location of existing or proposed underground utilities and storm  
drainage, as well as user convenience.  
• Plan for surface and subsurface drainage. Slope paving away  
from buildings, retaining walls, and so on, at 1/8 to 1/4 in. per  
foot. Rigid paving always requires adequate surface drainage,  
with the long dimension of the mortar joints running parallel to  
the direction of runoff. Flexible paving requires both surface and  
subsurface drainage.  
• Prevent horizontal movement of all types of mortarless unit  
paver assemblies—this is imperative. If the pavers are on an  
aggregate base, provide a rigid plastic edge restraint using  
spikes driven into the stone base designed for this purpose. A  
flush concrete curb works as well. If the paving system is over  
a concrete base, regardless of the setting bed \(sand or bitumi-  
nous\), the pavers along the edge can be mortared to the base,  
but take care to ensure this method does not trap water which  
will seep into the setting bed. Another method is to secure an  
angle iron to the concrete base with anchor bolts, allowing for  
gaps on a regular basis to permit seepage. Cover vertical gaps  
with a small, perforated metal sheet for bituminous setting  
beds, or filter fabric for sand beds, to prevent erosion.  
In addition, be aware that chamfers on both clay and concrete  
pavers are required for heavy driving applications \(e.g., public  
streets and parking lots\). Chamfered edges avoid the splintering of  
edges that can occur.  
There are three major types of unit paver joint material\:  
• Mortar  
• Grout \(portland cement and sand without hydrated lime\)  
• Dry mixture of grout  
# PEDESTRIAN PAVING  
Additional design guidelines for working with unit paving systems  
include the following\:  
• Drainpipes may be omitted at well-drained areas.  
• Provide positive outflow for drainpipes.  
• Do not use unsatisfactory soil \(expanding organic\). Satisfactory  
soil must be compacted to 95 percent.  
• Hand-tight paving joints are preferred over mortar joints.  
However, when mortar joints are required, and freezing and  
thawing are frequent, use latex-modified mortar.  
• Install concrete footing for edging 10 to 14 in. wide and 6 to  
8 in. deep. It is preferable to place the bottom of the footing at  
freezing depth. If the freezing depth is deeper than the bottom  
of the footing, provide 4 in. of gravel below the footing.  
• Interlocking pavers are available in concrete, hydraulically  
pressed concrete, asphalt, and brick in different weight classifi-  
cations, compressive strengths, surface textures, finishes, and  
colors. Consult local suppliers for availability.  
• Subject to the manufacturer’s recommendations and local code  
requirements, use interlocking concrete pavers in areas subject  
to heavy vehicle loads at speeds of 30 to 40 mph.  
• Be aware that concrete interlocking unit paver sizes may be  
based on metric dimensions. When paver shape permits, use the  
herringbone pattern for paving that is subject to vehicular traffic.  
• Continuous curb or other edge restraint is required to anchor  
pavers in applications subject to vehicular traffic.

When working with unit pavers, keep in mind the following facts  
and guidelines\:  
• Unit paving assemblies are also classified according to the type  
of base supporting the paver, either rigid, semirigid continuous  
or flexible. Base types are a reinforced or unreinforced con-  
crete slab-on-grade that accepts either rigid or flexible pavers  
\(rigid \); asphalt or bituminous concrete that accepts flexible  
pavers only \(semirigid continuous \); a compacted gravel, sand,  
or sand-cement mixture that accepts flexible pavers only \(flexi-  
ble \); and suspended diaphragm or structural floor and roof  
assemblies, which vary by design and accept either rigid or  
flexible pavers.  
• Setting bed \(cushion\) material, placed between the base and  
paving surface, functions as a leveling layer to help refine the  
finished grade and compensate for irregularities in the base  
and paver unit surfaces. Setting bed material should be a 1- to  
1-1/2-in. layer of bedding sand \(ASTM C 33\). Pavement can be  
subject to sinking when sand bedding layer is thicker than this.  
Cement or lime products are not recommended for jointing  
material. A flexible pavement \(no mortar\) with ASTM C 144 sand  
for jointing is preferable, regardless of use; however, there are  
products on the market that can be added to the joint sand to  
stabilize it. It is a particularly good idea to use such products  
with irregular sand molded brick pavers where there is a  
greater opportunity for wider joints, which may wash out. Doing  
so also reduces the chance of unwanted vegetation growing in  
the joints in less-traveled areas.

• Membranes are installed in unit paving assemblies for several  
purposes\: to control the passage of moisture, reduce weed  
growth, prevent the sand course from filtering into lower  
courses, and as a bond break. Consider using bond breaks  
between rigid paving and rigid bases to accommodate differen-  
tial movement. Membranes are of sheet or liquid material that  
can resist moisture, rot, and decay. Sheet materials include  
asphalt roofing felt, polyethylene film, vinyl, neoprene, and rub-  
ber. Liquid types are asphalt, modified urethane, or polyurethane  
bitumen; these are preferred for irregular surfaces.  
• Use base materials, including gravel, concrete, and asphalt, for  
support, drainage, and/or groundswell protection. For maximum  
drainage efficiency and to prevent upward capillary action,  
specify clean, washed gravel.  
• Expansion joints can alleviate thermal and moisture movement,  
especially in rigid or mortared assemblies. Expansion joints are  
generally located parallel or adjacent to curbs and edgings, at  
right angle turns, around interruptions \(e.g., manhole cover  
assemblies\), at set distances in long runs of masonry, and where  
dissimilar materials meet.  
• Expansion joints are required to be full depth up to finish grade  
for unit pavers mortared to a concrete slab. Full-depth expansion  
joints are optional when the setting bed is sand or bituminous  
over a concrete slab. However, in regions where the seasonal  
fluctuation in temperature is 50° or greater, during the cold  
season, pavers flanking an expansion joint below may show  
slight separation, which closes up in the warm season. This is  
only evident with the bituminous setting bed because each paver  
is adhered to the setting bed with a neoprene tack coat. A gap  
does not usually show up with a sand setting bed because the  
pavers have the flexibility to move.

# ELEMENT G\: SITEWORK EXTERIOR STAIRS AND RAMPS  
# EXTERIOR STAIRS AND RAMPS  
Throughout the centuries, stairs and ramps have been used to  
address elevation changes in the landscape. They can be heroic or  
modest, nuanced or straightforward, detailed or plain. They repre-  
sent for designers opportunities to create delight, variety, view-  
points, and accents in the movement of people across a landscape.  
They are also zones for heightened access and safety consider-  
ation. This section leaves for the designer’s imagination the full  
potential of stairs and ramps as artistic design elements, and  
concentrates instead on access and safety design issues.  
Stairs and ramps as components of the pedestrian walkway sys-  
tem are regulated for minimum design standards at federal, state,  
and local levels. With the Americans for Disabilities Act \(ADA\), the  
role of stairs and ramps in creating accessibility for all became a  
specific design focus. For designers, the first requirement is to  
thoroughly review the relevant jurisdiction’s accessibility and  
safety codes related to stairs and ramps. Any discrepancies  
between the information presented in this discussion and any  
regulation should always be resolved in the favor of the regulation.  
There are differences in the design requirements between local,  
state, and federal accessibility and safety regulations. Identifying  
and determining the relevant regulations for a project requires  
research and discussion with the project client. Private and local  
government projects usually must adhere to local, state, and fed-  
eral requirements. State and federal projects usually exempt  
themselves from application of regulations enacted by lower  
jurisdictional levels.  
A review meeting early in the design process with the relevant  
building code enforcement group is advisable. Determining the  
applicable regulations with the client is a professional liability  
responsibility of the design professional.

Single steps should be avoided, as they create a tripping hazard  
because of their lack of visibility. Stairs and steps in general should  
be distinguished from surround paving by a difference in material,  
color, or pattern, to highlight and make them more prominent. In  
most jurisdictions, when there are more than three steps, hand-  
rails must be provided.  
As a general rule, exterior stair landings should, at a minimum,  
match the width of the stairs and be a minimum of 3 ft deep.  
Exterior stairs when located at main entries or emergency exits of  
buildings should, at a minimum, be the width of the exiting door-  
ways. This helps to maintain a safe emergency egress zone.  
Providing a landing at doorways and gates that are served by stairs  
makes using doorways safer and more convenient. The swing of  
the door should be accounted for in scaling the depth of a landing,  
to avoid having to be on a step to open or close a door or gate.  
Installing intermediate stair landings where an elevation change of  
between 2-1/2 and 5 ft has been reached on a run of stairs creates  
a comfortable resting place for users. When longer runs of stairs  
are used, consideration for larger landings with opportunities for  
sitting should be given. Landings should be built with a minimum 2  
percent slope toward the downhill edge.

tripped, such as a toe under a step overhang or a heel at a sharp  
nose edge.  
The leading 2 inches of the tread shall have visual contrast of dark-  
on-light or light-on-dark from the remainder of the tread \(per ANSI  
A117.1\).  
Accessible ramp slope standards initially were based on research  
using disabled adult males as the test population. This means that,  
perhaps, it is not the best standard for the elderly, children, or the  
frail. Thus, for the greatest universal access of a project, designers  
should target for the lowest ramp slope rate practical. Research  
based on the elderly and children is beginning to show that a bet-  
ter slope rate for those populations is 1\:16 or lower. The 1\:12 or  
8.333 percent slope rate should be considered the maximum rate,  
not the goal.  
As a practical cost consideration, any ramp that is flatter than 1\:20  
does not require handrails and, thus, can avoid that cost.  
Exterior stairs and ramps must deal with climatic issues that inte-  
rior situations do not—obvious examples being rain and snow. In  
addition, the design and spatial variety of exterior landscape  
spaces make the location of stairs and ramps less predictable for  
pedestrians. Thus, in exterior design factors such as tread depth  
and slope, traction, and detectable warning zones become impor-  
tant issues to consider. Directly applying interior stair and ramp  
standards to exterior locations is generally not a good practice.  
A construction concern for concrete stairs is the placement of  
reinforcing bars. Reinforcing steel should be placed a minimum of  
3 in. back from any exposed surface of the step. Maintaining a  
minimum 3-in. clearance reduces the potential for breakup of the  
step due to differential freeze/thaw expansion between the rein-  
forcing steel and the concrete. This is especially important in the  
stair nose zone. Adding slip dowels and keyed joints at the top of  
concrete stairs to adjacent concrete paving or subsurface layers is  
a good construction detail, to avoid differential settlement and  
tripping hazards. The bottom step footing on concrete stairs or  
concrete subsurface for stairs should extend down, at a minimum,  
to the local freeze depth.  
There are two common locations for exterior ramps\: at street  
corners and crossings, and where grade changes occur. The design  
of street ramps is highly regulated by local, state, and federal  
ordinances. This discussion does not provide street ramp stan-

A rule of thumb for tread depths and riser heights for exterior  
stairs can be translated to this equation\:  
Height of two risers + depth of one tread = 26 inches  
For exterior locations, a recommended range for risers is between  
4 and 7 in., with recommended tread depth of 12 to 18 in.  
Stairs in exterior locations require a slope on the tread to shed rain  
and snow melt. A generally recommended slope is a 2 percent slope  
from front to back of tread, or a 1/4-in. on a 12-in.-wide tread.  
The leading edge of a step is called the step nose . Stair nose  
details vary depending on the material used. Detailing of the stair  
nose is an important safety consideration. The current accessibility  
standard is that step noses should have a radius of 1/2 in., with no  
overhang deeper than 1/2 in. on the step. The goal is to reduce the  
potential points where a person’s shoe could become trapped or

dards because the design requirements are diverse and undergo  
frequent review and modification. Thus, for street ramp standards,  
the design professional is referred directly to the relevant ordi-  
nance determined by discussion with the relevant code enforce-  
ment agency and the client.  
The most important design feature of an exterior ramp is the sur-  
face of the ramp. Ensuring that it is not slick in wet weather is  
critical for safety. Follow these guidelines\:  
• On concrete ramps, the surface should be, at minimum, a  
medium broom finish, with the broom strokes being perpendicu-  
lar to the flow of traffic.  
• Stone clad ramp designs should consider honed or scored sur-  
faces, and avoid any smooth, flat finish.  
• Metal ramp designs should consider structural grille/grate  
panels or embossed or patterned metal, and avoid any smooth  
finish.  
• Installing slip dowels or keyed joints at the tops and bottoms of  
ramps to adjacent paving helps to avoid differential movement  
that causes tripping hazards at the entries to the ramp.  
As part of the accessible system, stair and ramp handrails are  
covered under access and safety regulations. Their placement,  
height, length, strength, and safety details fall under the design  
guidance of these regulations. Thus, familiarity with the relevant  
codes is paramount.  
General requirements for all handrails are\:  
• The top of the handrail to stair nose or ramp surface distance  
should be constant—a height between 34 to 38 in.  
• The diameter or width of the handrail must be 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 in.  
• Structurally, the handrail must be able to withstand 250 lbs of  
downward pressure per inch.  
• The ends of handrails should not be sharp.  
• General standards for stair handrails are\:  
• At the top of the stair run, the rail must be level for 12 in.  
before the first step nose.  
• At the bottom of stair run, the rail must extend for one tread  
length at the same slope as over the majority of the stairs,  
then remain level for an additional 12 in.  
• General standards for ramp handrails are\:  
• At the top of the ramp, the rail must be level for 12 in. before  
the top of the ramp.  
• At the bottom of the ramp, the rail must remain level for 12  
in. beyond the end of the ramp.  
Design guidelines for ramp widths and landings are as follows\:  
• An accessible ramp should have a clearance between ramp  
handrails of at least 36 in., to allow a person in a wheelchair  
room for his or her hands to turn the wheels.  
• A ramp landing should occur at a maximum of 30 ft of run of a  
ramp. The ramp landing must be a minimum of 60 in. clear depth.  
• If ramps change direction at landings, the minimum landing size  
must be 60 by 60 in.  
• If an exterior doorway is located at a ramp landing, the landing  
must comply with safety and access requirements for the door.

Materials used in fountain and pool design should be durable—  
that is, capable of resisting damage caused by water, cracks,  
weather, stains, and freeze/thaw cycles. Suitable materials include  
stone, concrete, brick, tile, and metals such as copper, bronze, cast  
iron, and steel. Fiberglass, acrylic, and waterproof membranes  
such as PVC, EPDM, and butyl are commonly used.  
professional, as the complexities of water features require the  
efforts of many disciplines. The architectural support team should be  
composed of not only fountain consultants but plumbing, electrical,  
and structural engineers. In some situations, it is necessary to enlist  
chemical engineers, waterproofing consultants, and specifiers.  
Generally speaking, the design/build concept of fountains may not  
be in the best interest of architects or owners, due to the involved  
nature of competent systems.  
The metamorphosis of fountains has been geometric in the last  
20 years. Technology and innovation have teamed to allow design  
professionals greater flexibility in creating stunning displays.  
Education is likely the most important responsibility of the design  
Play is vital to the physical, emotional, and social growth of chil-  
dren. To encourage healthy growth, the play environment must  
challenge children at their level of development, yet reassure them  
as they investigate their physical limits. Each stage of development  
prompts different types and levels of interaction and activity. The  
outdoor play environment becomes increasingly important as the  
boundaries of the child’s world stretch beyond the home and pri-  
mary care. Play equipment should be selected and designed to  
attract, fascinate, and sustain the interest of the age groups who  
will use it, while promoting agility, strength, and balance.  
Playing may consist of imitation, role-play, and fantasy play, as well  
as more active pursuits. Space and equipment must be provided to  
encourage jumping, climbing, swinging, sliding, crawling, hanging,  
running, building, sitting, and meeting. Designs should provide  
opportunities for children to be imaginative and to interact socially.  
Ideally, the equipment should be a flexible, three-dimensional sys-  
tem that allows children to move in every direction and challenges  
them with a consistently changing space.

# ELEMENT G\: SITEWORK SITE DEVELOPMENT  
ADA Accessibility Guidelines \(ADAAG\) for Play Areas, which may be  
found at www.ada.gov .  
Three age groups must be considered in designing playgrounds.  
Toddlers \(3 to 5 years\) should be separated from older children by  
a fence they can see through. This makes it easier for caregivers  
to supervise the younger children yet allows the toddlers to feel a  
part of things. Early elementary \(6 to 9 years\) and late elementary  
\(9 to 12 years\) children have traditionally been separated, but an  
option is to design equipment that has several levels of difficulty,  
allowing use by both groups.  
Most traditional play equipment is designed to stand alone as sin-  
gle units, although these may be linked together. Where space or  
other conditions limit the scope of development, such equipment is  
useful. However, because a child’s play activity tends to proceed in  
a continuous flow, integrated play areas have proved more suc-  
cessful than arrangements of individual items. Combining several  
materials, colors, and textures also makes the play space more  
inviting. A variety of options are available to the designer in both  
custom and manufactured products.  
It is important to note that playgrounds are required to be acces-  
sible. For more information on these requirements, refer to the  
The design of a playground should meet the needs and sustain  
the interest of the children who will use the site. For example\:  
• Using nonrepetitive elements and semitransparent features  
creates mystery and surprise.  
• Dynamic, movable components allow more creative opportunities  
for children, and a variety of textures stimulates the sense of touch.  
• Children never tire of playing with sand and water. Manufacturers  
offer a wide variety of water features for the playground, includ-  
ing wading pools and fountains. Water elements also encourage  
adult interaction.  
• Space for congregating can be provided as semienclosed refuge  
or open area.  
• Bridges add interest to equipment and can provide connections  
between structures; they also create more climbing and refuge  
space. In addition to traditional plank bridges, there are arched,  
rope, suspension, or tire bridges.  
If a theme such as a ship, castle, or fort is incorporated in the  
playground, the playground equipment will automatically encour-  
age the child’s imagination. However, don’t replicate these themes  
too closely; leave most of the creation to the child.  
Adults should not be separated from the play area. Ample seating  
should be provided for them, and the playground equipment should  
be interesting to adults, too, as their presence enables security,  
instruction, and approval.  
Practical questions to answer when designing a playground are\:  
• How does the equipment appear from the surrounding area?  
• What are the views from the site?  
• How much noise will travel to and from the playground?  
The design should consider the time of day the equipment will be  
used and be suitable for use all year.  
As with any site development, good drainage is critical. If loose fill  
materials are used as protective surfacing, drainage must not be  
allowed to pass through the loose fill material, otherwise compac-  
tion and or erosion of the protective surfacing can occur. Shade is  
desirable in hot climates, especially for playgrounds designed for  
2- to 5-year-olds. Metal slides should not be used unless the slide  
is shaded.

No playground is completely safe. The potential for accidents is  
inherent in the element of risk involved in most play. Nonetheless,  
playground equipment should provide challenging activities in the  
safest way possible.  
Round, square, and rectangular timber should be pine or fir \(oak  
warps; redwood splinters\). Color should be in the form of stain, not  
paint, and all edges should be beveled or rounded. Steel pipe,  
sheets, chain, and drums can be vinyl-coated. Chain, rope, and tires  
are available in plastic. Use of concrete and stone should be kept  
to a minimum. Hardware should be galvanized or stainless steel,  
and joints and connections covered or recessed.  
For guidance, designers should consult the U.S. Consumer Product  
Safety Commission’s Handbook for Public Playground Safety, and  
ASTM International’s ASTM F 1487.01, “Standard Consumer Safety  
Performance Specification for Playground Equipment for Public  
Use.” Playground designs should adhere to the guidelines estab-  
lished in both publications. In addition, the National Recreation and  
Park Association certifies playground auditors. Prior to use by the  
public, playgrounds should be audited for safety by a certified  
playground auditor.  
Stagger vertical joints from course to course 6 in. minimum hori-  
zontally. The thickness of the wall at any point should not be less  
than half the distance from that point to the top of the wall.  
Retaining walls are designed and constructed to resist the thrust  
of the soil, which can cause the wall to fail by overturning, sliding,  
or settling. In stone walls, resistance to soil thrust can be helped  
by battering the stonework \(i.e., recessing or sloping the masonry  
back in successive courses\).  
Garden-type retaining walls, usually no higher than 4 ft, are gener-  
ally made from small building units of stone, masonry, or wood. For  
higher walls, reinforced concrete is more commonly used. Terracing  
may be built with walls of wood, stone, brick, or concrete.  
Walls less than 2 ft high do not require drains or weepholes.  
Preservative-treated wood is recommended for any design in  
which wood comes in contact with the ground. Redwood may be  
substituted if desired.

When designing cast-in-place concrete retaining walls, keep these  
guidelines in mind\:  
• Provide control and/or construction joints in concrete retaining  
walls approximately every 25 ft. Every fourth control and/or  
construction joint should be an expansion joint. Coated dowels  
should be used if average wall height on either side of a joint is  
different.  
• Consult with a structural engineer for final design of all concrete  
retaining walls.

# LANDSCAPING  
As a rule of thumb, a tree’s rooting zone must be at least 24 in.  
deep and at least as large in area as the tree’s canopy at maturity.  
In densely built-up urban areas, porous pavements with base  
courses of “structural soil” make long-lived trees viable. The  
porous surface course admits air and water. The rooting zone is the  
pavement’s base course, made of single-sized aggregate that  
bears the pavement’s load. Into the aggregate’s void space is  
mixed no more than 15 to 20 percent, by volume, of nutrient- and  
water-holding soil; the remaining unfilled void space provides  
aeration, drainage, and rooting space. A hydrogel can be used to  
hold the soil onto the aggregate particles during mixing. Aggregate  
made of expanded shale, clay, or slate \(ESCS\) provides additional  
water-holding capacity; some ESCS aggregates also provide nutri-  
ent-holding capacity. Drainage at the base of the rooting layer is  
mandatory.  
predominant wind direction, annual rainfall, and temperature  
variations. When irrigation systems are subject to freezing tem-  
peratures, precaution against damage to the system components  
from freezing must be built into the design.  
Planting materials have different requirements for water. In fact,  
variations of turf grass may have vastly different watering needs.  
Plant water requirements include water lost by evaporation into  
the atmosphere from the soil and soil surface, and by transpiration,  
which is the water actually used by the plan. The combination of  
these is called evapotranspiration \(E.T.\).  
Because turf grass has the highest rate of E.T. of any planting  
materials in the landscape, and because the E.T. of turf varies  
depending on the seasons, irrigation systems are designed to  
replace water lost at the highest level of E.T. for the turf grass in  
the landscape.

Irrigation system design considerations include the water supply,  
site conditions, climate, and plant material selection. The available  
volume of the water supply is measured in gallons per minute  
\(gpm\). The available pressure of the water supply is measured in  
pounds per square inch \(psi\). Water supply can be from a public or  
private utility system, or can be pumped from a well or pond.  
Selection of irrigation equipment and sizing of distribution piping is  
based on available volume and pressure of the water supply.  
Site conditions that must be considered are topography, drainage,  
soil type, and solar exposure. Important climatic conditions include

# ELEMENT G\: SITEWORK LANDSCAPING  
There are a number of common irrigation system components,  
among them\:  
• Backflow preventer \: Prevents water from the irrigation system  
from backflowing into the potable water supply.  
• Controller \: Acts as a timer that maintains status of the day of  
the week and time of the day in order to activate electric control  
valves at a specific day, time of day, and duration.  
• Main line \: The primary pipe supply line that distributes water  
from the point of connection of the source of supply to the elec-  
tric control valves. Main line piping of sizes 2-1/2 in. in diameter  
and larger are typically class 200 PVC. Piping of sizes 2 in. and  
smaller are typically schedule 40 PVC.  
• Electric control valve \: Low-voltage solenoid-actuated valves that  
control the flow of water from the main line into the lateral line  
piping. Electric control valves are activated by the controller.  
Signals are sent from the controller to the valves through direct  
burial wires.  
• Lateral line piping \: The pipe supply line that distributes water  
from an electric control valve to a sprinkler head or a drip emit-  
ter. Depending on the application, lateral line piping can be  
schedule 40 PVC, class 200 PVC, or class 160 PVC. Lateral line  
piping for drip irrigation is typically polyethylene tube.  
• Sprinkler head \: A water distribution device attached to the lat-  
eral line piping. Rotary and impact sprinkler heads are used to  
irrigate large areas and can be spaced from 20 to 80 ft o.c.  
Pop-up spray sprinkler heads are used to irrigate smaller areas  
and can be spaced from 5 to 20 ft o.c. Sprinkler heads are used  
to irrigate turf grass or broad areas of low-growing shrubs or  
ground covers. For optimum efficiency, sprinkler heads are  
spaced to provide overlapping head-to-head coverage.  
• Bubbler head \: A water-distribution device used to irrigate  
shrubs and ground covers by placing water immediately adja-  
cent to the plant, or by flooding a planting bed.  
• Drip emitter \: A water distribution device that distributes water  
very slowly, in increments measured in gallons per hour. Drip  
emitters are used to water individual plants.  
The following water conservation efforts can earn LEED credits\:  
Use water-efficient landscaping and  
reduce potable water use by 50 percent. This credit can be  
achieved by using native plant materials requiring less water  
and by properly designing an efficient irrigation system. Using  
alternative turf species and reducing the amount of turf in the  
landscape will help to reduce irrigation demand. Alternative  
water sources such as treated sewage effluent will reduce the  
demand for potable water.  
Use water-efficient landscaping and  
eliminate potable water use. Use water captured on-site, gray-  
water for irrigation, or treated effluent, or eliminate the installa-  
tion of an irrigation system completely. Innovative technologies  
should be employed for a more efficient irrigation system.  
Technologies include\:  
• Drip irrigation  
• Evapotranspiration \(E.T.\)-based controllers  
• Rain and wind shutoff devices  
• Soil moisture sensors that shut off the irrigation system when  
the soil moisture is adequate for the landscape  
• Centralized irrigation system control  
• Weather stations used to estimate evapotranspiration on a  
daily or short-term basis  
Irrigation system management is also critical to reducing water  
waste. Proper system design is essential, including designing for  
correct pressure, elevation changes, varying plant material and  
microclimates. The design should employ appropriate equipment.  
Proper system maintenance includes fixing broken sprinklers and  
drip laterals and adjusting sprinklers to minimize overspray on to  
hard surfaces. Maintenance also includes adjusting the controller  
for the season and the weather conditions. This can be accom-  
plished using an on-site weather station or with the use of public  
local weather station data or E.T. information. Features on the  
controllers include water budget capabilities; E.T. controllers  
based on historic patterns, including temperature and rain; and E.T.  
controllers based on real-time data.  
To minimize water waste, the manager must adjust the controller  
to fine-tune station operating times to match conditions for each  
irrigation lateral; employ repeat cycles, depending on soil condi-  
tions; adjust lateral operating pressures; make changes to the  
irrigation system as plant material matures; and irrigate at night  
when evaporation is lowest.

The physical environment of the site, the design needs of the proj-  
ect, and the design character of the trees are all factors that must  
be considered in selecting trees and preparing a landscape plan  
for a building.  
Soil conditions \(acidity, porosity\) at the site, the amount and inten-  
sity of sunlight and precipitation, and the seasonal temperature  
range in the area create the physical environment in which trees  
must be able to survive. In addition, it is essential to consider how  
the location and topography of the site will direct the wind, resulting  
in cold winds and cooling breezes that can affect the health of trees.

Trees can be used to address the design needs of a project by  
directing pedestrian or vehicle movement, framing vistas, screen-  
ing objectionable views, and defining and shaping exterior space.  
Trees can also be used to modify the microclimate of a site and to  
help conserve building energy use from heating, cooling, and light-  
ing systems.  
The design character of the trees themselves plays a part in which  
species are best suited for a particular application. The shape of a  
tree can be columnar, conical, spherical, or spreading, and the  
resulting height and mass will change over time as the tree  
matures. Some trees grow quickly, and others more slowly, and  
their color and texture varies from coarse to medium to fine,  
affecting their character. The appearance of deciduous trees  
changes with the seasons, while the effect of an evergreen  
remains relatively constant.  
The vertical angle of the sun changes seasonally; therefore, the  
area of a building subject to the glare of reflected sunlight varies.  
Plants of various heights can screen sun \(and artificial light\) glare  
from adjacent surfaces.  
A combination of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs  
reduces sound more effectively than deciduous plants alone.  
Planting trees and shrubs on earth mounds increases the attenuat-  
ing effects of a buffer belt.  
Shelter belt wind protection reduces evaporation at ground level,  
increases relative humidity, lowers the temperature in summer and  
reduces heat loss in winter, and reduces blowing dust and drifting  
snow. The amount of protection afforded is directly related to the  
height and density of the shelter belt.  
Mature trees absorb or delay runoff from stormwater at a rate four  
to five times that of bare ground.  
In summer, trees obstruct or filter the strong radiation from the  
sun, cooling and protecting the area beneath them. In winter,  
evergreen trees still have this effect, whereas deciduous trees,  
having lost their leaves, do not.

Planting details for trees and shrubs, tips on soil improvement, and  
general design considerations are the topics addressed in this  
section.  
These three guidelines will aid in the successful planting of trees\:  
• For container-grown trees, use fingers or small hand tools to  
pull the roots out of the outer layer of potting soil; then cut or  
pull apart any roots circling the perimeter of the container.  
Incorporate commercially prepared mycorrhiza spores in the  
soil immediately around the root ball at rates specified by the  
manufacturer.  
• During the design phase, confirm that water drains out of the  
soil; design alternative drainage systems as required.  
• Thoroughly soak the tree root ball and adjacent prepared soil  
several times during the first month after planting, and regu-  
larly throughout the following two summers.  
Note that the planting process is similar for deciduous and ever-  
green trees.  
For successful shrub planting, follow these guidelines\:  
• For container-grown shrubs, use fingers or small hand tools to  
pull the roots out of the outer layer of potting soil; then cut or  
pull apart any roots that circle the perimeter of the container.  
Incorporate commercially prepared mycorrhiza spores in the  
soil immediately around the root ball at rates specified by the  
manufacturer.  
• Confirm that water drains out of the soil during the design  
phase; design alternative drainage systems as required.

contaminated with rubble or toxic material  
20′ Remove existing soils to the widths and depths shown in

The quality of soil available for planting varies widely from site to  
site, especially after construction activity has occurred. The nature  
of construction results in compaction, filling, contamination, and  
grading of the original soil on a site, rapidly making it useless for  
planting. Previous human activity at a site can also affect the abil-  
ity of the soil to support plants.  
During the design phase, assumptions must be made regarding the  
probable condition of the soil after construction is complete. The  
health of existing or remaining soil determines what types of soil  
preparation will be required and the volume of soil to be prepared.  
Conditions will vary from location to location within a project, and  
details must be condition-specific. For large projects or extreme  
conditions, it is useful to consult an expert experienced in modify-  
ing planting soils at urban sites.  
To ensure good soil health at a project site, follow these guidelines\:  
• Whenever possible, connect the soil improvement area from  
tree to tree.  
• Always test soil for pH and nutrient levels, and adjust these as  
required.  
• Loosen soil with a backhoe or other large coarse-tilling equip-  
ment, when possible. Tilling that produces large, coarse chunks  
of soil is preferable to tilling that results in fine grains uniform  
in texture.  
• Make sure that the bottom of planting soil excavations is rough,  
to avoid matting of soil layers as new soil is added. It is prefer-  
able to till the first lift \(2 to 3 in.\) of planting soil into the subsoil.  
Traditional urban designs in which trees are regularly spaced in  
small openings within paved areas generally result in poor tree  
performance because such designs generally do not provide ade-  
quate soil for root growth, and ignore the fact that trees must  
significantly increase trunk size every year. Moreover, competition  
for space, both at ground level and below, is intense in urban  
areas.  
Although it is possible to design uncompacted soil volumes for  
trees under pavement, this is very expensive and the soil is never  
as efficient as that in open planting beds. Increasing trunk size can  
only be accommodated by using flexible materials that can change  
configuration over time. Urban designs that have flexible relation-  
ships between trees, paving, and planting beds and large areas of  
open planting soil offer the best opportunity for long-term tree  
health and lower maintenance costs.  
Areas of dense urban development leave little room for tree roots  
to develop. Large areas of pavement, competition with foundations  
and utilities for space belowground, and extensive soil compaction  
and disruption limit the amount of soil available for trees. When the  
area of ground around the tree is open to the rain and sun is less  
than 400 to 500 sq ft per tree, the following design guidelines  
should be followed to encourage the growth of large healthy trees.  
Five major parts of the tree structure must be accommodated in  
the design process\:  
• Crown growth \: The tree crown expands every growing season at  
a rate of 6 to 18 in. per year. Once the crown reaches a compet-  
ing object such as a building or another tree canopy, the canopy  
growth in that area slows and then stops. Eventually the  
branches on that side of the tree die. As the canopy expansion  
potential is reduced, the overall growth rate and tree health are  
also reduced.  
• Trunk growth \: The tree trunk expands about 1/2 to 1 in. per year.  
As the tree increases in size, the lower branches die and the  
trunk lengthens. Tree trunks move considerably in the wind,  
especially during the early years of development, and are dam-  
aged by close objects.  
• Trunk flare \: At the point at which the trunk leaves the ground,  
most tree species develop a pronounced swelling or flare as the  
tree matures. This flare grows at more than twice the rate of the  
main trunk diameter and helps the tree remain structurally stable.  
Any hard object placed in this area, such as a tree grate or confin-  
ing pavement, will either damage the tree or be moved by the  
tremendous force of this growth.  
• Zone of rapid root taper \: Tree roots begin to form in the trunk  
flare and divide several times in the immediate area around the  
trunk. In this area, about 5 to 6 ft away from the trunk, the roots  
rapidly taper from about 6 in. in diameter to about 2 in. Most  
damage to adjacent paving occurs in this area immediately  
around the tree. Keeping the zone of rapid taper free of obstruc-  
tions is important to long-term tree health. Once a tree is  
established, the zone of rapid taper is generally less susceptible  
to compaction damage than the rest of the root zone.  
• Root zone \: Tree roots grow radially and horizontally from the  
trunk and occupy only the upper layers \(12 to 24 in.\) of the soil.  
Trees in all but the most well-drained soils do not have taproots.  
A relationship exists between the amount of tree canopy and the  
volume of root-supporting soil required \(see Figure 16.98\). This  
relationship is the most critical factor in determining long-term  
tree health. Root-supporting soil is generally defined as soil with  
adequate drainage, low compaction, and sufficient organic and  
nutrient components to support the tree. The root zone must be  
protected from compaction both during and after construction.  
Root zones that are connected from tree to tree generally pro-  
duce healthier trees than isolated root zones.

The ultimate tree size is defined by the projected size of the crown  
and the diameter of the tree at breast height. For example, a 16-in.  
diameter tree requires 1000 cu ft of soil.  
If visually symmetrical tree planting is required, symmetrical soil  
volumes are also required to produce trees of similar crown size. Coarse plantings keep pedestrians out of planters. Curbs protect  
planters from pedestrians and deicing salts. Underground steam  
lines must be insulated or vented to protect planter soil.  
Young trees planted in lawn areas face substantial competition  
from the roots of grasses.

coverings that suit the purpose better, are less expensive, and  
require less maintenance over the life of the tree.  
# SELECTING PLANTS FOR ROOFTOP PLANTING  
When choosing plants for a rooftop setting, consider the factors  
outlined here\:  
• Wind tolerance \: Higher elevations and exposure to wind can  
cause defoliation and increase the transpiration rate of plants.  
High parapet walls with louvers can reduce wind velocity and  
provide shelter for plants.  
• High evaporation rate \: The drying effects of wind and sun on the  
soil in a planter reduce soil moisture rapidly. Irrigation, mulch-  
es, and moisture-holding soil additives \(diatomaceous earth or  
organic matter\) help reduce this moisture loss.  
• Rapid soil temperature fluctuation \: The variation in conduction  
capacity of planter materials results in a broad range of soil  
temperatures in planters of different materials. Cold or heat  
can cause severe root damage in certain plant species. Proper  
drainage helps alleviate this condition.  
• Topsoil \: Improve topsoil in planters to provide optimum grow-  
ing conditions for the plants selected. A general formula calls  
for adding fertilizer \(determined by soil testing\) and one part  
peat moss to five parts sandy loam topsoil. More specific  
requirements for certain varieties of plants or grasses should  
be considered.  
• Root capacity \: Choose plant species carefully, considering their  
adaptation to the size of the plant bed. If species with shallow,  
fibrous roots are used instead of species with a coarse root  
system, consult with a nursery advisor. Consider the ultimate  
maturity of the plant species when sizing a planter.  
enough for the unconsolidated soils found in planters. A second  
layer of woven filter fabric, delivered in rolls greater than 10 ft  
in width, should be installed. Tuck the fabric over the exposed  
top of the drainage material to keep soil out of the drainage  
layer.  
• Insulation \: Most planters do not require insulation; however, in  
colder climates planters with small soil volumes located over  
heated structures may require insulation. Consult local sources  
for a list of cold-hardy plants.  
Structures individually or in aggregate, involving human presence  
and use, are watersheds. They take in water and release water.  
They differ from natural watersheds in that human structures take  
in potable water and release wastewater. With rising cost and  
scarcity of potable water, the sewer solution is really no solution.  
The cleansing of the sewer water to an acceptable standard for  
further disposition in waterways and oceans has become prohibi-  
tively expensive, if done properly, and an ecological disaster, if not.  
The subject here then is wastewater management—graywater  
harvest and treatment.

There are five factors when designing rooftop plantings\:  
• Soil depth \: Minimum soil depth in a planter varies with the plant  
type\: for large trees, the soil should be 36 in. deep or 6 in.  
deeper than the root ball; for small trees, 30 in. deep; for shrubs,  
24 in. deep; and for lawns, 12 in. deep \(10 in. if irrigated\).  
• Soil volume \: To determine sufficient soil volume, refer to the  
chart included in Figure 16.99, “Soil Volume for Trees.”  
• Soil weight \: The saturated weight of normal soil mix ranges  
from 100 to 120 pcf, depending on soil type and compaction  
rate. Soils can be made lighter by adding expanded shale or  
perlite. Soils lighter than 80 pcf cannot provide structure ade-  
quate to support trees.  
• Drainage fabric \: Plastic drainage material should be a minimum  
of 1/2 in. thick. Most drainage material comes with a filter  
fabric attached, but the overlap joints provided are not wide

# ELEMENT G\: SITEWORK SELECTING PLANTS FOR ROOFTOP PLANTING  
What is graywater? It is what we create from potable water when  
we wash ourselves, our clothing, our dishes, and our foods. The  
sources of graywater in an urban watershed are kitchen sinks,  
dishwashers, washing machines, baths, showers, and bathroom  
sinks. There are caveats in the use of this graywater\: The kitchen  
sinks may need grease traps. The washing machines may need fil-  
ters. The soaps and detergents used in our watershed should be  
truly biodegradable. The garbage disposals may need to be aban-  
doned. In an urban household practicing water conservation and  
using water-conserving appliances, three-fourths of the water  
produced on a daily basis is graywater. In a 200-hundred-gallon-a-  
day household, 150 gallons of graywater awaits reuse.  
The water must be collected and treated to a level consistent with  
its intended use. If at that point the graywater is disinfected, it can  
be used on-site for all purposes, except drinking and irrigating  
edible plants. Air conditioning and flushing toilets, as well as irriga-  
tion, are appropriate uses. Further polishing of the graywater  
through multiple disinfectants, such as U/V, ozone, and/or an R/O  
system produces potable water. If the issue is merely to dispose of  
the graywater, absent a specific purpose, such as watering a veg-  
etable garden, disinfection is unnecessary.  
The standard use of graywater that is not disinfected is the irriga-  
tion of plants and trees. Irrigation is accomplished by subsurface  
distribution of the water. How the subsurface distribution is accom-  
plished is dependant on soil conditions, ranging from impermeable  
soil requiring a zero discharge system to permeable soil that will  
safely accept discharge without threatening groundwater or sensi-  
tive wetlands. An impermeable membrane may be required to  
protect groundwater. The simplest systems, where appropriate,  
discharge graywater directly to fruit trees and shrubs. In the zero-  
discharge system, the graywater may be disposed of in a designed  
planter growing bamboo or some other thirsty plant.  
A new field of endeavor exists for the landscape architect\: the  
design of an interior wash water garden or a private arboretum,  
redolent with tropical plants. How about a shower in a personal  
rain forest recycling shower water for a second shower?  
To avoid grease clogs, these pipes should be installed straight,  
avoiding any necks and depressions, and should be held to at least  
a 0.5 percent gradient.  
For small systems in which the graywater is to be put to use imme-  
diately, treatment is not as crucial. The graywater can be directed  
to a mulch bed and used for plants. However, in larger systems,  
where the graywater is not to be used immediately and must be  
stored, pretreatment is needed. Clogs and odor can result from  
solid matter suspended in the graywater. Additionally, graywater  
can contain pollutants, pathogens, heavy metals, and microorgan-  
isms. If these contents are not treated, they can break down,  
resulting in undesirable anaerobic conditions.  
How can these materials be removed? They can be removed by  
gravity \(similar to a septic tank\), by premade filter, or by gravel  
filter. The method of treatment will depend on the size of the sys-  
tem and destination of the graywater supply.  
Trickling filters consist of layers of porous materials with a lot of  
surface area. Water is dispersed over the top of the filter and  
percolates downward as a thin layer, treated aerobically as it  
passes over the surfaces of the filter materials. Via an underdrain-  
age system, the water is then collected and solids are allowed to  
settle before the water is transported to its destination site. The  
advantage to this system is that it is reliable and can recover from  
wastewater excesses. Trickling filters are not as efficient as soil  
filters, however, and they create a sludge that must be removed.  
The soil ecosystem of the destination plant bed is used to convert  
the graywater. The amount of water released into the soil should  
be configured to meet the evapotranspiration rate of the plants it  
feeds. This rate is usually between 1 to 4 gallons per square yard  
per day. If too much water is applied, saturation occurs. If too little  
water is applied, plant growth will be inhibited by lack of resourc-  
es. In either case, the plant life suffers.  
The end use of graywater can be directed to the following\:  
• Discharged to surface waters \: Graywater is discharged to sur-  
face water quite easily. After treatment, the water can be  
released into open trenches and allowed to wash away with  
rainwater.  
• Groundwater \: If it is intended to be released to groundwater,  
graywater must be well treated with a very reliable system.  
After treatment, the water should seep through an unsaturated  
soil depth of 3 ft or more before joining groundwater. In addi-  
tion, safety zones should be set around water extraction sites to  
avoid complications.  
• Irrigation \: When graywater is used in irrigation, it is best to  
apply in the ground, as opposed to being sprayed. Graywater is  
best suited in irrigation of cropland that supports plants whose  
leaves or stems are not eaten directly. Fruit and berry plants are  
appropriate. When using graywater in irrigation of crops that  
are consumed raw, it is advisable to wait at least a month after  
irrigation to harvest.  
Soil layers are used to filter the graywater before it reaches its  
destination. A soil with medium particle size should be selected.  
Soils too fine or too coarse will not allow the water to filter through  
properly. Saturation should be avoided. Some pores should be free  
for gas exchange.  
It is also important to provide for even water distribution across  
the filter. If water distribution is uneven, clogs will result and the  
filtering process will not be as effective. A well-designed soil filter  
system will have high pollutant removal efficiencies \(see Figure  
16.105\).  
Graywater is essentially wash water. It consists of all household  
wastewater, aside from toilet water \(also known as blackwater\).  
The same contents that make graywater a pollutant in some areas  
\(streams, rivers, and groundwater\) also make graywater a  
resource in others. Because graywater often contains nitrogen,  
phosphorus, and potassium \(all important nutrients for plants\), it  
is quite useful when applied to vegetation.  
Suspended solids and organic  
compounds  
90–99  
Pathogens 95–99.9

source. These pipes can be thinner than regular wastewater pipes  
because they do not have to transport toilet water and solid waste.  
30–95 \(depends on soil properties  
and water load\)  
The preventive goals of graywater treatment are to leave nearby  
areas undamaged, avoid odor and stagnant water, prevent anaero-  
bic conditions in the water, and to keep groundwater and reser-  
voirs uncontaminated. When all these goals are met, graywater  
treatment yields tremendously positive results. It can be used for  
landscaping, plant growth, and renewed groundwater. Perhaps  
most importantly, water that is treated and reused allows freshwa-  
ter in natural ecosystems to remain untouched.  
There are many laws in place regulating how graywater can be  
treated and what it can be reused for. These laws vary from state  
to state and must be reviewed and checked closely before a plan  
for graywater use is proposed and implemented. Despite legal  
barriers, many developers and scientists believe that with further  
testing and studies, graywater treatment systems will become  
more prevalent. In fact, a few companies now offer installation of  
contained \(includes a lining\), ornamental graywater gardens.

Subsurface drainage systems are very different engineering  
designs from surface drainage systems. Surface drainage systems  
intercept and collect stormwater runoff and convey it away from a  
building and site with the use of large inlets and storm drains.  
Subsurface drainage systems typically are smaller in size and  
capacity and are designed to intercept the slower underground  
flows of a natural groundwater table, underground stream, or  
infiltration of soils from surface sources. Surface and subsurface  
systems typically require discharge either through a pumping sta-  
tion or by gravity drainage to an adequate outfall.

# ELEMENT G\: SITEWORK SITE CIVIL UTILITIES  
Storm drainage utilities are designed to collect and dispose of  
rainfall runoff to prevent the flow of water from damaging building  
structures \(through foundation leakage\), site structures, and the  
surface grade \(through erosion\). The two basic types of surface  
drainage are the open system and the closed system.  
• The open system, which utilizes a ditch/swale and culvert, is  
used in less densely populated, more open areas where the flow  
of water above grade can be accommodated fairly easily.  
• The closed system, which utilizes pipes, an inlet/catch basin,  
and manholes, is used in more urban, populated areas, where  
land must be used efficiently and water brought below the sur-  
face quickly to avoid interference with human activity.  
The two systems are commonly combined where terrain, human  
density, and land uses dictate.  
A pervious or porous paving is often used for parking and other  
hard site surfaces. This drainage system allows water to percolate  
through the paved surface into the soil, similar to the way the land  
would naturally absorb water.  
persons with disabilities. Refer to applicable codes, standards,  
and regulations for accessibility requirements.  
• Lay out grades so runoff can safely flow away from buildings. If  
drains become blocked, do not allow backed-up water to accu-  
mulate around the foundation.  
• Keep in mind that an open system, or one in which water is kept  
on top of the surface as long as possible, is generally more  
economical than a closed system.  
• Consider the effect of ice forming on the surface when deter-  
mining slopes for vehicles and pedestrians.  
• Consult local codes on such criteria as intensity and duration of  
rainstorms and allowable runoff for the locality.  
When designing surface drainage systems, follow these guidelines\:  
• Lay out all slopes, grates, swales, and other drainage features  
according to the ADA, without restricting accessible routes for

section.  
for burial just below the surface. In the latter case, the soil-pea  
gravel or vegetation in the pavers is exposed and can help per-  
colate precipitation into the ground.  
To reduce runoff and increase water absorption, porous paving  
must be underlaid with a bed of unbound aggregate. The unbound  
aggregate acts as a structural support and forms a reservoir to  
hold precipitation until it can percolate into the soil. Use of porous  
paving may permit use of a significantly smaller and simpler storm  
drainage system.  
The two principal types of porous paving are monolithic surfacing  
material and unit pavers.  
• Monolithic porous paving is stone aggregate bound with asphalt  
or portland cement. The aggregate must be sorted to exclude  
the “fines” or sand-sized particles that normally fill the voids  
between larger pieces. Without the fines, water is able to run  
through the paving material. Generally, porous asphalt and  
concrete are both strong enough for parking and roadway sur-  
faces and pedestrian uses.  
• Precast concrete unit pavers , with shapes that allow water to  
flow through them, can also give surface stability for parking or  
driveways. Paver types are available for exposed placement, or  
Design considerations for working with porous paving systems  
include the following\:  
• Soils around porous paving installations must have a minimum  
percolation rate of about 1/2 in./hr, and should not be more than  
about 30 percent clay. On sites where the slope is greater than  
3 percent, terracing the paved areas allows the bottom of each  
reservoir to remain level.  
• Proper specification and supervision are important in the instal-  
lation of porous paving materials. Soil under the reservoir must  
not be unduly compacted during construction.  
• Porous concrete can withstand heavier loads than porous  
asphalt. Because it does not soften in hot weather and may be  
more susceptible to freeze/thaw damage, it is better suited to  
warmer climates. Additives may be introduced to improve cold  
climate performance.  
• Porous asphalt has good freeze/thaw resistance, but is best  
suited for areas in which traffic is limited, such as employee  
parking.  
• While clogging of monolithic porous paving is generally not a  
problem, recommended maintenance may include use of a  
hydrovac once or twice a year, as well as the prompt removal of  
leaves and windblown sand.  
• The reservoir below porous paving has no fixed depth but is  
designed according to the slope of the site, the soil percolation  
rate, and the size of the design storm. Consult a civil engineer or  
landscape architect.

# ELEMENT G\: SITEWORK SITE ELECTRICAL UTILITIES  
# SITE ELECTRICAL UTILITIES  
Creating good design for site lighting is not just about picking the  
latest technology or the best fixture. It is about using lighting to  
convey the overall story of a project. The story may be one of  
safety in a casino parking lot or it may be one of excitement in an  
outdoor mall where visitors can gather with their families for an  
evening to have dinner and see a movie.  
Site lighting design requirements vary from project to project, and  
so need to be defined with the individual project team prior to  
preparing a design. Site lighting requirements typically include  
lighting pedestrian pathways, landscaping, landscape features,  
water features, and architectural features such as statuary and  
adjacent public roadways, parking areas, and nearby facades.  
Site lighting design, at its core, is about lighting the environment in  
a manner that responds to the desired function of the guests within  
the space. There may be multiple functions such as wayfinding,  
creating gathering spaces, interacting with the organic and built  
environments, and meeting security requirements, which all must  
be taken into account. The overall design intent of the space must  
allow for these functions to coexist seamlessly, or the guest experi-  
ence will be negative.  
As a part of the design preparation, designers will want to familiar-  
ize themselves with the landscape design and current foliage  
specifications on the project. Lighting fixtures can be used to  
highlight trees, accent shrubbery, and be mounted in trees to light  
the path below. It is important to know which trees are deciduous  
and which trees retain their canopies when making these determi-  
nations. It is also highly recommended that lighting designers work  
closely with the landscape architect to understand which trees will  
allow the attachment of lighting hardware and mounting straps.  
Once the site lighting tasks and requirements have been deter-  
mined, the designer can begin selecting fixtures, determining lamp  
types, and preparing the layout.  
and the current lighting levels in the surrounding and adjacent  
areas. The International Dark-Sky Association \(IDA\) is a nonprofit  
group whose mission is “to preserve and protect the nighttime  
environment and our heritage of dark skies through quality outdoor  
lighting.” This association \(www.darksky.org \) has been an active  
voice in the creation of many of the local dark-sky ordinances.  
Several calculation programs are available to help verify the illumi-  
nance levels are being met in the site lighting design. AGI32 \(www.  
agi32.com \) is commonly used for site lighting studies, as is  
LumenMicro by Lighting Technologies \(www.lighting-technologies.  
com \).  
The most difficult part of creating a good lighting design is to meet  
all of the functional and code requirements of a site while mixing  
in the desired aesthetics of the project. Providing the right night-  
time identity for a site is key to making any project a success.  
CPTED recommendations state that lighting has two purposes\:  
illumination of human activity and security. All pedestrian walk-  
ways and access routes should be illuminated a minimum of 4  
Footcandles to meet IES minimum standards.  
Other factors to consider when designing site lighting are local and  
national energy codes, any locality-specific dark-sky ordinances,

norms, and this has enabled the orders to grow and evolve in  
important ways.  
The elements of classical architecture, which we inherited from the  
ancient Greeks, have been in constant use and continual evolution  
for over 2000 years. They consist of the various columns, along  
with their bases and capitals, beams, and decorative moldings.  
These elements are used in harmony with one another and their  
use is governed by rules of proportion and specifics of ornamental  
detail. These are referred to as “the classical orders of architec-  
ture.” It is generally accepted that there are five such orders that  
have been classified since the Renaissance\: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic,  
Corinthian, and Composite \(a combination of Corinthian and Ionic\).  
The orders themselves, of which there were four identified in  
Roman times, were first described as such by Pollio Vitruvius, the  
architect and theoretician who wrote an architectural treatise in  
Augustan Roman times in 30–20 B.C. It was not until the  
Renaissance that interest in the accurate interpretation and use of  
the classical forms was revived in the treatises of Leon Battista  
Alberti \(1450\) and Sebastiano Serlio \(1537\). The work of both was  
a revival of Vitruvius, but also significantly went back to the actual  
Roman sources. The physical remains of Roman buildings were  
then being rapidly plundered and recycled in Renaissance build-  
ings, so the appropriation of design elements was completely in  
keeping. It was Serlio who first codified five orders of classical  
architecture\: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite.  
Again in Summerson’s words\:  
Through most of the life of Architectural Graphic Standards since  
its first edition in 1932, there had been no specific section of  
details of the orders until 1988, when the eighth edition of Graphic  
Standards published a two-page spread. This was then expanded in  
the ninth edition \(1994\) to six pages and so it remained in the tenth  
edition. Given the underlying technical-, detail-oriented focus of  
Architectural Graphic Standards it may not have been seen as part  
of its mission to incorporate information of such a fundamentally  
design-oriented aspect, since this information was readily avail-  
able elsewhere in greater detail. With the twelfth edition we are  
again incorporating the essential graphic information about the  
orders and how to compose and delineate them and have added  
information about the history, meaning, and uses of the orders in  
the past, present, and future.  
“There is, however, one point about this rather abstract conception  
of what is classical and it may be put as a question. Is it possible,  
you may ask, for a building to display absolutely none of the trap-  
pings associated with classical architecture and still, by virtue of  
proportion alone, to qualify as a ‘classical’ building? The answer  
must, I think, be ‘no’. You can say, in describing such a building,  
that its proportions are classical, but it is simply confusing and an  
abuse of terminology to say that it is classical. The porches of  
Chartres Cathedral are, in distribution and proportion, just about  
as classical as you can get, but nobody is ever going to call them  
anything but Gothic.  
The fact is that the essentials of architecture—as expounded by  
the Renaissance—are to be found expressed, consciously or  
unconsciously, throughout the architectures of the world. And  
while we must incorporate these essentials in our idea of what is  
classical we must also accept the fact that classical architecture is  
only recognizable as such when it contains some allusion, however  
slight, however vestigial, to the antique ‘orders’. Such an allusion  
may be no more than some groove or projection which suggests  
the idea of a cornice or even a disposition of windows which sug-  
gests the ratio of pedestal to column, column to entablature. Some  
modern buildings—notably those of the late August Perret and his  
imitators—are classical in this way\: that is to say, they are thought  
out in modern materials but in a classical spirit and sealed as clas-  
sical only by the tiniest allusive gestures.”11

In using and understanding the orders it is important to accept  
that they are not a static unchanging formula to be memorized  
and applied exactly by rote. Like a language, or any other means  
of sophisticated expression, it is not so much the specifics of the  
“words” that the orders represent, but rather that they provide a  
highly sophisticated grammatical language which can be used in  
many different modes of expression. Over time they have had a  
rich variety of sources and inspirations and have evolved in many  
different ways as well. First, they owe their initial existence and  
form through reference to actual buildings of the ancient world.  
Second, it is through codification and propagation throughout  
history that they have endured. Third, at key moments, individual  
architects have adapted and “swerved” from the accepted  
The orders present a sophisticated compositional system which is  
precisely governed by principles of proportion and harmony between  
parts. Each of the five orders has its own particular rules of propor-  
tion and characteristics controlling which parts and elements are  
used with each order. The key aspects of this are the proportion of  
each element \(column diameter to height, base to column, column to  
entablature, for example\) as well as how the repetitive elements are  
placed \(intercolumniation\). These principals are not arbitrary, but  
are based both on historical precedent and aesthetic principals of  
beauty and composition. Historically, the Doric order with its stout  
columns and narrow spaces between columns represented the  
prevailing conservatism of structural design, which by the time of  
the Ionic order, had evolved permitting more structurally daring use  
of more slender columns and longer spans.  
The design principals of proportion and composition that under-  
lie the orders are important in all aspects of design concerned  
with the appearance and perception of a structure. These princi-  
pals remain important to us as designers even if we are not  
intent on creating a building which can be strictly defined as  
“classical.” Classicism has been employed on a widely varying  
spectrum of literalness as to the use of its form, and particu-  
larly during the first half of the twentieth century practitioners  
like Auguste Perret in France and Marcello Piacentini in Italy  
showed that a relatively stripped form of classicism could still  
express monumentality, permanence, and stability. Summerson  
argues that the mere presence of columns, capitals, moldings,  
and the other typical elements of classicism do not always  
represent classicism if specific forms are absent\:  
It is in two contexts and with two objectives that this revised pre-  
sentation of the orders is offered\: First, in the spirit of all other  
solutions and details provided in Architectural Graphic Standards,  
these orders are intended for use by those who practice classical  
architecture—a group always growing in number. Second, the  
ideas and sensibilities which the orders represent have a rele-  
vance that goes far beyond the practices of classical architecture  
and in fact applies to all practitioners who wish to touch upon  
human perception and empathic response to habitation.  
Classical architecture is based on five distinct and formalized sys-  
tems of columns and horizontal supports, called the orders. A  
proportional system in which the parts and divisions of each order,  
measured in multiples or divisions of the diameter of the lowest  
part of the relevant tapered column shaft, distinguishes each  
unique order.

To establish uniform practice among designers, it is desirable to  
present a list of materials generally used in building construction,  
together with their proper weights. Many building codes prescribe  
the minimum weights of only a few building materials. It should be  
noted that there is a difference of more than 25 percent in some  
cases.

When a light ray traveling through a transparent medium strikes  
another transparent medium, part of the ray is reflected and part  
is refracted, entering the second medium. The angle of the  
refracted ray depends on the angle of incidence and the index of  
refraction of both mediums.

When light attempts to move from a medium with a high index of  
refraction to a medium with a low index of refraction, there is a  
particular angle of incidence large enough that the angle of refrac-  
tion reaches 90°. The transmitted light ray moves parallel to the  
surface of the first medium and no more light is transmitted.  
This angle of incidence is called the critical angle and depends on  
the indexes of refraction of the two mediums. Any angle of inci-  
dence larger than the critical angle is reflected back into the first  
medium.

The architectural area of a building is the sum of the areas of the  
floors, measured horizontally in plan to the exterior faces of perim-  
eter walls or to the centerline of walls separating buildings.  
Included are areas occupied by partitions, columns, stairwells,  
elevator shafts, duck shafts, elevator rooms, pipe spaces, mechan-  
ical penthouses, and similar spaces having headroom of 6 ft. and  
over. Areas of sloping surfaces, such as staircases, bleachers, and  
tiered terraces, should be measured horizontally in plan.  
Auditoriums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, foyers, and similar  
spaces extending through two or more floors should be measured  
once only, taking the largest area in plan at any level.  
Mechanical penthouse rooms, pipe spaces, bulkheads, and similar  
spaces having a headroom less than 6 ft. and balconies projecting  
beyond exterior walls, covered terraces and walkways, porches,  
and similar spaces shall have the architectural area multiplied by  
0.50 in calculating the building gross area.  
Exterior staircases and fire escapes, exterior steps, patios, ter-  
races, open courtyards and light wells, roof overhangs, cornices  
and chimneys, unfinished roof and attic areas, pipe trenches, and  
similar spaces are excluded from the architectural area calcula-  
tions. Interstitial space in healthcare facilities is also excluded.  
4" solid plaster The architectural volume of a building is the sum of the products  
of the areas defined in the architectural area times the height from  
the underside of the lowest floor construction to the average  
height of the surface of the finished roof above, for the various  
parts of the building. Included in the architectural volume is the  
actual space enclosed within the outer surfaces of the exterior of  
outer walls and contained between the outside of the roof and the  
bottom of the lowest floor, taken in full\: bays, oriels, dormers;  
penthouses, chimneys; walk tunnels; enclosed porches and balco-  
nies, including screened areas.  
The following volumes are multiplied by 0.50 in calculating the  
architectural volume of a building; nonenclosed porches, if  
recessed into the building and without enclosing sash or screens;  
nonenclosed porches built as an extension to the building and  
without sash or screen; areaways and pipe tunnels; and patio

areas that have building walls extended on two sides, roof over,  
and paved surfacing.  
Excluded from the architectural volume are outside steps, terrac-

The net assignable area is that portion of the area that is available  
for assignment to an occupant, including every type of space  
usable by the occupant.  
The net assignable area should be measured from the predominant  
inside finish of enclosing walls in the categories defined below.  
Areas occupied by exterior walls, partitions, internal structural, or  
party walls are to be excluded from the groups and are to be  
included under “construction area.”  
1\. Net assignable area \: Total area of all enclosed spaces fulfilling  
the main functional requirements of the building for occupant  
use, including custodial and service areas such as guard rooms,  
workshops, locker rooms, janitors’ closets, storerooms, and the  
total area of all toilet and washroom facilities.  
2\. Circulation area \: Total area of all enclosed spaces which is  
required for physical access to subdivision of space such as  
corridors, elevator shafts, escalators, fire towers or stairs,  
stairwells, elevator entrances, public lobbies, and public  
vestibules.  
3\. Mechanical area \: Total area of all enclosed spaces designed to  
house mechanical and electrical equipment and utility services  
such as mechanical and electrical equipment rooms, duct shafts,  
boiler rooms, fuel rooms, and mechanical service shafts.  
4\. Construction area \: The area occupied by exterior walls, parti-  
tions, and structure.  
5\. Gross floor or architectural area \: The sum of areas 1, 2, 3, and  
4 plus the area of all factored non- and semi-enclosed areas  
equal the gross floor area or architectural area of a building.  
In commercial buildings constructed for leasing, net areas are to  
be measured in accordance with the “Standard Method of Floor  
Measurement,” as set by the Building Owners and Managers  
Association \(BOMA\).  
The net rentable area for offices is to be measured from the inside  
finish of permanent outer building walls, to the office or occupancy  
side of corridors and/or other permanent partitions, and to the  
center of partitions that separate the premises from adjoining rent-  
able areas. No deductions are to be made for columns and projec-  
tions necessitated by the building.  
The net rentable area for stores is to be measured from the build-  
ing line in case of street frontages and from the inside finish of  
other outer building walls, corridor, and permanent partitions and  
to the center of partitions that separate the premises from adjoin-  
ing rentable areas. No deductions are to be made for vestibules  
inside the building line or for columns that are projections neces-  
sary to the building. No addition is to be made for projecting bay  
windows.  
If a single occupant is to occupy the total floor in either the office  
or store categories, the net rentable area would include the acces-  
sory area for that floor of corridors, elevator lobbies, toilets, jani-  
tors’ closets, electrical and telephone closets, air-conditioning  
rooms and fan rooms, and similar spaces.  
The net rentable area for apartments is to be measured from the  
inside face of exterior walls, and all enclosing walls of the unit.  
Various government agencies have their own methods of calculat-  
ing the net assignable area of buildings. They should be investi-  
gated if federal authority of funding applies to a project. Also,  
various building codes provide their own definitions of net and  
gross areas of buildings for use in quantifying requirements.
