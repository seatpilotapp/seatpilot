# The Practical Guide to Managing Event Venues  
This is a short, accessible and practical guide to running venues which are in the  
business of hosting events. Using honest guidance peppered with the author’s  
real-life situational anecdotes to contextualise the topics, the book is logically  
structured around the key stages of event management\: pre-event, onsite and  
post-event. Topics covered include developing the client relationship, marketing,  
financial accountability, risk, interdepartmental communication, onsite proce-  
dures and post-event evaluation. This is a fundamental resource for all event  
management and hospitality students. It is also a book for anybody who man-  
ages a venue or is a venue event manager. The Practical Guide to Managing Event  
Venues makes the business of venue management appealing, understandable and  
achievable.  
Philip Berners has been the event manager at high-profile venues, including the  
London Hippodrome, Camden Palace and Thorpe Park. He has also organised  
events in a range of venues in the UK, Poland, Portugal and Italy. His knowl-  
edge of using venues for events extends to public parks, royal parks, conference  
centres, nightclubs, hotels, restaurants, sports centres, exhibition halls, country  
houses and disused warehouses. He is currently lecturer and course coordinator  
for the BA Hons Events Management programme at the Edge Hotel School, Uni-  
versity of Essex, UK. The Practical Guide to

mouth. At 27 he was put in charge of the opening of the first ever river cruise  
ship operating in Italy. By 30 he was Deputy Hotel Director on the Silver Sea,  
achieving the award of ‘most luxurious ship’ by Condé. In recent years, and after  
managing one of London’s best established Italian restaurants in Chelsea, Dim-  
itri’s ambition to teach and his passion for hospitality led him to the position of

# The management of  
event venues Chapter 1  
# What is a venue?  
1.1 Definition of venue  
In my first book of this series, The Practical Guide to Organising Events, I defined an  
event as any live happening.  
A venue is where a live happening takes place.  
If the live happening is not an accident or incident, but is planned \(events man-  
agement is the planning of live happenings\), then the venue is an event venue –  
even if it is used for a one-off event.  
1.2 Types of venue  
Now we understand what a venue is, we can identify various types of venue where  
events take place.  
1.2.1 Dedicated venues  
A dedicated venue is a place constructed for the purpose of staging or hosting  
events – we may call this type of venue a purpose-built venue.  
This type of venue would usually be built specifically for a certain type of event,  
such as a conference centre for hosting conferences, or a sports stadium for host-  
ing sporting events. 4 The management of event venues  
Being a venue built for purpose, the architect would design the facility specifically  
for the needs of that type of event. For example\:  
Type of venue Design features  
Conference centre Large foyers for delegate registration  
Main conference hall  
Breakout meeting rooms  
Stage  
Sound, lighting and projection facilities  
Translation booths  
Multiple bars  
Buffet/dining areas  
Otherwise, it could be a purpose-built multi-purpose venue, such as modern-day  
sports stadia which are now designed to facilitate the business of all events, not  
just sporting. Nowadays, a sports stadium will incorporate conference facilities,  
banqueting suites and nightclubs.  
1.2.2 Non-dedicated venues  
This type of venue is not built for the purpose of events. This could be an art  
gallery, nightclub, museum, library or any other building that could host an event  
due to its size, location, facilities or interesting architecture, but the primary pur-  
pose of the building is not events.  
Venues that are not built for the purpose of events will most often have a core  
business that is not events driven. In such venues, their events business is sec-  
ondary. These are ‘part-time’ event venues, then.  
Within this category, could also be included pubs, bars and restaurants because  
their main purpose of business is that of retailing food and drink. Yet, most pubs  
host social events, such as quiz nights, live music, and New Year’s Eve parties,  
and most restaurants host parties, wedding banquets and private dining rooms.  
Even so, this does not make them dedicated event venues.  
An example of this type of venue would be the Natural History Museum in ­ London –  
which, although was not constructed for the purpose of hosting events, but for  
housing and displaying museum exhibits – does host an extraordinary number of  
corporate parties, weddings, conferences, fashion shows, and filming. Its primary  
role as a museum means that this particular venue is open to the public every day  
from 10\:00 until 17\:30. Thus, the Natural History Museum hosts events as a second-  
ary contribution to its core business. As with most such venues, the Natural History  
Museum splits its role to accommodate events outside its usual operating hours. What is a venue? 5  
Even if a palace, castle or historic house were now purpose-run for events –  
as many are these days for weddings, team-building activities, small  
­ conferences – and events have become the primary income, it would be wrong  
to categorise this venue as being dedicated because it cannot be assumed  
that all palaces, castles and historic houses are run solely for the purpose of  
events. Besides, a palace, castle or historic house was not built for the purpose  
of events.  
A non-dedicated event venue may also be a ‘green-field’ site, such as a public park  
hosting an open-air concert, funfair or festival.  
Note\: A ‘green-field’ site is not necessarily a parkland or grassy area, but is the  
generic term applied to a venue where limited or no facilities exist. Green-field  
sites can be empty buildings, disused factories, warehouses, car parks or any-  
where where no facilities or services exist in situ. Indeed, in many cases, green-  
field sites do not have electricity, water, drainage or toilet facilities.  
Where there are basic facilities, the venue would be termed as a ‘brown-field’  
site.  
Examples of dedicated and non-dedicated venues  
Dedicated Non-dedicated  
Hotels Green-field sites  
Conference centres Historic houses  
Sports stadia Museums  
Banqueting halls Public libraries  
Exhibition halls Castles  
Palaces  
Pubs, bars, restaurants  
Nightclubs  
theatres  
Country house hotels 6 The management of event venues  
Examples of popular events held at non-dedicated  
venues  
Chelsea Flower Show held at the Royal Hospital Chelsea  
Hampton Court Flower Show held at Hampton Court Palace  
The Route of Kings Concerts held at Hyde Park  
The BAFta Awards held at the Royal Opera House  
The Hay Literary Festival held at marquees at Hay on Wye  
Glastonbury Festival held at a working dairy farm  
1.2.3 Unusual venues  
There are certain venues that fall into the unusual venue category \(otherwise  
referred to as special venues\). These are places that can already be identified as  
non-dedicated venues, but also they would rarely host events or may never have  
hosted an event.  
So, whereas the Natural History Museum in London is non-dedicated for events,  
it has become adept at hosting many events and has an events team; it has  
well-practiced events procedures; and it has a portfolio of trusted suppliers, such  
as technical providers and event catering companies. It is important to note here  
that an events team in a venue such as this would be experienced in client han-  
dling and events management.  
The difference which makes an unusual venue, is a non-dedicated venue that does  
not have an events team because the premises are not usually used for events.  
Therefore, none of the staff would have events experience, the venue is not prac-  
ticed in managing and handling events, and there would be no chain of trusted  
events suppliers.  
The question may arise as to why a client would seek an unusual venue. It would  
be because the client wants somewhere unusual – somewhere that is unique, and  
where no other client has yet held an event. What is a venue? 7  
Such unusual venues may be country houses, warehouses, private estates, dis-  
used buildings, barns, or any place of architectural interest.  
1.3 The demand for unusual venues  
In simple economic terms, demand drives need. Creativity is the new need. So,  
event clients have learnt to search for more exciting, more innovative and more  
interesting venues.  
And, it is an upward spiral\: the more adventurous a client is with choosing a  
venue one year, so their need is to be even more adventurous the following year.  
This does not mean that if a venue is traditional or is a dedicated events venue  
it will lose out to unusual or non-dedicated venues. What it does mean is that  
all venues need to provide their clients and guests with a top-quality event ex-  
perience. Otherwise, the venue – dedicated or otherwise – will lose business to  
its competitors. In today’s event marketplace, where all buildings are potential  
venues, all other buildings are competitors.  
So, achieving bookings through events is ever more an aggressive and increas-  
ingly competitive market. Venues have to try harder. They need to create their  
reputation for good event handling, and protect it. They require knowledgeable  
and trained events staff to attract and retain events business… And, so the events  
industry is self-regulating. It is evolving and getting better at it. There are quali-  
fications in events management now – it has become a career! Chapter 2  
# The Berners hierarchy  
# of event needs  
The demand for venues is driven for the following reasons, which we may call  
‘The Berners Hierarchy of Event Needs’.  
1 A need to avoid traditional event venues, particularly hotels. In event circles,  
hotels represent lazy and boring events \(this is discussed further in Chapter 3\).  
2 The need to excel the previous event. If the event occurs annually – a Christ-  
mas party or a yearly conference, say – the company or client will need to  
excel the previous year’s event experience.  
3 The need to outdo competitors. Where a company’s competitor is providing  
an event for their clients, there is a need to outdo the competition.  
4 To continue the need for newness, excitement, progression and growth. If  
a company is innovative, and is growing and improving, it will not want its  
events to remain staid and non-progressive.  
5 The need to reflect the company’s profile. Often, the client will seek a venue which  
reflects the company profile. So, a company that designs expensive contemporary  
furniture, say, would not choose to place their event in a rundown local hotel.  
6 The need to entertain guests in a surprising and exciting environment. An-  
other reflection of a company’s dynamics, clients strive to project the core  
values of the business by choosing unusual venues for their events. The Berners hierarchy of event needs 9  
7 The need to generate word-of-mouth success. Clients need their event guests  
to be talking about a memorable event, and what a wonderful and exciting  
event they attended.  
8 To provide the ‘need’ for guests to attend the event. A poorly attended event  
would be a negative reflection of a company’s success. So, the venue needs  
to be exciting, interesting and otherwise inaccessible so as to help with the  
‘need to attend’ factor. It also drives the need for guests to receive an invita-  
tion for next year’s event, and confirm their attendance.  
9 The need to add value to the event. An exciting and fascinating venue adds  
value to the guest experience.  
10 The need to provide guests with a unique experience. Corporate event clients  
do not wish to follow trends – they wish to set trends.  
11 The need to achieve press coverage. High-profile events tend to book unusual  
venues to heighten press interest and coverage.  
Author’s voice box  
Recently, a publishing company with offices in central London flew its  
sales team to Monaco for a two-day conference.  
Clearly, there are many suitable venues in London, itself – within walking  
distance of the publisher’s offices, certainly. If not in London, there are  
venues to choose throughout the UK.  
Yet, the decision was taken to outlay the expense, fly the entire sales  
team to Monaco, have dinner at a beachside restaurant and play a few  
roulette chips at the famous Monte Carlo casino.  
Why?  
For the *experience.*  
Over recent years, the events industry has noticeably shifted from traditional  
venues, to doing just about anything, just about anywhere.  
This makes for exciting events and unbridled creativity, which is a good thing.  
For event services providers and particularly for venues, the fact that events are  
no longer hidden in dedicated venues means it is boon time. 10 The management of event venues  
It has driven the growth of the events industry and related service providers\:  
specialist event organisers, production companies, marquee suppliers, outside  
catering companies, furniture hire companies, mobile toilet facilities, electricity  
and water suppliers, decorators, stage hire, sound and lighting hire companies,  
crew and riggers, temporary fencing, security, logistics companies, transporta-  
tion drivers …  
The emergence of events from the traditional venues has also opened opportu-  
nities for event management as a career choice. People are now more exposed to  
events, which inspires them to enter the business of events management.  
The diversity of event venues also allows people to work with events in a variety  
of locations and a range of environments – museums, art galleries, shopping cen-  
tres, palaces – whereas at one time event management was limited to dedicated  
venues – conference centres, sports stadia, or hotels.  
One does not need to look for events or come across them by accident – they  
now happen everywhere. Chapter 3  
# Hotels as venues  
# for events  
Some time ago, events were held only in hotels. In those days it was unthinka-  
ble to search for unusual venues because hotels have everything one needs for  
an event– banquet rooms, ballrooms, dance floors, furniture, technical facilities,  
bars, kitchens and catering, waiters and bar staff …  
Hotels of good repute also have quality management who are experienced and  
trained. Hotel management courses predate events management courses by a  
long way, so most good hotels have qualified management, too.  
And, hotels have dedicated departments for handling events – the ‘conference and  
banqueting’ \(C&B\) department.  
Considering these attributes, why would an event client look outside the world of  
hotels that could facilitate the needs, and all in one place?  
Well, hotels are too convenient, and this has become their downfall.  
The one-size-fits-all nature of hotels to meet the needs of a range clients \(a range  
of budgets; and a range of type of event, such as conference clients or banquet  
clients\) means hotel décor is designed to be generic. This is why hotel banquet-  
ing and conference suites are notoriously bland and nondescript. These types of 12 The management of event venues  
spaces do not allow for the creativity of events. For one thing, hotel event suites  
are most often low-ceilinged which prevents the creativity of events where height  
is needed for projection, fog machines, balloon nets, confetti canons, snow ma-  
chines and lighting effects.  
The all-in-one-place nature of hotels has created a problem, too. Because everything  
is available in situ, hotels can keep costs low because everything is onsite. A hotel  
does not have the costs of hiring in from third parties, and there are no hire or  
transportation costs. Because hotels own their facilities, they can either waive ad-  
ditional charges or choose how much to charge, according to each client’s budget.  
This has led to a perception in the events industry that if it is a low-budget event,  
get it into a hotel.  
Event clients do not want to be seen as ‘cheap’, or that their budget is miserly.  
For this reason, clients are beginning to insist that their event is not placed in to  
a hotel.  
It should be noted that in times of recession or financial crisis, keeping the event costs low  
can project a positive connotation.  
There is another barrier to placing events in to hotels. The fact that a hotel has  
everything in-house means there is little or no ability for a specialist event or-  
ganiser to make money from their client. Yes, an event organiser will charge an  
event management fee, but additional revenue is achieved through the creative  
elements. And, if an event organiser is using trusted and loyal suppliers such as  
technicians, florists, furniture hire or caterers, there is room for mark-up and  
commissions. If the hotel is providing it all, the event organiser loses the oppor-  
tunities for additional revenue. For this reason, many specialist event organisers  
will avoid placing their clients in to hotels.  
On top of all this, hotels are notorious for poaching event clients from event  
organisers. By nature and necessity, hotels deploy aggressive sales techniques  
to meet targets for bedroom sales and food and beverage sales. Events is just  
another department, and it has its targets to achieve, too. Internal \(and external\)  
benchmarking determines performance measurement key performance indica-  
tors which push departmental managers into aggressive sales techniques. So, a  
specialist event organiser will not always wish to introduce their client to a hotel  
where everything is provided – including a client account manager, probably. It is  
easy for a hotel to convince a client that the hotel can ‘do it all’, and everything  
is already here anyway, so why pay additionally for a specialist event organiser?  
It may be seen from the above, that the problems with events in hotels are of their  
own making. It could be viewed that hotels have created their own barriers which Hotels as venues for events 13  
prevent clients from booking their event into a hotel, or for an events specialist to  
take their client in to a hotel.  
But, there is still need and demand for events in hotels – and always will there be.  
Hotels of good repute do provide the comfort and certainty of consistent stand-  
ards and quality, and experienced and qualified staff and management. They  
will most certainly be practised in client handling and events management as  
well.  
Sometimes, the event budget will be restricted, thus it makes sense to take the  
event to a place that has most or all elements in situ. And, where a venue has  
everything available in-house, the logistics and effort is much simpler – wed-  
ding clients who are unfamiliar with organising an event, like hotels for this  
reason.  
Or, the requirements of the event make a hotel the most suitable and relevant  
venue. A conference that requires theatre-style rows of chairs in a large audito-  
rium, a range of breakout rooms for splinter meetings, and overnight accommo-  
dation for the delegates, would make a hotel the obvious choice.  
In fact, hotels are the obvious choice for any type of event which requires over-  
night accommodation for guests.  
The requirement for bedrooms brings us to the ‘need’ factor. And, largely it is the  
‘need’ of the event which determines choosing a hotel for an event, not the want  
or desire to do so.  
It is this ‘need’ that hotels are relying upon now that the trend for events is more  
creative and clients are asking for unusual venues instead of hotels.  
It could be that hotels do not yet realise they have lost the ‘desire’ for events to  
be placed into this type of venue. Even if this is a realisation, they may not know  
how to get it back.  
Note here that not all hotels are dedicated event venues. Those hotels that were  
not purpose-built, such as country houses that are now hotels, are non-dedicated  
venues.  
3.1 How hotels can recapture events business  
In times long past, hotels were places to sleep. But, hotels have evolved into di-  
verse brand categories to meet the change in demand and need of guests\: star  
rated; AA rated; budget; luxury; boutique; country house; resort hotels. 14 The management of event venues  
Diversification has even taken place within hotels and they now provide cafes,  
bistros, brasseries, fine dining restaurants, lounges, meeting places, conferences,  
banquets, weddings, awards ceremonies and other events. Even bedrooms are  
now diverse, including standard rooms, executive rooms, balcony rooms and  
suites.  
Hotels have long been known for the add-ons to their accommodation service –  
­ diversifying the core business to provide revenue streams from other sources, such  
as food and drink, casinos, nightclubs, swimming pools, leisure ­ facilities, meet-  
ing rooms, conference spaces and banqueting halls. All of which are ­ extensions  
to the core business of providing a place to sleep.  
One might argue with reason that a hotel is obliged to provide food and drink  
because hotel guests require breakfast and perhaps an evening meal. But,  
it is not uncommon to find hotels without dining facilities, but with a res-  
taurant and bar adjacent which is also a non-residential offering. Anyway,  
the ­ basic catering needs of guests now extends to offer a lobby bar, roof-  
top bar, wine bar, café, bistro and a la carte restaurant. Even celebrity chefs  
are putting their name to hotel restaurants so as to drive business into this  
diversification.  
It was natural organic growth for events to become yet another extension of a  
hotel’s offering, driven by demand. As already identified in this book, hotels have  
most event facilities in situ – kitchens, bars, cleaning staff, waiting staff, cloak-  
rooms, toilets, and guest bedrooms for overnight stays, of course.  
In countries with an undeveloped events industry, hotels may still be the main  
venues for hosting events. But, this will not last very long. Even in those mar-  
kets, hotels are already experiencing the situation of no longer attracting creative  
events with high-end budgets. Soon, they will find themselves struggling to at-  
tract even the mainstay conferences, presentations and dinners – unless there is  
the need for bedrooms.  
Developing markets follow the trends of developed markets, so this is not merely  
conjecture, but the evaluation of an industry trend.  
The need to get away from the traditional event venue and provide guests with  
the Berners hierarchy of event needs \(outlined in Chapter 2\) is an ongoing driver for  
clients to search for venues other than hotels.  
In turn, event clients are becoming more educated and experienced in how to  
approach and organise events in non-dedicated and unusual venues. Also, guests’  
expectations have risen as they have been exposed to the unlimited potential of  
attending more exciting and creative events. Hotels as venues for events 15  
The ongoing rejection of using hotels for events has gradually led to them falling  
out of fashion on the venues circuit. The attitude seems to be that hotels were  
once the way of hosting conferences, seminars, meetings and banquets.  
But, there will always be demand for events in hotels. Bedrooms are often a factor  
in the requirements of an event client. But, the event’s budget is always going to  
be a decisive factor when choosing the venue. Hotels have the ability to provide  
most of the standard needs of an event without additional expense and the cost  
of hire. Also, is the need for quality space in the right locations – and city centre  
hotels meet this need.  
Many hotels occupy strategic locations in city centres, or picturesque rural loca-  
tions, or at busy intersections. This is another reason for them to attract events  
business. Many hotels themselves are the local landmark, which makes for a  
recognisable location for an event and is easy for guests to find.  
Reliability is a factor, too. There are no chains of event venues, but there are  
plenty of hotel chains. This enables an event organiser to know the levels of  
standards and services they will receive at a hotel within a particular chain, in  
whichever city or country the event takes place. If this is an international client or  
the event is to take place in various locations at home or abroad, the consistency  
of a hotel chain is invaluable. It also allows for the potential to negotiate the cost  
of a series of bookings.  
Many hotels have managed to develop their brand to be synonymous with  
top-quality events. Both the Grosvenor House hotel and the Dorchester hotel on  
London’s Park Lane are prime examples of this. Each hotel is a luxury-end estab-  
lishment which also hosts events to the extent that these hotels are renowned  
event venues. If the event is at The Grosvenor House or The Dorchester, it will be  
a high-quality event because of the quality of hotel, the location … and budget.  
The hotel industry is itself adapting to the shift in event demands. Most hotel  
chains have begun to identify the threat of competition from a closely related  
industry which has evolved rapidly and is having negative impacts on hotel levels  
of business. Here, is an example where an industry has diversified, devolved and  
is under threat. Hotels are a victim of their own success – what was once held  
within, is now an external beast with sharp teeth.  
Waking up to this scenario – albeit slowly – hotels are offering incentives to cor-  
porate clients, such as club membership rewards and loyalty discounts.  
Hotels also offer discounted accommodation if the event takes place in their ban-  
queting rooms. Or, they will provide free accommodation for key stakeholders,  
such as the event organiser or the client. Event organisers can also negotiate 16 The management of event venues  
discounted room rates for event staff and crew. In addition, hotels have the abil-  
ity to offer add-on facilities within the package price, such as a technical adviser,  
lighting engineer, sound technician, account manager, event manager, projection  
equipment, breakout rooms … \(or they may charge extra for these\).  
So, there are benefits and rewards for event organisers and clients to choose a  
­ hotel as the venue to hold their event. But, these incentives – although more  
available – were always there for loyal corporate clients. They do their job in win-  
ning business, but it is not enough in a rapidly changing landscape.  
Hotels need to capitalise on what they offer, which alternative event venues can-  
not. These should include the following\:  
• Regulated standards in an industry that has well-established and long-standing  
education, apprenticeships and qualifications.  
• Guaranteed professionalism drawn from personnel who are trained and ex-  
perienced in the transferable skills of hospitality provision, such as customer  
service; catering; cleanliness; staff leadership.  
• Highly regulated health and safety practices.  
• Adherence to well-evolved legislation.  
Events which take place in non-dedicated and unusual venues expose the client  
and event organiser – and the guests – to risks. There are no guarantees that  
management and staff at such venues are experienced, knowledgeable and quali-  
fied to the extent of those whom are employed in a hotel of good repute.  
The client or event organiser cannot even be confident that dedicated venues  
which are built for the purpose of events offer the specialism of reputable hotels –  
how can a client know that a sports stadium knows how to organise a wedding?  
So, hotels do hold the professional advantage here – even if it is only the percep-  
tion of low risk which the client seeks. Hotels should exploit this advantage.  
Hotels have a habit of rebranding and reinventing. They could rebrand their event  
offering, too. Instead of looking at ‘The Royal Hotel’ for an event, the Royal Hotel  
could rebrand its events offering as ‘The Royal Venue’, ‘The Royal Events’, ‘The  
Royal for Events’, ‘Events at The Royal’, or simply ‘The Royal’. This would negate  
the stigma of clients resisting placing their event into a ‘hotel’, but would also  
allow The Royal to promote their events offering outside the hotel marketplace so  
that events organisers and clients find the hotel listed under ‘venues’. If a booker  
has not defined their search for a ‘hotel’, they will not come across The Royal as  
a potential venue. Hotels as venues for events 17  
First, though, hotel operators need to understand how event organisers search  
for venues, accept that they have lost the events foothold, and identify the need  
to rebrand their offering.  
In addition, hotels could increase the profile and awareness of what they offer as  
in-house services and facilities.  
It is common knowledge that hotels have restaurants and kitchens – so these  
facilities could be marketed to the events market as ‘event catering’ and ‘produc-  
tion kitchens’. The same principle could be applied to all in-situ technical appa-  
ratus – instead of ‘sound and light’, the language should appeal to tech managers  
\(‘faders’; ‘dimmers’\). This would enable production managers to recognise the  
capabilities of the hotel as a ‘venue’ and also signify that the hotel is experienced  
and proficient in hosting events with technical requirements.  
For many years, hotels have offered a ‘delegate rate’ for conferences. And, con-  
ferences are synonymous with hotels. This is why the delegate rate evolved\: con-  
ference organisers want to know how much it would cost for an all-­ inclusive  
package per person \(per delegate\). Hoteliers understand this demand. So, if a  
­ hotel is ­ offering arrival coffee and pastries, room hire, technical equipment in  
the room, mid-morning coffee and biscuits, buffet lunch, and afternoon tea and  
pastries, the rate for all these inclusions would be charged per delegate.  
But, hoteliers do not offer what could be called an ‘event guest rate’, where an  
event client could identify how much it would cost for an all-inclusive package per  
guest. This might include arrival drinks, canapes, room hire, production equip-  
ment in the room, dinner, a table drinks package \(or amount of wine per person\).  
Hotels could adapt and cater for this need – and pitch themselves as bona fide  
event venues to compete alongside the rival non-dedicated and unusual venues  
which have entered the marketplace. Chapter 4  
# Venue reputation  
It is important to recognise that because events have ‘leaked’ out of hotels and  
into all manner of other venues \(which may be non-dedicated or unusual\), and  
this appears to be the ongoing trend, there is greater risk of encountering a venue  
that is not familiar with handling events or has staff who are untrained or un-  
qualified in the standards and procedures related to events management.  
These shortfalls could be in the art of event management itself, or an incompe-  
tency in client management, the inability to meet deadlines, failing to provide  
resources as promised, substandard catering, non-understanding of crowd man-  
agement, or lacking knowledge of health and safety requirements for events.  
It is important, therefore, to establish not only whether a venue is unusual, but  
whether it has a team who are experienced or has the ability to host an event.  
Even if a venue does have a history of hosting events, it may be that the team have  
evolved their version of the art. In other words, they may manage events their  
way, because this is the only way they know.  
A specialist event organiser may easily identify the shortfalls of a venue, and should  
be in a position to lead the venue if that is the case. A client, however, may not re-  
alise that the splendid unusual venue of their choice is not proficient in managing Venue reputation 19  
events – particularly if the marketing blurb promotes themselves with a long list of  
hosting previous events that evokes the perception it is an ‘events venue’.  
Also to consider, are the additional risks associated with having to bring re-  
sources in to a non-dedicated or unusual venue. It is not unknown for suppliers to  
get the wrong day or deliver the wrong number of chairs. Transportation brings  
its own risks, too. There can be delays on roads, for example. These are not to be  
deemed high risks because they are infrequent, but it is risk nonetheless. Using a  
dedicated venue with all resources in situ, or using a hotel, negates these risks if  
everything is already there.  
It is true that unusual venues require more resources, which not only adds risk,  
but means more costs and thus a higher event budget. It has already been stated  
how hotels can be cheaper options for events because everything is already there.  
So, if using a warehouse for an event, the budget must extend to resources such as  
additional power, lighting, kitchens, temporary toilet facilities, exterior lighting,  
and myriad other cost implications.  
So, there are pros and cons for all types of venues. An event organiser can pick  
and choose according to the type of event, its location, size, number of attendees,  
whether overnight accommodation is required, the budget, and the complexity  
of the event. But, the real driver of where events are getting placed is the client.  
Demand dictates where the event takes place. And the demand of clients is mov-  
ing towards creative, innovative events that outshines their competitors – or even  
outshines their own previous event.  
Reputation is an unregulated industry’s way of self-regulation.  
What is getting better are the qualifications held by events managers now that  
universities offer courses in events management. The events courses themselves  
are a diversification from hospitality management. It could be that universities  
identified the diversification opportunity of a new genre of the hotel industry  
and designed courses to meet that opportunity. Or it may be argued that student  
demand led the way. The latter could be true if more people are being exposed to  
events such as weddings, fashion shows, concerts and festivals, where once upon  
a time events existed within hotels. This would follow the theory that events  
have evolved from hospitality and hotel management. It also supports the trend  
of events leaving hotels and so one does not need to be working in a hotel to  
come into contact with events and choose events management as a standalone  
and bona fide vocation.  
Whatever the reasons for events management courses to now exist, it is driving  
the events industry towards professionalism and thus self-regulation. This is ex-  
tremely helpful outside the traditional structural training of hotel managers. 20 The management of event venues  
It is becoming increasingly likely that any venue which hosts events will have  
an experienced and/or qualified events person. Or, an events specialist can be  
sourced by the client or the venue.  
Until such time when there is full self-regulation in the industry of events man-  
agement, the risk of unprofessionalism exists. For this reason, it is worthwhile to  
identify the reputation of a venue.  
4.1 History of a venue  
Possibly the easiest and most reliable identifier of the professionalism and ex-  
perience of a venue is their history of hosting events. This will determine their  
success of attracting event business, and perhaps their ability to retain repeat  
business. This is a pointer to reputation, but some venues are adept at winning  
business and that is where the adeptness ends.  
There are venues that are extremely busy with events but this alone turns them  
into event factories where they churn out event after event, after event. In this  
instance, a venue could be focusing on their sales and revenue more than the  
quality of the event experience they provide to event clients and event guests.  
Very busy wedding venues can be guilty of this practice, where they measure the  
success of their performance as a sales figure only.  
In cases where a venue is massively busy, there can be a tendency to evolve a cul-  
ture of complacency – the ‘it’s-another-wedding’ syndrome. Here, a bride may feel  
that she fits in after the last bride has left and before the next bride arrives. The  
routine of repeat events in such venues can make the event experience lacklustre  
and matter-of-fact. Unfortunately, this attitude will be endemic with all staff and  
management at the venue.  
So, a busy venue is not always testimony of the quality of events that they provide.  
4.2 Testimonials  
The past-client’s testimonial is a good way of testing a venue’s reputation.  
­ Unhappy clients do not write good reviews. A venue should be very willing to  
share reviews with prospect clients. So, if the venue is reticent to do so, it could  
suggest they do not have any.  
Venue managers should encourage satisfied clients to provide a testimonial, and  
if the client is happy it does not take much encouragement. Some venues, how-  
ever, move on to the next piece of business without thought of how the previous  
piece of business can act as a marketing tool for future business. It must become Venue reputation 21  
part of the operational procedures to ascertain client satisfaction and get it put  
in to writing.  
4.3 Client portfolio  
Looking at a venue’s client portfolio can determine the level of clients they at-  
tract. A lot of business into venues is through referrals, so it can be seen if clients  
are referring others to use a venue. The tell-tale signs of referrals is a range of  
clients in the same sector, or a range of events of the same type, because people  
doing business spread the word and it does not take long for word to get round  
not to use a venue.  
If one is looking to place a corporate event in to a venue, and that venue can  
demonstrate a range of corporate clients within their portfolio, this is a good  
indicator because corporate clients will be experienced in placing their events in  
to venues. A corporate client will avoid any risk of an event going wrong or not  
being enjoyed by guests, so if this venue is winning corporate event business, it  
can be seen as a good sign.  
Venue managers should work hard to obtain business from their target markets.  
Becoming a reputable venue in a market sector generates more business through  
word of mouth, and a good venue manager will recognise this. Savvy clients al-  
ready know this and will look at a venue’s client portfolio to ascertain its reputa-  
tion in that sector.  
4.4 Online reviews  
With the popularity of online reviews, feedback can be garnered from event  
guests as well as clients. Okay, not all reviews are accurate or fair, and one person  
may have a negative experience that could be against the norm or unjustified, but  
at a general level it is a good indicator of the reputation of a venue.  
With online reviews, it may be possible to get a broader measure of the venue –  
not just how they manage events, but also the quality of food, friendliness of the  
staff, how easy is it to find the venue, what the ambience is like, and what the  
sleep experience is like for overnight guests.  
A venue must protect its image and reputation because every client is a reviewer,  
these days. This hands power to the client because a venue is powerless to control  
online reviews, feedback and comments. It means venue managers must raise  
their standards and maintain them, and they must act upon any negative reviews  
and correct the cause of complaint. Otherwise, a string of negative reviews will  
become a pattern, and the pattern becomes its reputation. 22 The management of event venues  
4.5 By types of events  
Sometimes, it is worthwhile looking for venues that have experience of hosting  
the type of event one is looking to place. If looking for an unusual venue for a  
fashion show, has that venue hosted other fashion shows? If so, it would suggest  
it is a good venue for fashion shows and the venue team would have experience  
of hosting fashion events.  
However, some clients actively avoid venues that have been used for the type of  
event they are looking to place. A client may wish to be the first ever fashion show  
in that venue, and would avoid the venue if rival designers have already used it –  
clients do tend to avoid the risk of allowing comparisons to be made.  
A venue manager would be wise not to oversell previous events via their website  
or brochure – it can put clients off.  
4.6 Referrals by word of mouth  
By far the most reliable method of determining the reputation of a venue is by  
word of mouth. This is where networking within the events industry carries great  
value because industry-savvy professionals share information about people, ideas  
and places.  
Where a venue can be promoted favourably on its website and in its brochure,  
there is no control over what people say about its services. So, more valuable, per-  
haps, than hearing about venues with good reputation, word of mouth provides  
for the learning of venues with poor reputation.  
Once the good reputation of a venue is being built or has been built, the venue  
will naturally wish to share it with potential clients. This is not only pride, but  
good business practice.  
Business through word-of-mouth referrals is both the most effective and least  
expensive form of marketing.  
No venue will hide its good reputation. It will only hide its poor reputation. So, if  
there is no reputation whatsoever, it does not look good either way.  
Events is a close-knit industry and people do talk within it. Good venues will  
know this and are wise to the value of industry word of mouth. A professional  
venue will fiercely protect its reputation. This is helpful as it self-regulates in-  
dustry practice – for example, it is not good practice for a venue to poach clients  
from a specialist events organiser, because it will soon become known that this  
is a venue to avoid. Venue reputation 23  
4.7 View the venue – meet the team  
Whatever the reputation of the venue – even if it is known to have a good  
­ reputation – a venue must always be visited by the events organiser or client. For  
one thing, the venue could have had recent changes, such as a change of head chef  
or a new manager in place.  
One must not simply take another person’s word on a venue. It has to be seen  
and felt by the person making the decision and placing the booking. For one  
thing, it allows the venue a chance to make their impression. This is why it can  
be unfair to judge a venue on somebody else’s negative opinion. Maybe, that per-  
son had a bad experience which was nothing to do with the venue’s quality or  
professionalism.  
Personalities enter into the mix as well. Sometimes, one person will not get on  
with the team at the venue – but this is not to say it is not a good venue. Con-  
versely, it has been known to book a great venue, only to find that personalities  
clash and the relationship sours.  
So, in all cases, first-hand impressions are the most valid. At least the blame – if  
there is any – cannot be placed on to somebody else.  
Author’s voice box  
I tend not to recommend venues to other people.  
I feel it is up to the person looking for a venue to do their own research,  
like I did. I’m not being selfish, but it is a risk for me to recommend a  
venue that has since changed its management; or the personal dynam-  
ics of the person booking the venue does not gel with its staff and the  
experience turns sour. I try not to recommend things that are not within  
my control.  
So, whenever I do talk about a venue, I always make it clear that my  
opinion is only how I experienced the venue when I last used it. Chapter 5  
# Events as a source  
# of income  
5.1 Venues with events as the primary source of income  
If a building is constructed for the purpose of events \(dedicated venue\) it is reasona-  
ble to assume that its primary source of income will be from the business of events.  
But even venues that are not dedicated \(not built for the purpose of events\), such  
as country manor houses, castles, and those premises which have changed their  
use, such as a former fire station or former brewery, for example, may now con-  
sider events to be their main revenue stream and the primary source of income.  
Any venue which is now considering events to be their sole or primary income  
stream must have the facilities, manpower and expertise in-house to meet client  
and guest expectations and needs. The volume of events will be at a level which  
generates the primary income, so it follows that the venue will be well equipped  
and staffed to manage events.  
It could be that a venue does not host high volumes of events, but nevertheless  
is receiving primary revenue from events. In such cases, the venue manager will  
outsource the event expertise to event organisers or event management com-  
panies. Indeed, some venue owners may go so far as to unlock the doors and  
switch on the lights for viewings, but would have no expertise in the management  
of events and would rely on the client to be serviced by an event organiser or  
event management company. Events as a source of income 25  
So, it does not follow that a venue with events as their primary source of income is  
always a place which is competent in event management, client management, and  
guest management.  
It must be remembered that a musician or band’s success is often measured by  
their ability to sell-out stadium tours, which is a major step up from arena tours.  
In such instances, the sports stadium becomes a concert venue. But, the art of  
managing sports events is not the same art as managing a concert.  
In addition, it does not follow that because a purpose-built venue is called a con-  
ference centre, its sole ability is to host conferences. Most venues are flexible  
with their facilities and spaces so that they can diversify to host a range of types  
of events, thus widening their reach to a broader spectrum of events business.  
A common issue with venues diversifying their range of events is that the in-  
frastructure may be suitable for one type of event but not another. Kitchens, for  
example could be sited at one side of the venue making it difficult for a banquet  
to be served. This is the case at London’s O2 arena and it makes it logistically  
very difficult for servicing their large-scale dining events such as the BRIT  
Awards.  
The infrastructure of a venue may be good to go, and the management and staff  
may have abilities in security, venue management, staffing and crowd manage-  
ment. But, there are differences between opening a sports stadium for a football  
match and opening it for a rock concert. This is where the venue would dovetail  
their strengths with the strengths of a professional team in the type of event  
being placed into the venue.  
Venue managers must be cautious when receiving enquiries from events outside  
their usual remit, even if their venue can accommodate the booking. Overstretch-  
ing a field of expertise into another field, such as another type of event, can con-  
vert venue strengths into their weaknesses.  
Whatever the type of venue, and whatever the range of events it can accommodate, if  
it is a dedicated venue its primary source of income will be derived from events. But,  
the booker must understand where lies the field of expertise, nonetheless.  
5.2 Venues with events as their secondary source of  
income  
Not all venues consider events to be their core business.  
Many premises of all types, uses and sizes have realised the potential to gen-  
erate additional income through events. These would include lofts, unused  
buildings, disused warehouses, wharfs, manufacturing sites, car showrooms, 26 The management of event venues  
office headquarters, banks, government offices, art galleries, museums, shopping  
centres, parklands and open spaces, and any buildings considered to be of archi-  
tectural interest.

Thorpe Park in Surrey is a water-based theme park constructed around  
partially flooded gravel pits. It is a successful format which attracts  
1.8 million visitors each year.  
When I joined the company, events were viewed as a side attraction to  
facilitate the odd request for a company barbecue or a corporate fun  
day on the rides.  
As a young and eager employee, I realised the potential for achieving rev-  
enue from events and I grew the events from a splinter-section of another  
department into a standalone department that was positioned to market  
itself to the events industry and meet the needs of corporate clients.  
When the park’s directors saw an increase in contribution from events  
to the core business of the park’s rides, I was supported in providing  
more private spaces to accommodate larger numbers and more clients  
for a wider range of events from boat shows to craft fairs.  
Here was a landmark location with excellent facilities to attract corpo-  
rate clients, and a readymade infrastructure to support dining, partying,  
entertainment and even parking for attendees at large events.  
One of my clients wanted to rent the park for three evenings after it  
had closed to the general public. This required installation of lights for  
the first time in the park’s history. The success of these evenings and  
the fact that the lighting was in place led to ‘dark hours opening’ and  
eventually to the successful ‘Fright Nights’ concept.  
Additionally, my department operated over the winter months when the  
park was closed to the public. This achieved revenue from exhibitions,  
conferences, dinners, meetings and Christmas parties. Events was the  
only contributor of revenue during the park’s closed season when the  
income would otherwise have been zero.  
This demonstrates the impact events can have on the revenue of a busi-  
ness where events are not the core revenue provider. Events as a source of income 27  
Author’s voice box  
When I was on the management team of the inaugural Party in the Park  
event in 1998 for Prince Charles’s The Princes Trust, it was unheard of for  
permission to be granted for a closed event in Hyde Park – a designated  
royal park.  
One may argue that the Party in the Park open-air concert was an event  
for the public. But, the public needed to purchase tickets for admission,  
so it was not in the true spirit of an open royal park with a royal charter  
to be accessible to all.  
The amazing success of the event, the profile it raised for His Royal  
Highness’s charity and the funds it contributed to both the charity and  
the Royal Parks Department, enabled the event to reoccur the follow-  
ing year and each subsequent year, leading to the established Route of  
Kings annual concerts.  
This was proof that events contribute significant additional income out-  
side the core purpose of the venue – and it was proof with a royal seal  
of approval.  
All manner of buildings and premises have learnt how to generate sec-  
ondary income from events. Nowadays, almost every commercial build-  
ing in London – large and small – will consider hosting events, even if  
they have never done so before.  
Highclere Castle in Berkshire, UK, provides an example of a non-­ dedicated  
event venue that has achieved immense success from events, so that  
events contribute significant income to the core business.  
Highclere is a stately home and working farm. For many years, its main  
source of income was from ticket sales as a country house attraction with  
visitors paying for access to the magnificent home and fine grounds. It  
also hosted small and medium sized events, such as weddings, confer-  
ences and an annual jazz festival.  
I was once invited to Highclere Castle to provide ideas and advice on  
how to generate income from events and grow their existing portfolio.  
A short while afterwards, a television production company negotiated the  
use of Highclere as a set for filming a drama series called *Downton Abbey*.  
Now, Highclere Castle attracts more visitors than ever before! 28 The management of event venues  
Events extend the contribution of income for non-event venues.  
In the case of the Natural History Museum in London, the building has become  
as renowned for its events, as it is for its fine museum exhibits. Indeed, for many  
years London Fashion Week was held under marquees on the museum’s lawn.  
Events also occur in the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Science Museum, the  
British Museum and every museum in the land, because museums struggle with  
generating income and so they have diversified to become event venues.  
Because events are now seen to reap additional income, they are happening in  
premises that were previously inaccessible, such as governmental buildings, pri-  
vate clubs, disused Underground stations, and premises of the Royal Palaces.  
Even the law courts – the Royal Courts of Justice – can be booked for private  
events.  
Madame Tussauds is widely known as a successful events venue. Yet, even here  
the events are secondary to the core business of exhibiting waxworks of celebrities  
and notable figures in society. When the daytime paying visitors leave, ­ Madame  
Tussauds generates secondary income from hosting dinners, presentations and  
other celebrations in their galleries, with iconic figures from music, history and  
royalty looking over the shoulders of event guests as they dine. Chapter 6  
# Venue professionalism  
The drawback to the growth and diversity of event venues is that clients and their  
guests are more at risk of being exposed to venues which are unprofessional or  
inexperienced at managing events.  
In the traditional environment of events being staged in hotels and purpose-built  
dedicated venues, such as conference centres, the client may have justly felt that  
their event would be in safe hands. After all, most reputable hotels are experi-  
enced in the organisation of events. And, if a client were to book a conference cen-  
tre for their conference, it would be reasonable to assume that the venue would  
be experienced in running a conference.  
Certainly, dedicated venues seek to employ staff for the very business of events.  
These staff will be recruited for their experience, knowledge and qualifications –  
it would make sense to do so, and the labour expense would be justified. Whereas,  
the staff at a venue such as a museum, may not be as proficient \(nor interested\) in  
the good management of events.  
Sure, there are no guarantees that even a ‘traditional’ event venue will, in fact, be  
proficient in organising events – as with ‘bad’ hotels and ‘bad’ restaurants, ‘bad’  
venues do exist – let’s call them ‘wrong’ from here onwards.  
The difference between a good and ‘wrong’ hotel, restaurant or venue is a matter  
of the training and experience of the management and staff. 30 The management of event venues  
Training and experience determines professionalism.  
Hotels, restaurants and venues form the hospitality service industry and it is largely  
self-regulated or unregulated. Yes, it is regulated by legislation such as food hy-  
giene, health and safety, licensing laws, and employment regulations, but one  
does not require a qualification to be a hotelier or restaurateur – this is where  
the ‘wrong’ creeps in to the industry. Many hotels are wrongly run \(either from a  
business perspective or a customer experience perspective\) because the owner or  
manager is unqualified and inexperienced. Of course this differs from regulated  
sectors of society such as education or medicine.  
Events management is only an offshoot of hospitality management and in events  
there is no experience or qualification necessary to set up shop and perform the  
operation.  
It used to be that the ‘events industry’ was indefinable – tacked on to the hotel  
and catering industry, because events happened in hotels.  
People did not choose a career in events management, but fell into it by accident  
because they happened to be working in the conference and banqueting depart-  
ment of a hotel. Or, they had to organise a company occasion, like a conference  
or the office Christmas party, and this is how they became an ‘event manager’.  
Certainly, no events management courses existed and nobody really knew what  
‘event management’ was about.  
Lack of training in events management, plus inexperience of organising and run-  
ning events, is still the problem. But, all the time there is better and more avail-  
able training for people working in events. Events management has evolved in to  
a bona fide and recognised career choice.  
Events management has matured into a standalone career path.  
Other than good training for management and staff, and their experience of or-  
ganising quality events, the rise of internet reviews does keep hotels, restaurants  
and event venues in check. This is a good thing\: it is self-regulation. It will not  
be long before clients begin asking to see the qualifications of the staff in whom  
they entrust the management of their event. Already, clients are looking at how  
experienced is the venue and its staff.  
Wrong venues are not the norm anymore, which is possibly why they are more  
visible and easier to avoid. It is no longer so easy for a wrongly run venue to exist  
or sustain itself in the evolving industry of events.  
Also, everybody’s expectations of events are higher than ever before. Event cli-  
ents have increasingly higher demands not only for the creativity of the content of Venue professionalism 31  
their event, but for the service levels delivered by the venue. It is the clients who  
continue to extend the boundaries and drive the demand for better technology,  
standards and creativity.  
Guests have higher expectations, as well. They are attending ever-more-sophisticated  
events and expect their next event experience to exceed the pre-  
vious. For a guest, every event they attend is a learning curve which serves to  
educate them as to what is achievable. This is visible in the rise of ‘experiential’  
events which aim to deliver to the senses of those attending.  
The question is what determines a good venue from a wrong venue? And, because  
there is a vast spectrum of wrongness, how to identify just how wrong a venue is?  
Well, it is widely known what makes a good restaurant. Yes; it is the food.  
And, it is known that good cooking requires a trained an experienced chef.  
But, a restaurant customer’s satisfaction does not stop at what is served on  
the plate. A good restaurant is also determined and measured by its ambience,  
­ service, comfort and friendliness. In short, it is ‘the meal experience’ – the entire  
experience a customer receives from the moment they walk into the restaurant,  
to the moment they exit. Everything they experience between arrival and depar-  
ture is the ‘meal experience’.  
This philosophy can be attributed to event venues – we may call it ‘the guest ex-  
perience’. This is everything the event guest \(or the event client for that matter\)  
experiences from the moment they arrive at the venue to the moment they leave.  
Everything experienced between – the welcome; friendliness; service; cleanli-  
ness; attention to detail; attention to safety; proficiency of technical staff; the  
ambience; the look and feel; and the professionalism of the entire team – all these,  
separately and together, determine ‘the guest experience’.  
So, how does an event venue achieve a good guest experience? And, how can the  
event guest or event client know whether the experience is going to be good or wrong?  
It should be noted here that it is not only the reputation of a venue which is at  
stake with an event. The client’s reputation is exposed, too. Always, the client  
will be inviting guests, so their own choices and professionalism are on display.  
It can be extremely embarrassing – not to mention damaging – for a client to get  
a wrong venue. If it is a corporate client, their professional reputation – and even  
their job – could be at stake.  
The problem here is the time factor.  
With a restaurant the judgement of whether it is good or wrong can be instant.  
This is only because people know what indicators to look for. It comes upon 32 The management of event venues  
entering the restaurant – the beginning of the ‘meal experience’, remember – the  
cleanliness; friendliness; quick and efficient service. Then, the food is eaten and  
judged.  
With a hotel it is also a quick judgement. Again, it is cleanliness, friendliness and  
efficiency of service that is under scrutiny from the outset.  
However, with an event the results are not instant. The preparations \(the lead-in\)  
to the event can be three months or even much longer, during which time it is too  
late to judge the venue because it was booked, confirmed and a deposit paid at the  
outset. Loss of the deposit aside, it is also difficult to change a venue once a deci-  
sion has been made because the location would have been notified to attendees,  
suppliers, and other stakeholders. Often, it is the result of the event itself – the  
day of the event – which determines the right or wrongness of a venue, by which  
time the event is already happening.  
But, just as with restaurants and hotels, the tell-tale signs of a good or wrong  
venue are there at the beginning.  
If the client or booker thinks about what determines a good restaurant from the  
outset it will transfer to event venues as well\: reputation; look and feel; cleanli-  
ness; approach of the staff; a demonstration \(or feeling\) of professionalism; their  
experience; reviews…  
Thus, when choosing a venue for an event, the judgement of whether it is a good  
or wrong venue can be instant.  
Where these indicators are not visible – hotels and restaurants can be booked  
in advance \(over the phone, for example\) and so will an event venue – then it  
comes down to reputation\: word of mouth or online review sites before taking  
the plunge to go ahead and book. Here the event venue has an advantage over  
hotels and restaurants, because unlike walking into a restaurant or checking into  
a hotel, an event client will not book a venue without first having visited it. This  
safeguards the client \(if they know what indicators to look for\) and provides the  
opportunity for venue managers to ensure the pre-event visit \(the venue show-  
round\) goes extremely well.  
So, a venue show-round is not just a marketing opportunity for the venue to sell  
themselves to a client. Nor is it solely for the client to check out a venue. It is a  
two-way mirror to reveal the fit and spot the wrinkles.  
All the effort of an event venue manager amounts to one word\: reputation. Venue professionalism 33  
Author’s voice box  
At one venue I recently visited, I noticed how the large potted palms  
under the glass roof in the courtyard were in very poor condition\: they  
were thirsty, dusty and uncared-for.  
I was considering to recommend this venue to my client in which they  
may entertain their guests. So, I would rather have seen healthy and  
well-maintained plants. Or, I would prefer there were no plants whatso-  
ever, rather than a scattering of poorly kept specimens.  
This alone was not a serious issue. After all, I could remove the palms  
before the event began. I could replace them with healthy green plants,  
if I so desired.  
But, seeing the uncared-for plants did serve to forewarn me that a prob-  
lem with good management existed at that venue – at the very least it  
was poor housekeeping.  
The point is not to avoid an unprofessional venue, but to identify it.  
If I have identified that a venue is not professional, as in this case, I can  
manage those inadequacies. Not always will I walk away.  
It does mean I may have limited support from the venue – I might have  
to provide a cleaning crew under my control, for example. Even if the  
venue is friendly and willing, it is helpful to identify their shortfalls from  
the outset.  
Often, all I need is the four walls and a roof over our head, and the rest  
I will outsource from my own trusted and reliable providers if I have to.  
Once the indicators are known, the distinction between a good and a wrong  
venue becomes easier to identify.  
Long before any guests arrive, the event client \(which could be a private ­ client,  
corporate client, or a specialist event organiser\) will arrive to the venue to  
­ consider booking it for the event – this will happen at the earliest stage of the  
planning period \(the lead-in\).  
If the client is an event specialist and not the final decision maker, they will cer-  
tainly be recommending the venue to their client. So, whoever is the client, if the 34 The management of event venues  
venue should turn out to be wrong it is a serious negative reflection upon their  
judgement and experience.  
Here, it can be seen that another reputation can be added to the list – not only the  
venue’s reputation for hosting events, and that of the client for booking the venue,  
but also the reputation of the event specialist for recommending the venue.  
6.1 What makes a ‘good’ venue  
The first identification of a ‘good’ venue is in the detail. How well is it run?  
Ascertaining whether a venue is run well is not down to one element, but many  
factors which contribute to the whole and provide the experienced eye with a  
full-on wink of approval or disapproval.  
6.1.1 Cleanliness  
How clean a venue appears is always a good first indicator. Good cleaning is  
not a luxury, but a basic expectation. As has been already identified, an unclean  
hotel room or a dirty restaurant is easy to recognise as unacceptable. It is the  
same principle with an event venue, once cleanliness is recognised as being a key  
indicator.  
An unclean venue is not only indicative of bad management in allowing clients  
and guests to have an event in a dirty or unhygienic environment, but is bad  
behaviour, too.  
If a venue cannot manage an effective cleaning regime, it is a reflection of their  
poor and ineffective standards of management throughout.  
Venue managers must not underestimate the importance of good housekeeping.  
Every client or potential booker has the ability to identify clean from dirty. The  
easy part is that there is no in-between measure\: if it is not clean, it is dirty.  
Displaying poor housekeeping means that the venue manager does not care; or  
is not interested in details; or is lacking pride, energy, effort or commitment.  
Whichever it is, is not important because the first indicator \(poor cleaning\) sig-  
nals the problem, not the symptoms.  
A good client will not stick around long enough to understand why a venue  
is dirty, and may not even indicate this is why they are rejecting the venue.  
­ Clients tend not to offend and will decline politely. Besides, if a client is not Venue professionalism 35  
going to book the venue, why should they bother to describe the reason? So,  
a venue manager may not know why potential clients are choosing competitor  
venues.  
The glaring issue with poor housekeeping is that the causes will carry throughout  
the management of the venue. If a venue manager is not taking care of details,  
this will be the same with all other details. If it is down to poor leadership, the  
staffing team at the venue will likely also be poorly led in the kitchen, the bar, re-  
ception, and most everywhere else. This is why cleanliness is such an important  
and obvious first indicator.  
6.1.2 Appearance  
If a venue appears tired and tatty, then so may its attitude towards event clients.  
If the management are struggling with the upkeep of the venue, it suggests either  
a lack of interest or a lack of the level of business. The management’s priority may  
be purely financial gain or financial austerity – they are not reinvesting in their  
offering, which could affect the quality of service and the support they provide  
to event clients.  
6.1.3 Enquiry handling  
Often, the way a venue handles an enquiry sets the precedent for further commu-  
nication and approach procedures.  
Enquiries are the first client-to-venue contact. If the enquiry handling procedure  
is unprofessional, unhelpful or unwilling, it suggests this is the way the manage-  
ment process will follow at that venue.  
6.1.4 Response  
After the enquiry, a good indicator of a venue’s strengths and weaknesses will  
be in their response to the enquiry or subsequent questions that the client needs  
satisfied.  
Responses can be measured by the venue’s willingness to provide answers, how  
long it takes to respond and whether their experience of events enables them to  
adequately answer the client’s questions.  
6.1.5 Procedures  
It usually becomes apparent early on whether a venue has effective procedures  
for handling enquiries, bookings, show-rounds and confirmations. If any part of 36 The management of event venues  
this procedural process gets passed around the management team, it suggests an  
ineffective management structure exists \(see 9.0 for a detailed explanation of the  
venue management structure\).  
Each of the indicators stated above enables the client or organiser to ‘instantly’  
judge an event venue, just as if they were checking into a hotel or being seated  
at a table in a restaurant. It is important, therefore, for the venue manager to  
view each indicator and measure how a prospective client would view their  
venue.  
A venue manager must understand the factors by which clients reach the deci-  
sion to book or reject a venue for their event. However, it is not enough to know  
them – most venue managers would know the factors if they were asked – so it is  
important to recognise them and measure them from the perspective of a client  
visiting their venue for the first time.  
A professional venue will have made sure to build its good reputation. It is the  
mainstay of a venue’s business to do so.  
Referring again to London’s Natural History Museum as an example, it is a hugely  
successful venue with sustainable events business due largely by maintaining its  
reputation as a magnificent venue to hold events.  
When a client or event organiser books a venue, they want to feel assured that  
their event is being held at a reputable and experienced venue, just by the volume  
of business it satisfies. Peace of mind\: what more could a client ask when choos-  
ing a venue for their event?  
There are three tools to avoid when ascertaining a venue’s reputation.  
1 It is not a good idea to garner opinions from local competitors. Opinions  
from competing venues cannot be taken as genuine or unbiased.  
2 Do not rely on the venue’s own marketing \(website or brochure\). A good web  
designer or graphic designer will make the venue look attractive – it does not  
mean the venue knows how to organise events.  
In addition, the client list on a venue’s website or in their brochure could be  
historic – perhaps under previous ownership or management. Venues last  
longer than people.  
3 The venue’s staff, management and sales personnel may not lie about the  
professionalism and experience of the venue at which they are employed, but  
their opinions certainly cannot be taken as unbiased. Venue professionalism 37  
Author’s voice box  
When I was the head of events at a well-known central London venue,  
potential clients would visit for a show-round and did often ask about  
my nearest competitor.  
This was never awkward for me. After all, I knew my competitor existed  
along the road and it was fair and right for clients who were searching  
for somewhere to hold their event, to visit other venues in the vicinity.  
So, I never would provide negative comments. I would simply suggest  
that they visit my competitor themselves and make up their own mind.  
Besides, I was very aware of my competitor’s weaknesses and I was con-  
fident that if a client visited them, they would sniff them out.  
This nearest competitor, however, would always give potential clients a  
negative opinion about my venue.  
I don’t know how many clients \(if any\) were put off my venue by my com-  
petitor’s underhand tactic. But, I do know how many clients told me they  
considered my competitor to be unprofessional because of how they de-  
rided my venue. I feel confident the latter is far greater than the former.  
It must be remembered that the venue must satisfy the event organiser, the cli-  
ent and the guests. It can be identified, then, that there are four distinct parties  
involved with any event\:  
1 The venue event manager – the person running the venue, or running the  
event on behalf of the venue.  
2 The event organiser – this person may be the client, or could be an events  
specialist or events company hired by the client.  
3 The client – the person paying the bill for the event.  
This person could be a private client, such as for a wedding, birthday party or  
anniversary party; or a direct client, such as a club promoter or quiz organ-  
iser, or a corporate client on behalf of an organisation.  
A venue should note that the client may also be the event organiser, such as  
an event specialist or agency hired to manage the event, or may not be the  
organiser and would either expect the venue to organise the event, or would  
engage the services of a specialist event organiser or agency.  
4 The guest who attends the event. 38 The management of event venues  
In addition to these four interested parties, there are other stakeholders who  
would have an interest in the choice and capability of the venue\:  
5 Sponsors – think of where their product will be exposed.  
6 Press – think of camera angles, press rooms, interview rooms, ease of access  
to the location.  
7 Caterers and other service providers, such as furniture hire companies and  
decorators – think of the style of venue, its location, access and delivery  
points.  
8 Entertainers, such as bands, speakers, presenters.  
9 Technical, such as crew and management – think of the acoustics, ceiling  
height, visibility.  
10 Security – think of VIP areas, exits that require security, car drop-off points.  
11 Legal, licensing and permission providers, such as police, medics, fire, local  
authorities, risk assessors, environmental health.  
12 Local residents who may be affected by volume of visitors, increased traffic,  
noise disturbance.  
6.2 Venue show-round  
A venue show-round \(or venue recce – short for reconnaissance\) is where a client  
or event organiser visits a potential venue for their event and receives a show-  
round of the facilities and spaces by the event manager or venue manager.  
It is extremely rare for a booking to confirm without the client first viewing the  
venue. Of course, if the client has used the venue before, the booking may go  
ahead without a show-round.  
Event organisers and event companies will bring their client to view venues they  
have identified as being suitable for the event. This could be just one venue – the  
best they have identified as a fit for the event – or it could be two or three venues  
to view and the organiser will make the decision with the client after viewing  
these venues.  
Often, organisers will visit venues in advance of bringing a client to view. This is the  
preferred way because the organiser can liaise with the venue, negotiate rates, get  
the logistics planned, and establish a relationship with the venue manager before the  
client is present. In such cases the organiser’s show-round can be made in advance of  
the client’s visit, or it could take place on the same day but before the client arrives. Venue professionalism 39  
Viewing in advance of the client also allows the organiser to plan their route to  
the venue and make sure they know how to gain access and who to deal with. It  
is professional to have visited the venue in advance and demonstrate to the client  
that the organiser is familiar with the venue manager.  
Some organisers, however, will visit a venue for the first time with their client.  
This can be because of limitations with time or the location, or where the organ-  
iser has a familiar relationship with their client and can be open with the venue  
in front of the client.  
From the venue’s point of view, a venue show-round is an event and should be  
treated as such.  
This means the approach to show-rounds requires procedures, preparation and  
planning.  
A venue manager should first understand the indicator factors identified in sec-  
tion 6.1 of this book and how they influence the decisions of potential clients  
viewing the venue.  
It is also imperative to present the venue in a professional manager and have pro-  
cedures in place to do so. These would include the following.  
• Ensuring the venue is clean from previous events or other activities.  
• Ensuring the venue is accessible and that no other events are taking place  
where areas and spaces are not available to view.  
• Ensuring the entire staff are aware of a client being in the venue for a  
show-round.  
• Setting the venue in the correct mode for the type of enquiry. So, if the client  
is viewing for a fashion show, the venue should be set for a show; if the event  
is to be a party, the venue should be set for a party. This may include sound,  
lighting, projection, furniture layout.  
• Providing hospitality such as coffee on arrival, chilled water, lunch.  
• Providing a quiet place to discuss the event.  
Venues exist in a competitive marketplace and with more event clients seeking  
unusual and creative venues, the competition is ever-increasing. It is usual for a  
client to identify two or three venues or locations and visit each before making a  
decision to book. 40 The management of event venues  
The show-round is the venue’s sales opportunity and a chance to promote its  
professionalism. This is difficult to achieve if the show-round does not go well. To  
ensure it does go well requires planning to lessen any risk of a show-round failing.  
The show-round not only provides a first impression, it may provide the  
only impression.  
So, a venue manager must take each show-round event seriously and not treat it  
merely as a ‘prospect’ or a ‘chance’ of a booking. In fact, a show-round is the op-  
portunity to secure the booking. After all, if the client or organiser has scheduled  
a show-round, they have already identified the venue as being suitable for their  
event.  
Clients will quickly identify a laisse-faire attitude as easily as they can identify  
if the venue is clean or dirty\: it is easy to spot. This will drive them to choose a  
competitor venue.  
Also, clients will be driven away by a clear ‘salesy’ venue manager who will prom-  
ise everything just to get the booking. Clients like to make their choice and not  
be pushed into it by sales patter. Remember; the show-round is an opportunity to  
demonstrate professionalism, not ‘sell’ the venue.  
Mostly, clients appreciate honesty. It is not honest for a venue manager to run  
down a competitor’s venue. And, if the venue is not a fit for one reason or an-  
other, the venue manager should be honest and let the booking go elsewhere. It is  
a too common mistake for a venue to grab whatever business comes its way and  
not be able to execute a successful event. It is better to have no booking than a  
wrong booking. Chapter 7  
# The need to  
# meet expectations  
It should be kept in mind that there are four distinct parties involved with venues  
and events.  
1  
The venue event manager \(employed by the venue\).  
2 The event organiser \(specialist event organiser or event company\).  
3 The client \(who may or may not be the event organiser\).  
4 The guest who attends the event.  
The exodus from traditional venues has fuelled the need for event organisers to  
impress their guests. Event creativity, decoration, entertainment and the entire  
‘guest experience’ \(what is now termed as experiential events\) each play their im-  
portant role in satisfying or exceeding guests’ expectations – or failing them.  
The venue is a key element of reaching guests’ expectations at an event.  
An exciting environment is the linchpin of whether the event will be successful.  
It has not always been this way. At one time, event organisers would have chosen  
a venue for its functionality and practicality. If the venue was in a good enough  
location and could accommodate the basic requirements of the event, it would be  
chosen. Once, that was all it took to satisfy the client and the guests. 42 The management of event venues  
Nowadays, functionality and practicality do not reach far enough. Clients want  
something more. Their guests expect it. This demands that the venue must meet  
or surpass all expectations.  
The evolvement of the events industry has taken events business out of hotels  
and into the cold harsh world of ‘unsafe’ venues where professionalism and ex-  
pertise is not assured.  
Anybody in the position of booking a venue can no longer leave it to chance and  
hope that they can rely on the venue to make everything go smoothly.  
Anybody in the position of recommending venues to clients – normally specialist  
event organisers – has their reputation and future business to consider and must  
therefore be able to distinguish good venues from wrong venues. Most organisers  
build a portfolio of known and trusted venues.  
Anybody in the position of visiting a venue as a guest should at least possess an  
understanding of what to expect from the venue and what to do if their expecta-  
tions are not met.  
Venues themselves are in the position to meet the expectations of all those men-  
tioned above.  
If the above parties were to pool their knowledge – the venue managers, venue  
bookers, event clients, event organisers and event guests – then the evolvement of  
the events industry would be successful for everybody in it... which is everybody.  
Venue managers must keep up with the changing demands and expectations of  
their private clients, corporate clients, their specialist event-organiser clients, and  
the guests who attend their venue. Otherwise, their venue will fall behind their  
competitors.  
The explosion of events into non-traditional venues provides opportunity for all  
sorts of premises, companies and private landowners to earn income from hiring  
out their facilities for events. This is why more people need to be provided with  
the skills to meet the demands and expectations of event clients and their guests.

# Venue culture change  
There are venues which are obliged to host events even if they do not really wish  
to. It is as if they are forced into hosting events simply because there is a demand  
for them to do so.  
Demand could be a one-off enquiry for using the premises for an event, or it could  
be repetitive because the venue has some attraction, such as interesting architec-  
ture or is at a prominent location. Such venues – and their staff – can consider  
events as an interruption to the core business.  
For example, a museum with interesting architecture might be hosting an  
evening canapé reception and the museum staff may feel inconvenienced that  
they must stay late to work at the event. Door staff will be required to stay  
longer; the cloakroom must be manned until the last guest leaves; cleaning staff  
face an additional workload on the morning after the event... Everybody’s day  
is lengthened and their daily work routine is interrupted. For staff who have a  
usual work pattern, it is most disruptive to stay late at work – they may have  
to make arrangements for their children to be met from school; or they will  
miss their usual bus or train home from work; they will arrive home late, so  
their evening routine is disrupted. Staff do not always welcome changes to their  
routine workday. 44 The management of event venues  
Sure, overtime payments are always welcome, but this may not be perceived as  
worth the late hours and out-of-hours inconvenience.  
An employee’s resentment at having to work an event is understandable – especially  
if, as a museum employee, say, they did not choose events as a career option.  
Unfortunately, any negative elements will reflect poorly on the result\: the event.  
It is essential, therefore, for any venue which finds itself in the position of hosting  
an event, to do so professionally and ensure the staff are carried along with the idea.  
Doing it right is not a choice.  
As any business adviser will confirm, resistance to change is due to poor  
communication.  
If the management approach is right, staff at the museum will be shown to realise  
how an event can contribute significantly to the success of the organisation which  
employs them. This means secure jobs.  
But, staff will not always recognise this unless it is communicated to them or  
they see the impact on their wage slip. Even then, what arrives in their pay packet  
must be worthwhile for the inconvenience of working at the event or taking on an  
additional workload because of it.  
It is important that staff who are carrying the success of the event and the success  
of the business are included in a share of these successes.  
Staff are the frontline of any venue and can make the event special for both the  
client and the guests. Understanding this basic correlation is crucial if a venue is  
going to win business, retain business, and build and maintain its good reputation.  
8.1 The need for good communication  
The key to good venue management is good interdepartmental communication.  
The situation which most often arises at non-dedicated venues is that the staff  
simply do not understand the business of events. To them, an impending event is  
the cause of inconvenience and disruption, as outlined above.  
A barman, cleaner or security attendant may be adept at their job, but they may  
not appreciate the complexities of organising an event, meeting corporate expec-  
tations and satisfying a client. Venue culture change 45  
Staff may not understand that the needs and expectations of a corporate client  
and their guests are going to be different to satisfying the person who normally  
patronises the core business – a library visitor, perhaps.  
Crucially, the staff may not even care about these differences, let alone identify  
them or begin to try to understand them.  
Helping staff to care about events is the role of the venue manager, even if the  
venue is not an event venue, but a library.  
Culture change within the organisation is necessary – and it is very possible to  
achieve.  
Author’s voice box  
In my role as the head of events at various non-dedicated venues, I have  
consistently proved that as the culture shifts within the organisation or  
venue, staff will actively seek to participate with events.  
At one venue where staff members resented events because of the change  
to their daily work pattern, their participation in successful events soon  
resulted in them looking forward to the next event that would insert va-  
riety into their otherwise mundane work routine.  
Quite quickly, I was getting hounded by staff who wanted the next event  
to happen. In turn, this put pressure on me to increase the level of events.  
What an excellent sales incentive that was!  
The primary objective is inclusion.  
When staff become included in the process of organising an event, they will begin  
to feel responsible for their part in making that event a success. Inclusion begins  
with communication.  
The suggestion here is not to include staff with the management of the event,  
but in the communication procedures of the event. In other words, they have  
their job to do, but they can do it within the context of understanding the event  
manager’s role. 46 The management of event venues  
8.1.1 Here is a case study example – the zoo  
The staff at the zoo do not respond well to a corporate client wanting to have  
a buffet lunch served out in the garden by the waterfall, whereas all other zoo  
visitors are happy to eat in the restaurants or designated picnic areas. The incon-  
veniences of this request are that the garden has to be closed to the public, tables  
and chairs need to be set up in the garden, the restaurant staff have to serve food  
out there in addition to serving zoo visitors in the restaurant, the garden has to  
be cleared after the corporate clients have eaten, and finally the area will require  
cleaning before it can be reopened to the public. For the zoo staff whom have to  
do all this, the logistics of this request may not seem worth the effort.  
But, if the zoo venue manager were to communicate that the event is worth  
£12,000 income, that the client is entertaining international investors to the city  
where the zoo is located, that the client wants a private area for their guests and  
they like the view from where the fountain garden is, that there is real potential  
for ongoing repeat bookings from this client, that the client had been looking at  
an alternative venue but decided to book our zoo... If all this valuable information  
gets communicated to the staff, they would not have a problem with the minor  
inconveniences of a lunch served by the fountain in the garden.  
Indeed, the staff may enjoy the experience of serving food by the fountain in the  
sunshine for a change, rather than in the restaurant as they do every other day.  
It can be that the zoo staff will be asking if they can do this again, and when is  
the next booking like this going to happen.  
If dining in the garden becomes a regular request, staff will adapt to the need  
and will miss it when it does not happen. And, it all happened because the staff  
understood who the client is, what they want, why they want it, and its value to  
the business that pays their wages.  
Variances in routine can identify new working practices, so they should at least be  
investigated. If, in the zoo example, the ambience and logistics of serving lunch in  
the fountain garden proved successful, it may be that this would become a venue  
for group lunches for zoo visitors as well as event guests.  
8.2 interdepartmental communication  
Where there are departmental divisions at a venue, effective interdepartmental  
communication is the only way the venue can operate good events.  
The word ‘only’ is used with purpose. Events are a team effort because they re-  
quire many elements to be drawn together to achieve the goal of success. These Venue culture change 47  
elements must be provided by a range of staff and specialists, without whom the  
event will not work.  
Considering that the venue is the key element to the success of an event and that  
elements for the event will be drawn from various departments – kitchen, bar,  
reception, bedrooms – clearly, the events department cannot facilitate the event  
alone.  
Therefore, it is impossible for an event to succeed if the departments are not  
working together. And, the only way of working together is through effective  
communication.  
Venues and hotels are departmental environments. The nature of departmen-  
talisation means that departments tend to work autonomously within their own  
parameters. The staff can develop their own micro-environment and in some  
cases they do not interact with other departments within the same venue or  
organisation. This is a frequent factor in hotels where one department fails to  
interrelate with another.  
Much research and writing has been done on this subject and educated hoteliers  
know to encourage cross-departmental relations.  
Informal communication and team-work techniques such as staff social events  
are implemented not just for fun, but to get departments interacting with each  
other. ‘Nudging’ staff members to interact through social activities helps peo-  
ple get along. They begin to understand each other, appreciate their individual-  
ism and identify like-minded colleagues outside the physical barriers of working  
within departments.  
Structured methods of communication need to be introduced, too. These can  
include daily operations meetings for all departments to discuss business of the  
current day; heads of department meetings to share department information with  
other departments; and events meetings to specifically communicate details of  
forthcoming events to the departments which will be affected. Often, the heads  
of department meeting will allow for discussing forthcoming events.  
8.2.1 Event forecast \(example in Appendix I\)  
The event forecast is a list of forthcoming events.  
It will contain less detail than a function sheet \(see 8.2.2\) as its purpose is to  
provide basic information to other departments which need advance warning to  
arrange logistics such as staffing levels, or ordering items such as food products  
which may have lag times due to ordering and delivery processes. 48 The management of event venues  
Typically, an event forecast will show information such as the date of the event,  
its location in the venue such as which room\(s\), other requirements such as bed-  
rooms, the type of event, and the number of guests attending.  
Depending on the venue, an event forecast can show forthcoming events for a ten  
day period, fortnightly period or monthly period.  
8.2.2 Function sheet \(see Appendix III\)  
The function sheet is a detailed information document and is produced for each  
event. It provides an activity timeline for the lead-in to the event, the day of the  
event, and any activities required to carry out post-event.  
A function sheet is built organically during the preparation period \(lead-in\) of the  
event. As details and logistics become known, so they are added to the function  
sheet and this document takes shape. Building it this way avoids forgetting to  
include something that should be on the function sheet, and it helps to see how  
the event is taking shape as elements get drawn together and set in place on the  
running order.  
The running order forms part of the function sheet and is a list of activities that  
are due to take place, when they should take place, and who is responsible for  
them taking place.  
At some point close to the date of the event, everything will be in place and so  
there is nothing more to add and the function sheet is complete. At this point, the  
function sheet can be distributed to key stakeholders \(see below\). The completion  
point will vary from event to event due to variations in event size, nature and  
complexity, but it will be close enough to the event so that there are no changes  
to the schedule, yet with time to allow for key stakeholders to review it and raise  
any issues.  
Where a function sheet has been distributed and there are changes to be made  
because some element of the event has changed or is now included at a late  
stage, or because a key stakeholder has identified an issue, a second edition  
will be published and distributed. Some venues prefer to issue a ‘draft’ function  
sheet for these reasons and will thereafter distribute the ‘final’ function sheet.  
The function sheet becomes the guide sheet for all parties working the event.  
Every detail is contained within this document and nothing must happen at the  
event if it is not on the function sheet.  
List of key stakeholders for distributing the function sheet\: Venue culture change 49  
• Event organiser/venue manager.  
• Technical or production manager.  
• All departments at the venue – usually distributed to the head of each department.  
• Client \(running order only\).  
• Caterer or kitchen.  
• Suppliers \(running order only\).  
• Sponsors \(running order only\).  
On the day of the event, the function sheet is used to brief the staff and copies  
of the running order only can be placed in departments such as the bar and the  
kitchen for staff to refer if they have any doubts or receive queries from guests.  
8.2.3 Briefing meetings  
The event organiser will brief members of the team at various key stages. The  
first stage will be at a departmental level – the heads of department meeting. This  
would outline the forthcoming event, and information may be limited so could be  
taken from the event forecast \(see 8.2.1\).  
The next opportunity to brief other parties would be at the operations meeting  
on the day of the event.  
After this, there would be an event briefing for staff working the event. This brief-  
ing meeting would be scheduled on to the function sheet \(see 8.2.2\) to take place  
30 minutes before the doors open to guests. This close timing allows for most  
of the set-up to have taken place and staff should be free to attend a ten-minute  
briefing. Nothing is going to change at this late stage. After the briefing meeting,  
staff can return to complete final touches to their area before the doors open and  
guests enter the venue.  
Where there is opportunity to do so, a pre-event briefing can be scheduled. This  
would take place before the day of the event. Pre-event briefings are usually for  
key members of the event team who will be busy and unavailable to attend the  
staff briefing on the event day. Besides, the staff briefing is for operational details,  
whereas a pre-event briefing is at managerial level.  
Also, it would be impractical to call staff in for a briefing before the day of the  
event because some staff will be working just for the event – bar and waiting staff,  
for example. It would cost to bring staff in for a pre-event briefing, so this is why  
the staff briefing happens on the day. 50 The management of event venues  
Sometimes, however, it is necessary to bring staff in for a pre-event briefing – if  
it is a large event with a lot of staff and it would not be viable to brief them all on  
the day of the event. This is often the case with challenge events, such as run-  
ning events and bike ride events, where large numbers of volunteers are used to  
marshal the route. Logistically, it would be better to call all staff in for an hour’s  
briefing before the day of the event.  
Of course, there would be no cost for requiring volunteers to attend a pre-event  
briefing.  
In the ‘zoo garden’ case study example, it is easy to identify what the event organ-  
iser needs to communicate to the staff.  
Value of the event  
Informing the staff that the event was worth £12,000 income would demonstrate  
the importance of this client to the company and how much the client has outlaid  
for the experience of having lunch served at the fountain in the garden. This also  
makes the effort worthwhile.  
In the zoo example, where core business zoo visitors pay individual ticket prices,  
the value of a corporate booking will seem very impressive to the staff.  
The client  
If the zoo staff are made aware of who the client is and what the event is for – in  
this case it was to entertain international investors – they will have an under-  
standing and appreciation of the event. This is important because they will be  
front-line service staff to the client and the client’s guests.  
Information such as this will help with staff engagement and support. Besides,  
why should they not know all about this event and the client they will be serving?  
Why the garden?  
When the staff are briefed that the client has requested a private area for their guests  
to enjoy lunch so that they can meet up, network and socialise with each other, and  
that the garden has been chosen because of the splendid view, the staff will appre-  
ciate the rationale of this request and it is no longer just ‘an inconvenience’.  
Potential repeat business  
It would raise the importance of the event if the staff were aware that this corpo-  
rate client could bring more business into the zoo. It may also raise the level of  
service standards, too. Venue culture change 51  
The client chose the zoo  
It would be worthwhile to explain to staff that the client did not have to choose  
the zoo for their event. The staff will understand that other venues exist and the  
client could easily have had lunch elsewhere. But, the event manager successfully  
sold the event at the zoo and the client did choose it\: they made a choice and  
chose to come to the zoo. This should inject a level of pride among the zoo staff.  
In addition, it is important to convey to staff that are not in the business of  
event management, just how complex it is to satisfy a corporate client so that  
they can appreciate the behind-the-scenes planning that has gone into this event  
happening.  
If the events department exists in isolation without communicating to other de-  
partments the complexity and intricacies of clients’ needs and expectations, and  
the effort it takes to deliver those needs and expectations, there will be a failure  
in the understanding and co-operation of other staff.  
A corporate client would have needs, expectations and required levels of stand-  
ards that the daily visitors would not possess. The event booking process would  
be lengthy\: the enquiry; the show-round; the confirmation; the lead-in... It is  
essential that other staff are aware of these complexities. Otherwise, they simply  
will not know about it and never appreciate how the events department go about  
securing bookings and looking after clients.  
*8.2.3.1 Client briefing*  
It can be advantageous to meet with the client for a final briefing just before  
the event occurs. This can be as near as a day or two before the event day. Or, it  
can be on the date of the event and before the time of the rehearsal is reached.  
Often, the client will want to watch or take part in the rehearsal, so if arrange-  
ments are made for the client to arrive earlier, the client briefing can take place  
pre-rehearsal.  
The purpose of the client briefing is to finalise last minute arrangements, such  
as guest lists and VIP arrivals. Or, to ensure that any last-minute changes to the  
event schedule have been communicated. However, the main objective is to re-  
ceive client approval at this late stage when every element is in place so as to  
­ mitigate problems or unmet expectations after the event. If the client briefing  
takes place, it is difficult for a client to complain about something post-event.  
*8.2.3.2 Sponsor briefing*  
Where sponsors are supporting an event, it is advisable to hold a sponsor brief-  
ing. This can be before the day of the event, if possible. However, if the sponsors 52 The management of event venues  
are many, are not available, or distance makes it difficult to meet pre-event, it  
makes sense to conduct the sponsor briefing onsite on the day of the event.  
If the sponsor is to make a speech or present an award, they will need to rehearse.  
It makes sense, therefore, to conduct sponsor briefings on the day of the event,  
pre-rehearsal.  
The purpose of the sponsor briefing is to ensure all sponsors are aware of their  
responsibilities and limitations. This is important especially where product sam-  
pling is concerned, so as to prevent conflicts, territory arguments and aggressive  
selling techniques.  
Also, sponsors may have responsibilities, such as hosting a table or a pre-event  
reception, so it is helpful to brief them on these responsibilities. However, the  
main objective is to receive sponsor approval at this late stage when every ele-  
ment is in place, so as to mitigate problems or unmet expectations after the event.  
If the sponsor briefing takes place, it is difficult for a sponsor to complain about  
something post-event.  
8.3 The communication process for venues  
In most venues there will be a member of staff delegated with the responsibility  
for facilitating event clients. This would be the head of events, events manager,  
events co-ordinator, or events planner.  
Even in venues that do not have this position in place because they do not often  
host events and it would not be viable to employ a member staff with the sole  
responsibility of managing events, somebody would assume the role for the oc-  
casion. This might be the venue manager, sales manager, or marketing manager.  
The difference here is that in the latter case, the venue manager, sales manager,  
or marketing manager may not have experience of organising events.  
Whatever the case, the staff member at the venue who is responsible for the event  
being organised, now has the responsibility to coordinate all the resources for  
the event.  
One of these responsibilities is communication.  
8.3.1 Heads of department \(HOD\) meetings  
Most corporations, organisations, hotels and venues will be familiar with the  
procedure of conducting weekly heads of department meetings. At this meeting, Venue culture change 53  
the most senior attendee \(usually the general manager or deputy manager\) will  
ask each HOD to report on their department.  
For the events department, their report will include communicating imminent  
events happening at the venue. ‘Imminent’ relates to events happening between  
this and the next HOD meeting.  
It is important to remember that events represent a standalone income stream  
and should be treated as a department in its own right. Even if there is not an  
events department, but the event is being handled by marketing or sales, an event  
must never be treated as merely an ‘add-on’.  
The HOD meeting must have time allocated for the reporting of forthcoming  
events because this is a vital channel of communication to all other departments.  
Therefore, the HOD agenda must show events as a standalone department \(even  
where it is not\).  
At the weekly HOD meeting, the person responsible for events must commu-  
nicate the level of event enquiries, who they are from and what is their current  
status.  
For example\:  
• There were six event enquiries received last week\:  
Four were from local firms  
One was from Coca-Cola, London  
One was from the record label representing Elton John  
• There are 13 confirmed events in the bookings diary, three of which occur in  
the forthcoming week.  
• The three events this week … \[here there will be a run-through of the func-  
tion sheet \(see 8.2.2\) for each event\]  
First, it is important to report the level of enquiries, which are of interest in the  
HOD meeting due to the potential financial contribution to the core business,  
which is a performance measurement and should be reported.  
It should be that the HODs witness the growth of enquiries over time. It will not  
take long before the HODs begin rating the performance of the events depart-  
ment by the increase or decrease of event enquiries. 54 The management of event venues  
Second, the HODs will be interested to learn that there is a possible event with an  
international blue-chip organisation, such as Coca-Cola, and will assume it is a  
healthy budget. This level of communicative interaction allows other departments  
to take interest and show enthusiasm in the business of the events department.  
Third, if there is an exciting or high-profile event enquiry, such as the record  
label representing Elton John, the HODs will look forward to the possibility of  
this enquiry converting to a confirmation. They will show interest, ask about its  
progress from enquiry to confirmation, and will already be won over before the  
event takes place.  
In the case of the 13 confirmed events in the bookings diary, the events manager  
should issue a weekly update – the event forecast \(see 8.2.1\).  
With the three confirmed events happening in the forthcoming week, the events  
manager will provide more details and run through each function sheet \(see  
8.2.2\).  
This level of detailed information will allow the HODs to reassess the forthcom-  
ing week’s staffing levels, which areas are being used \(or closed\) to facilitate  
events, and to make special preparations according to the specific needs of each  
event. This also becomes the forum for HODs to ask questions relating to each  
event.  
One cannot expect distanced staff and managers to become engaged or enthusi-  
astic about events in their venue if they do not know about them \(and how diffi-  
cult it is to meet the client’s expectations\). Chapter 9  
# The Berners one-person  
# management structure  
For a venue to effectively co-ordinate \(and communicate\) all elements necessary  
for the success of an event, the events manager must be in possession of all infor-  
mation relating to each event.  
For this reason – the vital need to collate and possess all relevant and comprehen-  
sive information – a venue which hosts events should have the structure where  
one staff member handles each event in its entirety per event.  
This follows the same principle as organisations that structure their employees so  
that one person is responsible for a client account – an account manager.  
So, the venue’s events manager is solely responsible for each event, beginning to  
end.  
If the venue hosts events frequently and there exists an events department with  
an events team, there must also exist a hierarchy, but still adopting the one per-  
son management structure \(one person per event, beginning to end\).  
The hierarchical structure of an events department at a non-dedicated or unusual  
venue may be as seen in Figure 9.1. 56 The management of event venues  
Head of Events  
Events Assistant  
Figure 9.1 hierarchical structure of an events department at a non-dedicated  
or unusual venue  
In the hierarchical structure seen in Figure 9.1, the head of events may otherwise  
be referred to as ‘event manager’.  
The events assistant will perform back-up and operational duties at the event.  
The hierarchical structure of an events department at a dedicated \(purpose-built\)  
venue may be as seen in Figure 9.2.  
In Figure 9.2, it can be seen how the levels of business from events will impact  
the size of the event department at the venue. Here, the structure is less flat and  
more pyramidal in nature.  
Where a venue hosts many events, or is a purpose-built venue for events, there  
will be the need for an even larger and wider team of specialists in their field,  
such as a technical manager.  
The head of events oversees the running of the department, including sales,  
marketing, and staffing. They may become less operational due to these other  
responsibilities that go into running a department, but they will still oversee op-  
erational standards and procedures, and customer service. In this way, they adopt  
a holistic view, but remain directly involved with the management and running of  
events under their jurisdiction.  
The event co-ordinators \(acting as account handlers\) are each allocated their  
events to work on from start to finish.  
In a venue with fewer events, there could be just one co-ordinator. In a venue with  
a portfolio of events, there may be three or more co-ordinators.  
What remains key with the hierarchy at all venues is to maintain the structure  
whereby one staff member handles each event from beginning to end. The Berners one-person management structure 57  
Head of Events

Co-ordinator\(s\)

Figure 9.2 proposed hierarchical structure of an events department at a dedi-  
cated \(purpose-built\) venue  
This is an important criterion so that the client does not get passed from person to  
person. It would be inefficient for the venue – and detrimental experience for the  
­ client – for a venue to develop a structure whereby the client places their enquiry  
with a receptionist, gets passed to the sales manager, then has a show-round con-  
ducted by the head of events, then confirms their event to the head of events, who  
in turn transfers the client to an events co-ordinator. In some cases, the client might  
then be transferred to the chef to answer menu queries, to the bar manager for  
drinks queries, and to the technical manager for queries relating to sound and light.  
A client does not need to know the hierarchical structure of any venue. Nor  
should a client receive a diminished service or experience because of it. What a  
client expects – and deserves – is a seamless experience from the point of enquiry  
to the point of exit. Everything which occurs between – the ‘client experience’ –  
should be between client and organiser only\: nobody else!  
One person responsible for each event is essential for the following professional  
and practical reasons.  
9.1 Client relationship  
The venue must achieve good relationships with event clients from the outset.  
This is valuable in converting the enquiry to a sale. This is far more effective on  
a one-to-one basis, where the client and the events manager develop a working  
relationship and an understanding of each other’s needs from the very beginning. 58 The management of event venues  
If the client is passed to other people in the venue or is asked to work with a  
delegation from the venue, such as the chef, bars manager, security manager …  
it can create a ‘cross-contamination’ of information because each department has  
different priorities and needs. Plus, the client is less likely to form strong relation-  
ships across a wider range of personnel.  
The venue-to-client relationship is the cornerstone of a successful event and it must  
be built upon at every opportunity. If a client is passed around, the process of build-  
ing relationships has to begin all over again, which is a nonsense way to run a venue.  
9.2 Receiving information  
When the venue is receiving information from the client, it must be received at  
one point \(one person\).  
Practically, it is better for the client to deal with one person so that they feel con-  
fident that the information is being received by the right person. It also makes it  
easier for the client to have one point of contact with whomever is dealing with  
their event, and they will not be chasing different people at the venue.  
If the events manager needs to obtain information from other departments, so  
be it. But, it is not for the client to chase various departments for information.  
Furthermore, if a client is allowed to pass information to the venue via a range of  
people in various departments, it is inevitable that something will be forgotten  
or not passed along the chain. Invariably, this will only become apparent when it  
is too late to remedy.  
9.3 Disseminating information  
With one person responsible for each event, all information will be consistent  
when passed to various departments, staff and suppliers.  
9.4 Onsite event management  
The events manager will already be in possession of generic information from  
each department, such as sample menus from the chef, drinks prices from the  
bar manager, and the range of equipment available from the technical manager.  
Thereafter, it is the events manager’s role to liaise with each head of department  
about each event’s specific requirements.  
When it comes to the day of the event, the one event manager who is responsible  
for the event will possess all information and knowledge, and will be onsite to  
ensure the right things happen at the right time and in the right place. The Berners one-person management structure 59  
The flow of information back and forth must be channelled through the one  
event manager so that nothing gets missed and – vitally – all information on the  
day of the event is known by the one person in authority \(the event manager\).  
It is also expected that the event manager possesses established relations with  
event providers – sound and lighting companies, event caterers, marquee hire  
companies, florists … and is in possession of procurement details such as costs  
and delivery times. This generic information can be at hand as a guide for when  
a client requires, even at the enquiry stage. It would not be efficient for the event  
manager to spend time gathering this generic information from providers for  
every enquiry, especially as some enquiries may not convert to bookings.  
It can be seen how valuable it is for one person to control the event from enquiry  
to conclusion. It limits the risk of elements being missed, forgotten, or miscom-  
municated. Events management is about minimising risk.  
If the barrier to this one-person management structure is the belief that more  
people need to be involved in case that ‘one’ person is not available \(due to sick-  
ness, perhaps\), well the management procedures in place at the venue should  
be such that a nominated person could step in, pick up the event file and know  
everything about the event. \(These procedures are discussed at length in my pre-  
vious book, The Practical Guide to Organising Events.\)  
If the one-person management structure in in place, the need for liaison with various  
departments \(or suppliers\), will be conducted by the events manager. This will pre-  
vent departments liaising with each other, without inclusion of the event manager.  
The same applies when liaising between the client and other departments, other  
departments with suppliers, and the client with suppliers. It should all be con-  
ducted via the event manager. This is to prevent the event manager being ex-  
cluded from conversations relating to the event.  
The point here is that the event manager will conduct liaisons and meetings with  
all parties, and will attend any such meetings.  
It is a severe operational mistake to allow the client to liaise directly with other  
people who will be working the event, whether employed at the venue or other-  
wise, because discussions would take place outside the event manager’s knowl-  
edge. If this is allowed to happen, this would be the point – right here – where the  
event manager lost control of the management of that event.  
Even in the common situation of clients attending a menu tasting with the chef  
\(or catering manager, or outside caterer\), the event manager must still be in at-  
tendance to make notes of the comments, requirements and final agreed menu.  
It can be seen that if the client were to make comments and adjustments to 60 The management of event venues  
the menu with the chef but without the event manager, the event manager  
would not be party to what was discussed. Apart from the event manager being  
­ excluded from the process, a menu tasting is yet another relationship-building  
opportunity where the event manager can build rapport with the client as well as  
learning more about their likes and dislikes.  
A common failure with venues of all types – whether dedicated or non-dedicated,  
busy with events or not – is that there is not one person solely responsible for the  
management of events and event clients.  
In smaller venues, a client can get passed around various managers, depending  
upon whomever happens to be in the office at the time. It can be pot-luck who  
the client speaks to, depending on who answers the phone. This not only occurs  
at the enquiry stage \(which would be bad enough\), but throughout the entire  
event-handling procedure. A client may have placed the enquiry, confirmed the  
booking, had the show-round, and still find themselves being passed to the chef,  
the bar manager, the technical manager …  
But even larger venues with a structured event team may not be fully aware how  
the client process is impacted by passing clients through a system and not having  
the one-person approach. Many venues still do not provide direct contact to the  
events department which means a client will first speak to a receptionist, reser-  
vationist, sales person or call handler.  
Author’s voice box  
I know a four-star hotel with over 100 weddings each year but still no  
direct line for a client to speak to the events department.  
In this hotel, reception receives all calls, which is not unusual practice.  
But will the events manager know how many event enquiry calls were  
not answered because reception was busy with check-ins, check-outs,  
with other calls, or was unattended at the time?  
And what if the event enquiry is answered at reception, but was mishan-  
dled? Or the potential client asked a question and received an incorrect  
answer?  
If the events team are professionals and specialists at client handling  
and winning events business, it is they who should receive the enquiry\:  
this of course is the first step of the one-person management structure. The Berners one-person management structure 61  
Some venues evolve their events team to the extent where everybody is doing  
everything. This will result in overstaffing the events department because ineffi-  
ciencies occur due to blurred lines of responsibility.  
Clients will feel the consequence of this, and so the profitability of the venue can  
suffer.  
It can also have the effect of distancing the head of events from the operational  
aspects of the department because their role becomes defined by managing a  
busy department. In other words, they evolve from an event manager to a de-  
partment manager. This is a problem because the head of events is usually the  
member of the team with the most experience of events management. They need  
to uphold standards, devolve their experience and knowledge, and demonstrate  
leadership. They cannot achieve this if running the department forces them to  
spend all day in an office.  
The one-person management structure can also fail at non-dedicated venues that  
host events infrequently. With such venues, the rationale may be that a full-time  
events manager is not required, so it does not matter who does it.  
However, it is precisely this type of venue that can fail at events because of their  
inconsistency with the management of events, their inexperience of event organ-  
isation, and because their event procedures are not well practised. This is a mix  
which requires strong one-person management for efficient client management.  
Author’s voice box  
I visited a venue for a show-round on behalf of a client who would be  
holding a presentation followed by a party.  
This venue was once a military building with architectural interest, so it  
was not built for the purpose of events \(non-dedicated venue\).  
However, the venue was being purpose-run as an events venue and  
marketed itself as such, so I reasonably expected the staff to be experi-  
enced, well organised and proficient in running events.  
The venue show-round was conducted by the general manager, who  
subsequently emailed me his proposal.  
After this, a director telephoned me and asked me to attend a meeting.  
At this meeting, the director informed me that the general manager had  
overstepped his limits of authority and the proposal was invalid. 62 The management of event venues  
At this point, the director and I renegotiated the proposal.  
After that meeting, I was introduced to the venue’s ‘event manager’  
who was to be my point of contact from then on.  
So, why was the event manager not handling the enquiry and proposal  
procedures?  
It did not take very long for me to realise this was a venue without an  
effective management structure, and that if the venue’s structure was  
disjointed so would be their management of the event.  
I could not recommend this venue to my client. Chapter 10  
# The role of the venue  
It can be helpful to recognise that there are three types of event organiser.  
1 The venue’s event manager employed in-house.  
2  
The client.  
3 The events specialist – who could be a freelance event manager, an event  
agency, or an event company contracted by the client to run their event.  
It is not unusual for all three types of event manager to be involved with organis-  
ing one event. This will be where the client contracts an events specialist to run  
the event at a venue with an in-house event manager.  
Each of these will consider themselves to be in charge of organising the event.  
To compound the issue of who is in charge, there can be sponsors, a catering  
company, production manager, PR company, marketing company, and a security  
company. All of whom want to make the decisions.  
To avoid confusion – and conflicts – it is necessary to identify the ‘real’ event organ-  
iser. This is the person whom has the most knowledge and experience of what is be-  
ing organised, and it is not a static solution. So, where issues involving the venue are  
concerned, the other organisers must elevate the venue event manager to be the ‘real’ 64 The management of event venues  
event organiser. Likewise, when technical issues are being discussed, the other or-  
ganisers must deem the technical manager to be the ‘real’ event organiser, and so on.  
This makes sense because the venue manager knows more about this venue than  
the other organisers, and the technical manager knows more about the technical  
elements. This may seem obvious, but is very often assumed, overlooked, forgot-  
ten about, or simply not understood.  
But, because the event is happening at a venue, and the venue’s reputation is at  
stake, and for the sake of the safety of everybody at that venue, it is the venue  
events manager who must ascertain who is experienced at what.  
Indeed, the venue manager must get to understand the level of events experience  
the client has. If the client has engaged an events specialist, the venue manager  
must not assume, but ascertain the level of experience of the specialist. Some event  
‘specialists’ are in the business of organising events, but may be inexperienced be-  
cause they are truly a marketing company – or at least they may be inexperienced  
in this type of event. Many events specialists do have all-round events experience,  
but some hone their skills in one sector of the events industry. A freelancer who  
specialises in organising conferences, for example, may not possess the skills for  
organising a fashion show. The venue manager must understand this.  
It is not always clear whether a client \(or a specialist for that matter\) has experi-  
ence of events management. Some clients will adopt a professional stance and pre-  
tend they know the business of events. Or, they might have a level of pride where  
they would not admit or display their knowledge shortfalls. And, if it is an events  
‘specialist’, they will be less likely to reveal their inadequacies or knowledge gaps.  
Not all clients have limited knowledge. Some clients possess good experience  
of events – even if they are not the events manager, but the marketing manager,  
sales manager or PR manager – they might have been involved with organising  
many events, especially if they are employed by a large organisation which puts  
on a portfolio of events.  
Even if a client brings in an events specialist to a project, it cannot be assumed  
that the client is naive when it comes to managing events. Often, clients hire spe-  
cialists for their specialist knowledge, creativity or technical requirements – or  
they simply like to rely on someone they know, particularly if they have a loyal  
support or a friend. For this reason, many event clients have their preferred spe-  
cialists that they work with on a regular basis.  
So, it is important to untangle the knotted threads that bind these events organ-  
isers – the decision makers – who come together at one event\: this would be the  
venue manager, the client, and the specialist. Otherwise, everybody will be pulling  
against each other as they seek to demonstrate their expertise over each other  
decision maker. When this happens, the knots tighten and conflict will happen. The role of the venue 65  
Some venues only bother to understand the level of experience of their clients so  
as to learn the knowledge gaps and thus exploit the sales opportunities.  
Author’s voice box  
At one event, I was in the role of the events specialist and my client was  
an internet marketing specialist.  
After the event, the venue events manager expressed surprise to me  
that my client didn’t know much about organising events.  
I explained that she was widely experienced in marketing internet web-  
sites, not organising events.  
Only then, *after* the event, did it transpire that the venue had assumed  
my client was an events organiser.  
The responsibility for this miscommunication rested with us all. I  
knew my client’s job, so I didn’t think to impart that information to  
the venue.  
Or, perhaps my client should have introduced her job title and role to  
the venue manager.  
However, the venue didn’t know my client’s job and had failed to ask for  
this information, and it is this lack of knowledge which had made it *their*  
responsibility to ask.  
It is for the events manager employed at the venue to ascertain the experi-  
ence of the client and the level of support they require.  
This level of communication – the act of understanding who is the ‘real’ event  
manager – is important to overcome miscommunications. It will also reduce  
conflict between each decision maker. Further, it will bond the organisers and  
strengthen their relationship. After all, this is all about pulling together to achieve  
the objective of a successful event.  
More than the above, it will prevent assumptions and highlight gaps in knowl-  
edge and skills.  
It is important for the success of the event and its effective planning, that the  
event organisers assess each-other and identify where lie the strengths, weak-  
nesses and breadth of experience – that is why they have come together for the  
project. 66 The management of event venues  
This is also an important way to identify the limits of experience of the team. If  
there is limited experience identified among the management team, there is an  
opportunity to overcome the situation by outsourcing a professional who pos-  
sesses that particular expertise. If the limits have not been recognised, the suc-  
cess of the event may suffer.  
Clearly, a bride and groom organising their wedding will likely have limited  
experience of organising events. They will rely on the venue to advise them on  
every aspect of the happy occasion. A venue manager should recognise this,  
easily.  
It is less obvious with corporate clients and events specialists, however.  
In cases where a ‘private client’ is organising the event, such as a wedding or  
birthday party, the client is vulnerable to unscrupulous behaviour from venues.  
They can be overcharged for the hire of the venue; pay too much for catering; be  
cheated at the bar; and receive little or no support and guidance.  
This is not only true for naive brides and grooms, or first-time party organisers.  
Corporate clients with little experience of organising events are vulnerable to  
exploitation.  
A professional venue will advise and assist the client, whereas a ‘wrong’ venue  
may exploit a client’s naivety.  
This is another reason why clients stick with organisers \(and venues\) they know  
and trust.  
Author’s voice box  
When I was the venue events manager for the London Hippodrome in  
Leicester Square, I often heard production companies inform their cli-  
ents that they needed to bring in much more sound equipment than was  
already in situ.  
This was ludicrous because this venue was a nightclub and had all the  
sound equipment it needed.  
If a client was savvy enough to spot this, some production companies  
would tell their clients that the imposing in-house sound system was  
good for music and clubbing, but not for voice and speech. The role of the venue 67  
Actually, the sound rig at the London Hippodrome was versatile enough  
to suit all modes of sound.  
Here, the sound companies were trying to sell more equipment into the  
event so that they could earn from equipment hire fees and commissions.  
It was astonishing to see sound stacks being lugged into a venue that  
had a vast sound system already onsite.  
As the venue manager, it was difficult for me to tell a client they were  
being fleeced by the specialist company they had engaged. Nor, could  
I point this out in front of the specialist company, because they would  
never again bring a client to my venue.  
All this sound … and I was mute!  
At the same venue, one of the largest furniture hire companies would  
often deliver chairs for events. After the event, the client would tele-  
phone me to say there were chairs not returned so could I please search  
the venue. I did this a few times, but never found any chairs.  
After this became a regular request, it became clear to me that the  
furniture company was charging clients for phantom ‘unreturned’ chairs.  
I began to worry that my venue would get the blame for not returning  
chairs, or losing them. So, whenever a client mentioned this company to  
me, I would recommend a different and trusted supplier for them to use.  
Whatever the experience of the client, and whether or not they have employed a  
specialist events manager, it is the venue events manager who is the specialist for  
their venue, and so they must position themselves to provide their clients with  
guidance and support.  
Above anything else, perhaps, a client is looking for guidance and support. Oth-  
erwise, they would do the job themselves.  
Of course, clients do not have time to do the job themselves – especially if their  
job role is not organising events, but marketing or public relations. But, the point  
is that nobody can organise an event by themselves. It takes a range of people  
with specialisms to bring together all the elements an event requires.  
Even events organisers, specialists and technicians cannot do it alone. So, a client  
must rely on the support and guidance of the specialists, and the specialists must 68 The management of event venues  
rely on the support and guidance of other specialists. If this is not allowed to  
happen \(by the principle of identifying the ‘real’ event manager\), the system fails.  
If each specialist – each person involved with the organisation of an event – places  
themselves in the position of using their own knowledge, experience and skills of  
organising events to advise others, their job is done.  
This is the basis of being an event organiser – to advise others.  
For the venue to perform this role of advising other people using their venue, the  
venue events manager must have the relevant experience and knowledge of events –  
including statutory and health and safety regulations. Here is another reason why  
all venue managers should be trained and qualified in events management.  
For even if the client is very experienced at managing events, they will not know  
the limitations and idiosyncrasies of the venue.  
And, if the client has engaged an events specialist, still the specialist will not  
know the limitations and idiosyncrasies of the venue \(unless they have worked  
that venue before\).  
Thus, for the venue manager not to provide guidance and support to all clients  
and organisers, whether experienced or not, would be a failure to meet their re-  
sponsibilities and they would be negligent in their duty.  
To an events specialist or an experienced client, the limitations and idiosyncra-  
sies of venues should appear obvious. Here are a few of the common ones.  
• Pillars or columns which restrict the view of the stage and interrupt sight-lines.  
• Balconies which are higher than the lowest part of the ceiling and restrict  
the view of the stage.  
• Low ceiling height, which prevents the ability to hang projectors, lights, con-  
fetti canons, balloon nets.  
• An auditorium that does not allow for raked seating \(where each row is  
higher than the row in front, so that seated guests can see above the heads  
of people seated in front of them\).  
• Limited dressing room and backstage facilities.  
• Restricted delivery access.  
• Lack of onsite parking.  
• No exterior lighting.  
• No blackout facilities \(to prevent daylight and sunlight entering the space –  
this is particularly important when using projection\). The role of the venue 69  
• Restrictions on food and drink \(historic venues may not allow red wine  
or brown food which can stain carpets, rugs and marble floors. Some  
venues will not allow standing eating such as buffets and canapés, but  
will ­ allow seated dining where food is less likely to get dropped on to the  
floor\).  
But, even where the limitations of a venue are obvious, each venue is unique  
and there may be idiosyncrasies of which a client or an events specialist would  
be unaware. These would include how the flow of people works in various rooms,  
corridors and toilet areas; what works where in terms of where the cloakroom  
should be located or where the bar should be positioned; safety procedures, such as  
assembly areas; and safety risks, such as slippery surfaces, steps, trip hazards and  
uneven surfaces.

I recently attended a presentation in an unusual venue – a historic  
garrison with a circular courtyard with a glass roof and a cobblestone  
floor.  
The acoustics of the venue were specific and should have been amazing.  
But, the hired sound system was inadequate. The sound got lost and the  
throng of voices from the assembled crowd was louder than the people  
speaking on the stage.  
Afterwards, the venue events manager told me that their in-house sys-  
tem was much better, but the client didn’t ask to use it and brought in  
their own sound equipment.  
Is this the client’s fault for not asking the venue, or the venue’s fault for  
not advising the client?  
Knowing this particular venue, I suspect they had wanted to charge  
more for their in-house sound system than the client had paid for hiring  
in a sound system.  
Whichever way it was, it reflected poorly on the venue to have an event  
where the sound was inadequate.  
And, it showed poorly on the venue events manager for allowing  
it to happen, letting down the venue, the client, the speaker who  
could not be heard on the stage, and the guests who attended this  
event. 70 The management of event venues  
Everything that happens at an event, reflects upon the venue.  
The venue events manager has a role to protect the reputation of the venue. It  
cannot be allowed for any aspect of an event to have a negative impact on clients  
or their guests.  
Guests attending events mostly have very limited knowledge and understanding  
of events management. What they experience is how they judge the event. So,  
wherever that event is taking place – the venue – is being judged also.  
This means guests tend to blame the venue for anything that counts for a negative  
experience.  
Reflecting on the preceding Author’s Voice Box – if the sound system was not good  
and the guests could not hear the speeches, nobody will consider whether the client  
was at fault for hiring an inadequate sound system. They will simply judge the venue.  
If the food at an event is cold or tasteless, the guests will afterwards talk about  
the poor food at that venue. They would not think to question whether the food  
was catered by an external caterer.  
Guests will remember poor experiences and this negativity can impact the busi-  
ness of a venue. Reputation matters.  
This is why the venue events manager must guide and support clients, regardless  
of their event experience\: to protect anybody from doing anything that could dam-  
age the reputation of the venue. It is always the venue’s reputation which is at risk.  
Author’s voice box  
Even the most experienced can get things wrong.  
When global music stars go on tour, their production crew follows them  
around the globe and are in control of every aspect of the performance,  
including the quality of sound.  
But, when a music star performs at an existing event – a festival, say –  
suddenly the artist’s management are not in control of every aspect of  
the event.  
This is exactly what happened with Beyoncé when she performed at the  
Warsaw Orange Festival in Poland. The venue was the national stadium  
of Poland and for reason unknown to me, the sound installation at that  
venue was inadequate. The role of the venue 71  
Thousands of Beyoncé fans had anticipated an amazing concert experi-  
ence, but left the event afterwards complaining bitterly about the poor  
quality of sound.  
Considering that the quality of sound is a fundamental element to get  
right for a concert, this reflected very poorly on the reputation of the  
venue. The venue being the country’s national stadium was of particu-  
lar embarrassment to the concert-goers, who had expected more from  
such a prestigious national asset.  
The wider consequence was the damage done to the reputation of  
­ Beyoncé as a performer.  
The problem could have been with Beyoncé’s management for  
not engaging a contractual assurance of sound quality. It could be  
with the technical crew for installing inferior sound. But, the venue  
­ allowed a global superstar to perform in Poland with inadequate  
sound.  
To underline that the above situation was primarily a fault by the venue,  
I later met with the venue’s director of miCE \(Meetings, Incentives, Con-  
ferences and Events\) and asked what the core business was at his venue.  
I expected him to say corporate events, concerts or sports events, but  
he answered ‘sales’.  
This answer told me that the focus of venue management at Poland’s  
national stadium was misplaced because they were solely interested  
in selling space\: it was purely commercial and success was measured  
entirely on the levels of business achieved – regardless of what that  
business was. Here was a venue being treated as a warehouse to fill with  
whatever could be put inside.  
In commercial business terms, this may be acceptable. But, not when it  
comes to the other elements of venue management – quality of events;  
quality of guest experiences at the event; profile of events; profile of the  
venue; professionalism; the right events for the qualities of the venue;  
providing a service; client management...  
Yes, a sales manager could answer that question with the word ‘sales’.  
But, a venue manager must consider the reputation of the venue and its  
profile in the community – especially if that venue manager is employed  
at a national stadium.  
It can be seen from this scenario how the wrong focus of attention had  
allowed substandard services to creep inside that venue. 72 The management of event venues  
Elements for which a venue is responsible\:  
• cleanliness and hygiene  
• service standards and the quality of service  
• presentation and aesthetics  
• condition of the venue  
• external appearance, including gardens, grounds and exterior lighting  
• maintenance  
• in-house catering  
• in-house sound and lighting  
• safety/risk assessment  
• security and crowd management  
• fire prevention  
• legal compliance  
• capacity levels  
• staffing  
• providing guidance to clients.  
Most of the above elements are legal requirements for the venue. Where there is  
no legal requirement, if something were to go wrong, it is usual for the law to be  
applied to whatever did go wrong\: there is no escaping the seriousness of manag-  
ing an event venue.  
It is not fun to be a venue manager. It is a responsibility.  
There are elements for which it could be thought a venue may not be responsible,  
such as hired-in facilities, external caterers, and hired-in staff. But even here it  
would be a mistake to consider that the venue is not responsible for any such  
elements not provided by the venue.  
The venue manager must be involved with hired-in elements so as to know what  
is arriving to the venue, when it should be delivered, and from whom. Delivery  
of items must be anticipated, as must receiving goods and storing goods, foods,  
valuables and equipment. It may require staff to accept deliveries and move items  
around the venue, and storage requirements may need to be arranged. The role of the venue 73  
So, it is still the venue manager’s duty to get involved with hired-in elements.  
The venue is responsible for the safety of staff, contractors and guests, and the  
venue is a key element in the success of the event. This means that whatever hap-  
pens at the venue is a risk to the success of any event held there, and potentially  
a risk to the people within it. Thus, every element – even the hired-in elements –  
must first be approved by the venue events manager.  
Furthermore, considering that every element of an event impacts the reputation  
of the venue, every element has to be considered as the responsibility of the venue.  
This is why good venues, which are protective of their good reputation, will only  
hire services from the venue’s approved list of suppliers.  
A venue must know what is going on and what their client is up to. Control is  
essential. Chapter 11  
# Procuring external  
# services  
A good venue will not allow any resources or elements in to their venue if  
there is a risk of compromising health and safety, hygiene or legality. This  
must extend to service standards, quality, and the risk of not meeting  
expectations.  
The venue must maintain control.  
As an example, to serve guests with food from an unknown or unapproved ca-  
terer is a risk to the venue because the food element of the event would now be  
out of the venue’s control.  
In such a situation, the venue must have procedures in place to regain control of  
the food element at the event. Such procedures could include meeting with the  
proposed caterer, researching the caterer’s reputation, having a menu tasting,  
monitoring the food quality and service during the event, and obtaining post-  
event feedback from guests about the food at the event.  
If the food provided to guests is substandard, it will reflect negatively  
on the venue \(not the caterer and not the client\). Guests rarely know who  
supplied the catering, so will assume it was the venue without giving it much  
thought. Procuring external services 75  
For business reasons, venues prefer their clients to use in-house catering rather  
than clients paying an outside caterer to come in and cater the event. This is be-  
cause in-house catering is an important revenue stream for a venue.  
A venue makes money from hiring their space to event clients, but generates addi-  
tional income from food sales, bar sales, and other sales streams such as charging  
for specialist staff, providing entertainment, and supplying technical equipment.  
But, it would be unfair for a venue to insist that the client must use their in-house  
equipment and facilities, including catering. Some venues do insist upon this and  
will refuse the option for a client to use external caterers. There is no reason for  
this because there are ways around protecting the quality of catering provided,  
protecting the venue’s reputation, and protecting the revenue stream.  
It is wrong and unfair for a venue to refuse external services. Some corporate  
clients may have a contractual arrangement with a specific event caterer, or they  
have a preferred caterer because they have used them before and particularly  
enjoy their food. Often it is a matter of trust, loyalty or friendship and the client  
has a usual caterer upon which they feel they can rely. This is often the case with  
event specialists who work with caterers all over the place, all the time.  
Clients \(and an event specialist is a client of the venue, remember\) have the right  
of choice, after all, and it is an obligation for the venue to allow that right of choice.  
So, instead of refusal, the venue can prevaricate. It is a less negative approach and  
can be considered as guidance, rather than insistence. It is the ‘nudge’ theory,  
whereby the client is nudged into making the required decision.  
To get around the loss of income from catering, the venue will charge the client  
a fee for bringing in an external caterer. This provides income from the catering  
element which would otherwise be lost and thus protects this particular revenue  
stream.  
The venue should be happy with this arrangement because they have none of the  
costs – food, staff, etc. – but receive revenue for no outlay\: pure profit.  
To protect their reputation the venue can provide clients with a list of recom-  
mended \(or approved caterers\) with whom the venue has experience and trust  
in the service and product that will be provided. Often, these approved caterers  
would have worked the venue before, especially in venues where there is no in-  
house catering.  
If the approved list of caterers is well compiled, listing reputable caterers, it is  
likely that the client’s preferred caterer is on the list. Or perhaps there is a caterer 76 The management of event venues  
on the list that is known to the client. This approved-list system ensures quality  
of catering and provides the client with choice.  
If the client \(or event specialist\) wishes to bring in a caterer that is not on the ven-  
ue’s approved list, the venue can meet with the caterer to ascertain their profes-  
sionalism and can ask for a menu tasting to judge the quality of food to be served  
in their venue at the event. If the venue is reputable, they will know very quickly  
whether the proposed caterer is professional and reliable. This is often the case  
with specialised menu requirements such as kosher or Indian wedding cuisine.  
There should be no reason to refuse to explore the outside catering option, espe-  
cially when using persuasion and the approved-list system. However, if a venue  
wishes to deter a client from bringing in an outside caterer but does not wish to  
flatly refuse the request, the venue may quote a substantially high outside cater-  
ing fee. This would dissuade a client from bringing in an outside caterer. Do not  
forget that this fee for outside catering is additional to how much the client would  
pay the caterer, so the client might just as well pay for in-house catering and not  
have to pay the outside fee on top.  
Furthermore, a venue should be in a strong position to persuade a client to take  
in-house catering. Why would a client choose not to use the venue’s catering?  
Logistically, it is simpler and lessens the risks because the in-house kitchen bri-  
gade are familiar with the venue and its kitchen equipment. This makes them the  
best chefs to provide the food at this venue. Also, everything relating to catering  
would be onsite already without the risks of non-delivery, delays due to traffic, or  
missing items not delivered to the venue on the day of the event.  
If the client remains unconvinced, the venue manager can offer a menu tasting  
to counter any uncertainty. In any case – in-house catering or otherwise – menu  
tastings should always be offered so that there is no ambiguity about menu items,  
flavours, appearance of dishes, or portion sizes.  
It remains the interest of the venue to provide in-house catering and be in control  
of the food element of the event, just as with every other element. So, it should  
be one of the guidance roles for the venue event manager to convince the client  
to use in-house catering. If the client insists on outside catering, this is where  
the fee for bringing in an outside caterer comes into play. The amount charged  
for this is not about greed, but persuasion in the interests of a successful event.  
Where there is a need for specialist catering, such as kosher, which is outside  
the capability of the in-house chefs, there is less need to either deter or convince  
a client to use in-house catering. Even so, the venue would still realise a loss  
of revenue from outsourcing catering. So, a venue in this case could either ap-  
ply the outside catering fee, as outlined above, or could waive the fee in lieu of Procuring external services 77  
guaranteed income from other streams, such as bar or accommodation. Some  
venues use this method as a sales tool and would rather have a guaranteed spend  
\(guaranteed level of income regardless of which stream\) instead of offending a  
client by applying an additional charge for outside catering.  
The point of an approved list of suppliers is threefold\:  
1 For the venue to maintain control of risks, legalities, hygiene, safety, quality  
and standards.  
2 For the venue to protect its reputation.  
3 For the venue to provide choice to the client while maintaining control of  
which supplier is used.  
There are logistical issues as well. It is far less problematic – and less risky – to  
use suppliers who know the venue and the standards required of that venue.  
Even if it is simply a delivery of items – furniture, perhaps – if the supplier does  
not have a relationship with the venue, the venue cannot control this element.  
The supplier may not deliver on time; may miscalculate the journey time or the  
route; may not know the traffic levels en route; or may have trouble finding the  
venue. These are risks that do not exist when using facilities that are already at  
the venue.  
Another thing is that if the supplier does not know the venue, they have no loy-  
alty established. So they don’t care if they let the venue down – they have never  
worked there before and may never be asked to work there again. Therefore, it  
makes sense to use the venue’s approved suppliers who care about ongoing busi-  
ness being referred to them by the venue. The supplier will need to protect their  
own reputation so as to maintain their association with the venue and continue  
their inclusion on the venue’s approved list of suppliers.  
11.1 Management of catering outlets  
Contribution from Jennifer Kaye  
There are numerous premises and venues which can be utilised for food and  
beverage services. Catering outlets are diverse and may include sports stadia,  
concert venues, mobile catering vans, food stands, marquees, restaurants, cafés,  
licensed retail outlets, conference and meetings rooms, and other hospitality and  
events venues.  
Catering services provided may range from light refreshments, teas and coffees;  
to pies, burgers and hot dogs; or an à la carte menu, buffets or champagne bars. 78 the management of event venues  
Each catering outlet provides its own challenges for a manager such as staffing,  
adhering to food hygiene and legislative requirements, logistics, food storage and  
operational costs.  
The business environment presents additional challenges in terms of rising food  
costs, rising labour costs aligned with the National Living Wage, security con-  
cerns given the ongoing threat of terrorism, and staffing issues further impacted  
by the decision for the UK to leave the European Union.  
Despite these and other challenges, the hospitality and events industries continue  
to grow, providing numerous business opportunities and encouraging innovation,  
growth and job opportunities for catering outlets.  
11.1.1 Contract catering  
The larger contract catering companies may be contracted to provide food,  
drinks, hospitality, and events services to venues ranging from conference cen-  
tres to schools, sports stadia and hospitals.  
Contract catering may also be referred to as outside catering which can be sup-  
plied by smaller independent and local companies providing either one off or on-  
going catering services to different venues, clients, private homes, events, social  
clubs or village halls.  
Staffing is an ongoing challenge for contract caterers, especially where business  
demands fluctuate and regular hours cannot always be guaranteed to staff. Events  
is a fluctuating business and is particularly susceptible to peaks and troughs of  
demand.  
There can also be a tendency for last-minute bookings or changes to potential  
numbers of attendees to events.  
Because of this, contract caterers, like many hospitality businesses, may be  
heavily reliant on hourly paid staff employed under zero-hours contracts, and  
may often need to utilise more costly agency staff to make up staff shortages.  
Staff employed by contract caterers can be known as ‘outside’, ‘contracted’ or  
‘casual’ staff and may work at the same venue on a regular basis despite not be-  
ing directly employed by that venue.  
A contract caterer could be likened to a staffing agency, and regular staff may be  
interviewed and appointed to work within a venue via a catering manager who is  
employed by the contract caterer based at that venue. Procuring external services 79  
Alternatively, where a venue does not have its own in-house team or contracted  
catering team, an external event organiser will directly retain a contract caterer  
themselves.  
Contract catering staff may be required to work at different venues and for dif-  
ferent clients in both the local area, region, UK or even Europe. This offers an  
exciting career for individuals – there is an opportunity to work within numerous  
venues and/or events and for a frequent change of environment and the challenge  
of working somewhere unfamiliar and not routine.  
Contract caterers can provide venues and clients with flexible staffing as and  
when events dictate a need for staffing, even at short notice, and can utilise these  
staff according to business demands without having to directly recruit their own  
team and take on those costs.  
A venue working with an external contract caterer has an opportunity to save on  
labour costs and logistics of recruitment.  
This can present issues in terms of the consistency of staff, team-building, and  
quality management which can impact the level of client/customer service and  
satisfaction. Staff teams that are regularly changeable impede customer rela-  
tionships and inevitably training and experience varies thus impacting on service  
times and quality standards.  
It could be argued that it is the responsibility of both the contract caterer and the  
venue to agree set service standards and to provide guidance where necessary.  
Certainly, Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) such as client feedback, guest feed-  
back and quality levels should be set into the contract or Service Level Agreement  
\(SLA\) with tools of measurement and review dates.  
It is usual for concert venues, schools, hospitals and sports stadia around the UK to  
issue a tender to contract caterers, to invite bids for the contract within a given venue  
or number of venues. This enables the venue to select a catering organisation which  
represents value for money and quality that aligns with core corporate values.  
Once a tender is won, a contract caterer will supply products and services pro-  
vided by their own suppliers and their own staff to be utilised at any events within  
that venue. This may present challenges to the venue – a caterer may change  
products such as hot food, branded beverages or confectionery that may not  
align with customer expectations. Also, staff may need additional product train-  
ing. Different equipment and displays may be needed \(which may take time to  
install\) and pricing will need to be negotiated as a proportion of the profits are  
allocated to both parties. 80 the management of event venues  
JenniFEr’s voice box  
In response to increasing environmental pressures and in order to be  
more sustainable, a brewery changed their beer barrels to plastic dis-  
pensers. This not only saved space in a venue’s cellar but also removed  
the need for gas canisters.  
As beer gets dispensed, the new system automatically puts gas in to the  
beer and the plastic self-compacts as the beer is drawn, which enables  
easy disposal for recycling.  
The new system had been installed to a venue the day before a large  
public event and the engineers were still onsite.  
However, when it came to serving the beer, the system did not work and  
engineers were unable to solve the problem before the end of service,  
leading to a number of customer complaints and revenue losses.  
Luckily, the venue also stocked bottled beer. But this product soon ran out.  
Things do not always run smoothly despite best intentions, so it is al-  
ways wise to have a substitute available.  
In terms of a couple organising a wedding, or a corporation organising an event,  
a diverse range of venues are available and each venue is likely to operate a pre-  
ferred list of caterers or require the event organisers to arrange their own caterers.  
In such cases, once the outside caterer has been appointed, they will prepare  
the majority of the food at their own premises and will likely have a workspace or  
production kitchen in which to store, prepare and finish food ready for service.  
Depending on facilities and space at the venue, a caterer may need to supply  
their own ovens, hobs, cookware, refrigerated units, bars, drinks, table cloths,  
glasses, cutlery, crockery, centrepieces, and cooking and other appliances. This  
can increase costs for the caterer as equipment may need to be purchased or  
hired, such as a refrigerated vehicle to safely store produce, meat, food, drinks  
and ice. Sometimes, these costs are charged to the client or venue. Either way,  
this can be a costly operation and require a lot of planning, and may additionally  
present challenges in terms of food safety and hygiene practices. Regular food  
temperature and storage temperatures will need to be recorded and records kept  
to evidence due diligence if any concerns are raised and to comply with Food  
Safety and Food Hygiene Regulations. Procuring external services 81  
11.1.2 Concert and sports stadia  
Unlike any other industry, the hospitality sector is a service sector and an  
unsold ticket or empty seat is lost revenue. This makes supply and demand  
somewhat unpredictable and when catering for concerts or sporting events,  
knowing how to effectively maintain stock levels and provide adequate staffing  
is complicated.  
The undersupply of food and drink will lead to guest complaints and damage to a  
venue’s reputation – even if the problem is caused by the outside caterer.  
Oversupply can lead to the caterer experiencing wastage, lost revenue and com-  
promised profit margins.  
To effectively plan for events a historical record of event attendance and sales  
should be kept recording how much food and drink was sold or wasted, the av-  
erage spend per head and the staffing numbers. This will help determine future  
budgets, the average number of staff needed, appropriate stock levels based on  
previous sales, and required food preparation when planning future events of a  
similar nature.  
Consideration should also be given to factors such as the weather and type of  
event as to the types of products or services that need to be offered.  
On a cold day more hot food and hot drinks would be expected to be sold, and on  
a hot day more soft drinks and alcohol would probably be sold.  
The profile of guests attracted to an event is a critical factor, also. At a football  
match demand will be for pies and pastries, and beer. At a pop concert it might  
be prosecco, beer, water, and burgers and chips.  
Considering local league football and cricket stadia, these medium-sized venues  
may have both concourse catering and executive hospitality areas providing a  
range of products and services from bars and food stands, to full dinner service  
and mobile beer vendors.  
It is common to have eight, 28 or more bars with between two and eight staff in  
each. This presents high staff costs and recruiting challenges to maintain the  
correct levels of staff, especially where events are not held very often at a venue.  
Some sporting venues will hold other events such as tribute nights, concerts,  
meetings and conferences to optimise business levels and thus staffing issues  
will vary venue to venue depending on whether staff are given a reliable source  
of income or not. 82 the management of event venues  
Apart from full-time and core personnel, this type of flexible employment is nor-  
mally desirable for students, those who desire a second job, those who want  
causal hours, or retirees wanting to work on occasion.  
Concert venues may hold events more regularly and therefore may not experience  
staffing issues as much as sports stadia, as regular hours may be guaranteed  
providing staff with a regular source of employment in comparison.  
Staff therefore tend to be hourly paid, contracted under zero-hour contracts and  
may be allocated shifts at very short notice. This presents problems if large num-  
bers of staff are required, making staff shortages commonplace in the industry  
which further impacts on service standards and venue reputation. Agency staff  
may also need to be used to supplement gaps in the workforce.  
JenniFEr’s voice box  
I was once asked by a large contract caterer to work at a different  
football stadium to normal, which required me to travel from Essex to  
London.  
When I arrived at the stadium, I was allocated my first Stand Manager  
shift responsible for three bars during match day, with one bar being  
the busiest in the ground.  
In total, I was responsible for 18 staff members who were required to  
cook hot food such as pies, hot dogs and chips, and to serve drinks to  
customers.  
Across the three bars only two of the 18 staff had ever worked at that  
stadium previously and the rest of the staff were supplied by an agency.  
As I did not have time to train them all, I briefed one member of staff in  
each bar empowering them as the team leader who was then required  
to communicate to the rest of their team how to cook and prepare food  
and drinks and how to use the till system.  
Service was intense, but as the bars only open pre-match and up to the  
end of half-time, humour helped the team members survive the shift,  
and customers were patient and understanding.  
At times like that, I remind staff that there is no need to panic or buckle  
under the pressure as eventually the shift will be over and they will have  
survived the shift – proving that working under pressure is a valuable  
skill to develop during shifts such as these. Procuring external services 83  
11.1.3 Restaurants and bars  
Restaurants, cafes and bars provide customers with multiple options depending  
on the purpose of the customers’ visit, their budget, the occasion, their loyalty to  
a brand, or even mere convenience.  
Operating this type of venue requires purchasing or leasing a premises resulting  
in higher operating costs alongside payable rates and utilities.  
As well as securing a suitable venue, competition in the local area should be an-  
alysed to identify the type of food and beverages already offered, and pricing to  
determine where the new business fits into the marketplace, what product to offer  
and at what price points.  
A kitchen will be a necessity as food will need to be prepared, cooked and served  
onsite, appropriate licences will need to be held for alcohol service, playing mu-  
sic, live performances, television screens and dancing.  
The venue should have enough cutlery, plates, kitchen and bar space appropriate  
for the number of covers the bar or restaurant is capable of holding, and capacity  
should be monitored for health and safety, fire legislation requirements, and pub-  
lic liability insurance should a claim be made against the venue.  
Food Allergen Labelling legislation \(the EU Food Information for Consumers Reg-  
ulation\) places responsibility on hospitality businesses to display and be able to  
advise on the 14 allergens present in food served.  
It is also common practice for food businesses to provide a more expansive menu  
in terms of dietary requirements such as gluten-free, dairy-free and sugar-free;  
lower-fat options, and vegetarian and vegan options, as consumerism determines  
demand of a particular brand and therefore a venue should be responsive to cus-  
tomer needs and trends.  
In a bid to gain loyalty and a higher proportion of the available market, larger  
branded chains tend to offer ongoing discounts and other special offers such as  
buy-one-get-one-free, early-bird offers for those dining or drinking outside peak  
times, and special fixed-price menus. While these tactics may entice customers  
to a restaurant or bar, long-term discounting can damage both profitability and  
customer perception, and it can be difficult to revert back to original pricing.  
The menu may change daily, weekly or seasonally, and menu design should take  
this into consideration.  
If a menu is to change frequently, then it is advised to write the food and drink on  
chalk boards, or to print it on card; a menu that will be used for a number of weeks 84 the management of event venues  
or months will most likely be professionally printed, laminated or presented in a  
display book for durability.  
The menu and drink items should be reviewed regularly for profitability, availabil-  
ity and popularity, and any items not producing the desired profit or not selling  
well should be removed from the menu or adapted to increase popularity and  
profitability.  
Promotions, specials, and the use of staff up-selling can increase the popular-  
ity of a menu item, and reducing the portion size, the number of ingredients,  
or sourcing a cheaper supplier can improve the profitability margins of a menu  
item.  
A range of beverages should be offered to meet various customer demands and  
the type of venue will determine how expansive this is.  
A café may serve multiple hot drinks and soft drinks, but may decide not to serve  
alcohol. A branded restaurant chain may offer numerous soft drinks, a basic range  
of wines and other alcoholic beverages, while a fine dining restaurant may have an  
extensive wine list and offer a variety of spirits, aperitifs and liqueurs, ranging from  
recognised affordable brands to luxury brands.  
When considering what range to stock, thought should be given to the value and  
affordability of stock which may not necessarily be regularly consumed; for in-  
stance, stocking dozens of bottles of wine and expensive champagne may offer  
customers good choice, but may remain in stock for lengthy periods. It is harmful  
to the cash flow of a business to outlay for stock and hold it for long periods be-  
fore it is sold and achieves a return into the business.  
11.1.4 Conferences, meetings and small events  
There are a range of venues available for private hire and/or which offer events for  
the general public to attend.  
These vary from conference centres to hotels, castles and village halls; all of  
which provide different facilities and services.  
Not all venues provide in-house catering and may require a caterer to be ap-  
pointed, whether this is from a list of preferred caterers or one of the customers’  
choosing.  
It is typical for such venues to cater for breakfast meetings or conferences offer-  
ing either a breakfast buffet or pastries, teas and coffees, and buffet or plated  
lunches and dinners. Procuring external services 85  
In the case of a buffet, all food items must be labelled to help customers make  
informed choices and for allergen advice. Staff should monitor the buffet and ad-  
vise kitchen staff long before the item runs out if more is needed.  
A client will normally provide their own seating plan which the venue staff will  
use to set up tables and/or seating. A number of seating styles may be required  
such as theatre-style, whereby all seats face a stage or lectern with no tables;  
cabaret-style, with seats placed around one side of a table facing the front which  
is used for a conference with activities or a performance; or banqueting-style,  
with 8–12 chairs around a round table, normally used for formal dinners and  
celebrations.  
As these types of venues may hold events for large numbers of people, mass  
catering is necessary and meals will either be placed on a buffet for attendees to  
help themselves or plated service whereby the kitchen team will plate meals for  
one table at a time.  
This requires event timings to be communicated to both the service staff and  
kitchen brigade as service needs to be adapted to these timings to ensure that  
the meeting, conference or event runs to time.  
This can put pressure on the kitchen and thus food may be prepared in ad-  
vance and reheated for service with hot food often being held in a hot-hold  
unit, hot cupboard, or bain-marie. Cold items such as salads and desserts  
may be pre-plated and kept on a trolley in the fridges until service, when wait-  
ing staff will take plates directly from the trolley from the kitchen \(or another  
service area where the kitchen is not nearby, such as a side room or corridor\)  
to a table as directed by the Conference and Banqueting/Events Manager or  
Supervisor.  
For food service, the commodity most required by chefs is the availability of space  
for the preparation of food.  
Food is normally served one table at a time to ensure that all tables are served  
quickly, efficiently and correctly according to the table plan.  
Hot food will be plated by chefs one table at a time and service is more efficient  
and professional if one table can be served all at once; for example, five waiting  
staff carrying two plates each for a table of ten, with all ten plates being put down  
on the table simultaneously.  
Clearing this type of service will require trolleys or service stations to be set up,  
and only when every guest on a table has finished their meal should the team  
clear that table. 86 the management of event venues  
Empty plates should never be stacked on the table, as this looks unprofessional.  
Instead, one plate should be balanced on the wrist and food scraps scraped from  
this plate onto another plate held flat on top of the fingers. Cutlery should also be  
stacked on this latter plate.  
All remaining plates should be balanced on top of the plate on the palm and then  
taken to the service station, trolley or kitchen.  
Once the main course has been cleared, the condiments and any unused cutlery  
should be removed from the table.  
Then, the dessert cutlery is put in place for the sweet course.  
The same applies to buffet service, but depending on client requirements plates  
may be cleared from individuals if on different courses from one another.  
For plated service, food choices from a set menu are normally given in advance  
to simplify service and a list of dietary requirements recorded so the service team  
and kitchen brigade are aware of which table or customer has ordered a special  
dish to avoid any confusion. It is vital to get this correct because of food allergies  
and dietary preferences.  
Depending on formalities, the client, venue or caterer may have a list with guest names  
and what dish each has ordered, or a table plan identifying how many meals of each  
type are required at which tables. Otherwise, orders can be recorded on a place card  
with the guest’s name. Some guests may forget what they have ordered, so this may  
overcome any issues and spare meals should be prepared in case of any spillages or if  
a customer requests a different meal or an allergy becomes known.  
A separate bar team will normally be responsible for drinks orders to avoid  
disruption to food service and this team may also operate a table service for  
drinks and wines.  
11.1.5 Security  
Venue security has always been a necessary management responsibility, especially  
with large volumes of people gathering and the risk potential of incidents occurring  
from mob behaviour, violence, drug and alcohol consumption, or public disturbances.  
Due to terror attacks across the UK and Europe, further security measures have  
been put in place such as bag searches, preventing entry of liquids and chemi-  
cals, body scanning and drug checks.  
While inconvenient to guests, such measures cannot be ignored by managers and  
a security team should be appointed at venues where there are large crowds and Procuring external services 87  
also where late-night drinking takes place. Security checks can reassure venue  
guests and visitors.  
Police and councils require to be informed about events that require road closures  
or crowd management.  
Each venue should have its own risk assessment, accident reporting, and evac-  
uation procedures in place and all staff must be informed and trained in these.  
Car parks should ideally be located away from the main building to minimise risk of car  
bomb attacks, and bollards, statues or planters should be located around the build-  
ing to block any vehicle that may drive into the premises to cause structural damage.  
The ‘Run and Hide’ principles should also be considered when under threat from  
a terrorist attack and no attempt should be made to tackle perpetrators.  
JenniFEr’s voice box  
Following the terrorist attack on the Ariana Grande concert at the Man-  
chester Arena in 2017, a security team and sniffer dogs were brought in  
to assess security procedures and to train the events stewards in bomb  
prevention.  
This was reassuring for all venue staff.  
Unfortunately a fake bomb from one of the training exercises was left in  
the public toilets. This was discovered by one of the bar supervisors do-  
ing a venue check five minutes before the doors were due to be opened  
for an event.  
If a visitor had found the fake bomb it could have led to widespread  
panic and event cancellation, which would have been damaging to the  
venue’s reputation for its approach to security measures.  
11.2 Guiding the client  
It is always less risky for all parties to use in-house services, and it is up to the  
venue to guide their clients to understand this – or at least deter their clients from  
using external service providers where it is not necessary. 88 The management of event venues  
Weddings in particular tend to use external service providers\: the bride’s mother  
normally chooses the florist; there is often a relative or friend who makes the  
cake; and the DJ may be a friend of the bride’s uncle.  
It may make sense to the ‘client’ \(in the case of weddings, the client is a private  
individual – bride; bride and groom; bride’s mother – but a client, nonetheless\) to  
bring in these elements from people they know. From their point of view there is  
no problem with getting the cake from a family friend\: it will probably be cheaper  
than ordering a cake from the venue, anyway.  
But for the venue, the risks previously described – and the risk of losing out  
­ financially – still exist. In fact, for weddings, the risks could be considered greater  
because the ‘client’ is not a professional and most weddings tend to outsource  
from personal contacts to save money. It must be remembered that wedding  
‘  
­ clients’ are paying the bill from their pocket, not a corporate account, so the  
drive to save expenditure is personal.  
If the venue has control procedures in place, it must treat weddings in the same  
way as all clients.  
Therefore, the wedding client must be guided, persuaded, deterred.  
It cannot be emphasised enough that wedding clients are emotionally involved  
with the event. In addition, in most cases they will not have experience in events  
management, booking venues, nor procurement and outsourcing.  
It should be clear then, for a venue not to allow a wedding client to take control  
over some of the elements that go into the success of a wedding event.  
But because emotion is a wedding client’s prerogative, sensitivity must be de-  
ployed by the venue manager. In many cases it is as easy as explaining the risks  
and assuring the client that it is the venue’s job to take care of all the details.  
After all, the venue’s priority is to ensure that the clients have an enjoyable day\:  
why should they be stressing about deliveries and such things?  
The approved suppliers list is the leverage mechanism here. Wedding clients with  
little or no event-organising experience are susceptible to the venue’s knowledge,  
experience and advice. Really, the client is looking for flexibility and that right  
of choice.  
The approved suppliers list will provide them with a say in how their wedding runs.  
It should be emphasised that all the suppliers on the list are tested, trustworthy  
and have experience at the venue. There is no risk. And, in the case of disc jock-  
eys, the approved list ensures that they are licensed. Procuring external services 89  
Okay, the venue will take control and responsibility for all aspects of the wedding.  
Where the client cannot be persuaded and is bringing in elements for themselves,  
such as the cake or the DJ, control procedures must be introduced.  
These procedures are the same as with other events. The venue manager must  
meet with the suppliers, establish a relationship with them, and let them know  
the venue’s expectations of them. Emails should be exchanged so that there is no  
ambiguity and the agreements are more than verbal. Research can be done as to  
the professionalism of these suppliers.  
So, the venue needs control of all suppliers to the wedding. However, there is a  
financial aspect to consider as well.  
Financially, the approved list of suppliers for weddings – cake makers; florists;  
sweet carts; gifts; carriages; disc jockeys; photographers – are those who have a  
financial agreement with the venue, as well as the fact that they are trustworthy  
suppliers. Typically, the agreement will be commission-based, where the supplier  
provides a percentage of their charge to the venue for referring business to them.  
If the venue allows a wedding client to bring in their own elements, there is not  
only a risk of things going wrong, but a financial loss, too.  
Where a financial aspect has been negotiated with suppliers, it encourages the  
venue to find solutions to the problem of wedding clients sourcing their own  
elements for the event and losing control.  
There is a note of caution to add here for clients \(especially wedding clients who  
may be naive in organising events\). Some venues could recommend one supplier  
over another because of the financial gain through commission, rather than rec-  
ommending a supplier because of their reliability, or their service, or their cost,  
or their suitability to the event.  
Author’s voice box  
I know of a country house hotel that does allow wedding guests to bring  
in their own elements.  
On one occasion the client brought in their own DJ. At midnight, a  
member of staff asked the DJ to stop playing as this was the cut-off  
time in the event contract.  
But, the DJ had a full dancefloor and refused to stop playing. The staff  
member insisted, but the DJ stood his ground. Eventually, the member 90 The management of event venues  
of staff pulled out the plug and then a fight ensued between this mem-  
ber of staff and the DJ.  
The problem here is that even with a client/venue contract in place, the  
DJ had not been engaged by the hotel, and so the DJ did not feel obliged  
to do as the hotel said. The hotel had no control over the DJ’s behaviour.  
Control had been handed to the client.  
In this case it was the finish time which caused the problem, but in  
these situations it could be the playlist, the volume or the DJ consum-  
ing alcohol and becoming drunk – each of these are issues that need  
to be within the control of the venue.  
So, the DJ needs to be engaged by the venue, and must be an approved  
supplier who has a trusted working relationship with the venue. And,  
there needs to be loyalty built in\: if the DJ feels there is a risk of not get-  
ting another gig at this venue because of misbehaviour, they will behave.  
A venue should have a list of known or approved suppliers for everything an event  
may require\: flowers, decoration, furniture hire, sound equipment, lighting...  
It is in the interests of the venue to steer clients towards suppliers who know the  
venue and are reputable in their services. There are, after all, safety issues to con-  
sider, such as flame-retardant decorations. The venue must control such aspects.  
It is also in the interests of the client for the venue to recommend suppliers who  
know the venue or have a good reputation in the events industry. It is not for cli-  
ents to spend time researching suppliers in an industry with which they may be  
unfamiliar. Clients should be able to rely on their choice of venue to guide them  
and make recommendations.  
Guests will reflect positively on a venue where the event was good and successful.  
If things ran smoothly or were particularly impressive it becomes valuable pro-  
motion for the venue – the venue is on display at an event, after all.  
But, if things go wrong – if the sound system is inadequate, the staff are surly, or  
the food is not good – the guests will think poorly of the venue. This will result  
in poor perception, bad reviews, ill word-of-mouth, less repeat business and harm  
to winning new business.  
This is why the venue event manager cannot allow any element to be wrong. They  
must know what is going to happen. They must know who is supplying what.  
And, they must provide guidance and support to their clients. Chapter 12  
# Winning business and  
# retaining clients  
A venue is in the business of attracting clients.  
So, it must approach marketing from the client’s point of view.  
There are two ways of looking at this\:  
1 How will a client find the venue – reactive marketing.  
2  
How will the venue find a client – proactive marketing.  
12.1 Reactive marketing  
The traditional methods of reaching prospect clients – methods such as the venue  
website and venue brochure, and appearing in venue directories – are reactive  
marketing tools, whereby the venue has already produced a website, a brochure  
or a directory listing and is going to no more effort to attract a client. The client,  
therefore, is doing the work and is active in looking at the website, obtaining the  
brochure or searching through venue directories.  
With reactive marketing methods there is no personal contact between the venue  
and the potential client. This means that the venue must take care to provide  
clear, concise and comprehensive information for potential clients. 92 The management of event venues  
The client in this situation is not asking questions but searching for answers,  
such as the venue’s location, its style, its suitability for their event, the capacity of  
its spaces and what technical equipment is in situ.  
With reactive marketing, a venue must anticipate answers to unasked  
questions.  
If the information provided by the venue is not clear, concise and comprehensive,  
or is misleading, then the client will proceed to the next website, venue brochure  
or directory listing. This is their choice and there is nothing a venue can do about  
it. They will not even know about it.  
So, a venue can lose potential clients quicker and easier than gaining them.  
Choice is abundant – as previously discussed, events are happening in all manner  
of venues so a client has a wide range from which to choose. This is especially  
true where the event brief is flexible with location.  
Clients – particularly event organisers and venue finders – are looking for reasons  
to eliminate venues from their wide search. This is the most effective way of nar-  
rowing a mass of choice. But, the elimination must be quick. A venue searcher  
will not stop to decipher information; they will not take time to search for what  
they need; they will not take time to wade through text … They want a quick ‘yes’  
or ‘no’ as to the venue’s suitability for their event.  
The easiest and most efficient information to understand a venue’s suitability  
is its capacity. This needs to be the upfront tell-tale statistic for every venue to  
reveal. If it is too small to host the anticipated number of guests, it can be elimi-  
nated from the search.  
Some venues may hide their capacity and bury it somewhere in the brochure or  
website. Some do not reveal their capacity at all. They believe that all enquiries  
are welcome. However, it is a clear signal of unprofessionalism if that most vital  
statistic is missing or not obvious. A professional and experienced venue will un-  
derstand the need for a searcher to see this information immediately. If the venue  
is not big enough, it is not big enough! What is the secret?  
For this reason, many event organisers will move on to the next venue in their  
search if the capacity is not immediately visible.  
It can be seen, therefore, that it is a mistaken belief to think all enquiries are  
welcome because a proportion of enquiries will not bother to bring their enquiry  
to the venue if the information is not clear and evident. How is a venue going to  
measure how many enquiries they did not get because of this? Winning business and retaining CLients 93  
Ironically, it is exactly the type of enquiries a venue wants that they will not get –  
the professional event organisers and venue searchers.  
Note\: Venues must show the capacity for each space or room in the venue, and  
in different formats such as how many can be accommodated for a standing re-  
ception; a sit-down banquet; with theatre-style rows of seats; a buffet; dancing;  
overnight accommodation.  
This capacity information is what a venue searcher needs to land on. They would  
prefer to reject a venue because it is too small, rather than having to waste effort  
and time to find out it is too small.  
Author’s voice box  
I was looking at the website of a venue where I had previously held an  
event. I noticed their capacity was 500 guests. But the event I had held  
there was for 800 guests.  
This confused me, so I retrieved the venue’s brochure from my archives  
to cross-reference it with the venue website and see what had changed.  
The venue brochure only made matters worse\: there were no capacity  
details printed within the brochure.  
After a while, I worked out that the website had listed the *seated* ca-  
pacity for a presentation as 500, whereas my event had been a *standing*  
event for 800.  
The problem is that a potential client looking at that venue’s website  
would quickly dismiss the venue for being too small if its total capacity  
was 500. This means that the venue could lose a decent-sized event  
and a valuable client – and how would they know how many clients had  
made the same judgement?  
Some venues deliberately hide pertinent information, such as charges and capac-  
ities. With charges, it may be understood that sales packages vary, and venues  
like to discuss the details of each enquiry before presenting a quote. Still, there  
should be a price guide so that the venue searcher can rule the venue in or out.  
It is better for a venue not to hide facts from searchers\: they’ll be discovered  
sooner or later. 94 The management of event venues  
The capacity of a venue should never be hidden. A venue may believe they are  
generating inbound business by ‘forcing’ the client to make an enquiry about how  
many people the venue can accommodate. But, venue searchers and clients do not  
work that way. If they cannot find the information they need, they will proceed  
to the next venue in the listing. This is understanding how clients find venues.  
Searching for a venue is a time-consuming \(and often boring\) activity. A client  
will be looking for ease and speed while they carry out this task. It is far easier  
and quicker to move on to the next venue than to spend time making individual  
enquiries about basic information.  
If a venue does not impart basic information, an experienced searcher will find  
it frustrating, unprofessional and even suspicious. They will move on to the next  
venue.  
So, if a venue is hoping to attract good-quality clients, high budgets, high-profile  
events and the like, it will dissuade those professionals who handle such top  
events, because the basic information for the venue was not readily available.  
In many cases, event organisers delegate the arduous job of venue searching to  
junior staff. A venue should not expect a junior to bother with venues that make  
their task more challenging or time-consuming.  
With reactive marketing, where the client is doing the research and the venue  
has no contact with the client, it is important to convey the following necessary  
information.  
• Lowest and highest capacity  
‘We can accommodate events for between 40 and 800 guests’ is the way to  
show that there are small rooms \(40 guests\) as well as the overall total venue  
capacity \(800 guests\). It demonstrates a versatility and range of possibilities  
at this venue. It also allows flexibility for a client should the attendance num-  
bers increase or decrease.  
If there is only one room; a ballroom, say, then the minimum comfortable  
number should be shown, i.e. 500–800 guests. It would be misleading to  
show the minimum comfortable number as 200 if the venue would look half-  
empty with this number.  
Often, a venue will list individual rooms with their maximum capacity.  
Garden Suite 220 guests  
Velvet Suite 80 guests  
Red Room 50 guests Winning business and retaining CLients 95  
Or, a venue may list the layout options of each space, such as\:  
Grand Ballroom  
Reception 500  
Presentation without stage 400  
Presentation with stage 300  
Dinner 200  
Dinner and dance 150  
• Good-quality images of the décor, ambience and style of venue  
A professional venue searcher will be making decisions on suitable venues  
to propose for their client’s event. It will help if they can make judgements  
according to style, décor and architecture and whether these fit the brief.  
Where a client is selecting a venue they are making professional, practical  
and personal decisions.  
• Professional\: the venue must suit the type of event and the company’s pro-  
file. A murder-mystery event would suit a country house, for example.  
• Practical\: the client needs to ensure that the venue is the right size, is in the  
right location, has the right facilities, and has good service and quality staff.  
• Personal\: the client will judge the look of the venue and its likeability. They  
will be looking at the quality of pictures, and the ambience, style and atmos-  
phere of the venue. They will see the cleanliness. And, they will be influ-  
enced by their interactions with the management and staff.  
• Clearly, if the client does not like the look or feel of a venue, they will not  
choose to book it.  
• Good-quality images of a range of types of events previously held at the venue  
If there are pictures of other events at the venue, such as a presentation;  
fashion show; party; or product launch, it will convey to potential clients that  
the venue is experienced in hosting a range of events and that it is versatile.  
This will also demonstrate that this venue is suitable for their type of event  
and how it might look at that venue.  
• Technical specification  
A ‘tech-spec’ should be listed for items that are available in situ.  
It does not matter whether these carry additional charges. The purpose is to  
indicate to potential clients the facilities and services that are available. If there  
are good technical facilities, such as sound, lighting and projection, it suggests  
the venue is an experienced and well-equipped professional events venue. 96 The management of event venues  
Sometimes, the technical requirements form the brief and a venue searcher will  
be looking for technical abilities as much as capacity, price or style of venue.  
• Directions and/or map  
• Direct contact details to the venue events manager \(not reception; not the  
sales manager\)  
12.2 Proactive marketing  
Proactive marketing methods are ones where the venue is actively seeking clients  
and is reaching out to make contact with them. Such activities could include at-  
tending venue exhibitions and trade fairs.  
Author’s voice box  
When I joined the London Hippodrome as their events manager, I  
knew that I needed to get the venue known in the corporate events  
marketplace.  
The problem was that the venue had only been promoting what every-  
body already knew\: that it was a West End nightclub.  
I needed to show what *wasn’t* known about the Hippodrome\: that it  
could be a fantastic venue for events.  
I repositioned the profile of the venue away from the obvious and  
shifted the emphasis of marketing to its capacity and location – it could  
accommodate 1,300 seated guests in a central London location on the  
corner of Leicester Square above the Tube station. I also promoted its  
amazing technical features, such as the hydraulic stage, the incredible  
versatile lighting rig, massive sound, and its tiered balconies.  
I spent some time gathering images of events at the venue to demon-  
strate the range and ability, and then produced a brochure in keeping  
with the corporate market, showing information relevant to clients and  
venue searchers.  
I presented the venue with the new brochure, exciting pictures of events,  
and a corporate show-reel of previous events at a venue exhibition.  
Visitors to the exhibition were surprised that the Hippodrome ‘night-  
club’ was being represented as a corporate events venue and it was this  
surprise that drew their interest... and their business. Winning business and retaining CLients 97  
As well as taking a venue out to exhibitions, there is the opportunity to invite  
potential clients in to the venue for promotion evenings \(sometimes referred to  
as booker’s evenings\).  
Promotion evenings draw targeted potential clients into the venue to see the facilities  
first-hand and experience the services and facilities for themselves. It also provides  
excellent networking for businesspeople. And, of course, it allows the venue events  
manager to meet potential clients and begin all-important client relationships.  
The idea of a promotion evening is to entertain clients as if they were guests at an  
event. That is exactly what they are, in fact. They should experience the welcome  
procedure, badge procedure, bars and catering – just like a ‘true’ guest would.  
This is why the promotion evening should be treated as an event, itself. Although  
this event is arranged internally and the ‘client’ is the venue manager, a promo-  
tion evening cannot be approached as anything less than the highest standard  
of event. It needs to demonstrate the absolute best of the venue’s capabilities to  
clients who have the means to book the venue for their event or recommend it for  
their client’s events.  
A promotion evening will not reach its objective of securing future events busi-  
ness if it is treated as internal, or routine, or a no-budget event.  
The venue’s event manager must plan every detail of a promotion evening using  
the same exacting procedures for any event. The difference here is that the events  
manager is their own client – but no less important than any client.  
Crucially, nothing should go wrong in the venue on the night it is being shown  
to potential bookers.  
The venue’s sales team, venue management team and venue event manager will  
be on hand to meet the potential clients attending the promotion evening.  
The arrival and reception procedures must be adhered to, as must the quality of  
service and catering. There must be a staff briefing before the doors open. There  
must be a rehearsal …  
Usually, clients would be shown around the venue to see the facilities, backstage  
areas, dressing rooms, kitchens and technical apparatus.  
Because there would be a range of bookers with different needs, a ‘live brochure’  
show can be presented to show a brief fashion show, a dinner set-up, a conference  
set-up with presentation, a live band for entertainment. This will demonstrate the  
versatility and capability of the venue, its technical crew and its management team. 98 The management of event venues  
Author’s voice box  
I know of many venues which carry out daytime or weekend wedding  
fairs. These can be successful because they attract the interest of a di-  
rect target market.  
However, a venue should always aim to meet the interest of a range of  
potential clients.  
Even if it is a wedding fair as the main showcase, the venue could also  
promote parties, the bar, the restaurant, accommodation, conference  
space, and whatever else is available.  
My point is that a wedding fair seems a lot of trouble to go to for just  
one segment of the events market. Surely, the day should be open to  
other potential segments. Maybe one of the bride’s parents will need a  
conference space in the future, or the bride/groom works for a company  
which will be looking for a Christmas party.  
It could even happen that the bride and groom don’t choose the venue  
for their wedding, but would like to book it for a dinner or overnight  
stay.  
I fail to understand why a venue would wish to attract just wedding  
clients on any particular day when it should be an Open Day for all po-  
tential clients to view the venue.  
Remember also to provide examples of what the venue can offer. If it is  
a wedding fair, why not offer a cocktail at the bar to relax the guests and  
help them feel familiar with the environment; or a special reduced-price  
brunch menu so that they can sample the cuisine?  
Versatility is the name of the game here.  
12.3 Winning events business  
The art of winning business into a venue is not down to just one thing. It is a  
combination of procedures which make the whole and drive the client to reach  
a positive decision and book the venue for their event. Many of the procedures  
are outlined in this book\: the enquiry-handling procedure \(Chapter 15\); the one-person  
management structure \(Chapter 9\); the show-round procedure \(­ Chapter 6,  
section 6.2 and Chapter 16\); and others, too.  
Clients respond to trust. Trust is demonstrated by professionalism. Winning business and retaining CLients 99  
A client needs to feel that their event is placed in the safe hands of the venue  
of their choice. If a client does not feel this – if the professionalism is not  
there – they will not book the venue because they will not trust their event  
to be safe.  
It must be remembered that the client’s reputation is at stake to their boss; their  
colleagues; their friends … A client will not risk their job, their standing, and  
their reputation.  
12.4 Tendering  
A venue may tender for business. This is where it competes against rival venues  
for a particular event, a series of events, or a corporation’s events.  
So, instead of a client placing an enquiry at a venue and then booking a show-  
round to reach their decision, the process is lengthened by inviting a range of  
like-for-like venues to tender for the business.  
12.4.1 Request for information  
A corporation may issue a Request for Information \(RFI\) to an event manage-  
ment company to receive information about their capabilities as a supplier of  
event management expertise.  
The RFI would usually be in a standard format so as to compare suppliers of the  
same or similar services.  
Similarly, an event management company with a contract to organise a large-  
scale event or series of events may begin scouting for venues and issue an RFI to  
identify potential venues to ascertain their suitability and viability – and perhaps  
their financial stability, also.  
Contents of an RFI are as follows\:  
• introduction  
• abstract  
• company/venue profile, structure, senior team biographies  
• membership of associations, professional bodies, quality assurances  
• financial status  
• insurances  
• client portfolio, testimonials, case histories. 100 The management of event venues  
12.4.2 Request for proposal  
Once a corporation has received and appraised an RFI, or if it is an event man-  
agement company appraising an RFI from venues, it may issue a Request for  
Proposal \(RFP\).  
The difference between an RFI and an RFP is that the former is a request for  
information\: it is generic and would look at the viability, so it is more about the  
company; whereas the latter is a request for a proposal to be written\: it is specific  
and would look at the detail, so it is more about the suitability.  
When a venue receives an RFP from a client or event company, it should approach  
it in the same manner as all enquiries, except it may have to be presented in the  
client’s format rather than the venue’s preferred format.  
Contents of an RFP are as follows\:  
• senior team biographies  
• synopsis of the brief, including event objectives  
• dates and event timeline, outline of schedule, gantt chart from the lead-in to  
the day of the event  
• requirements\: technical, theme, branding, staffing  
• venue rationale and supporting statements  
• transportation logistics  
• budget  
• risk assessment plan  
• post-event evaluation methods.  
12.5 Pitching  
A venue may be invited to pitch for an event, and this could follow an RFI or RFP.  
Pitching is a competitive process and would indicate that other venues are being  
considered to host the event.  
A pitch is a sales presentation and needs to be treated as such.  
It needs to be professional, rehearsed and delivered with creativity using  
visual aids such as PowerPoint, mood boards, video, brochures, photos, artist  
impressions. Winning business and retaining CLients 101  
As with any presentation, a pitch must be professional, time-conscious, relevant,  
succinct, honest, creative, engaging and memorable. The core message must be  
sent by the presenter and received by the audience.  
Whoever is tasked with delivering the pitch to a potential client should be a  
confident presenter and speaker, and trained in the structure and delivery of  
presentations.  
Any presentation must be rehearsed – and delivering a pitch presentation to a  
client to win their event requires and deserves rehearsing. An experienced client  
will immediately detect whether a pitch presentation has not been rehearsed.  
Even if the presentation is delivered by a sole presenter and not a team, it must  
be rehearsed.  
Pitching for business is an event in itself. The presentation team must consider  
how the group dynamics will work.  
• Who will open the presentation – who is the confident speaker to get the  
presentation flowing?  
• Who will deliver which segments of the presentation – who has the specialist  
knowledge and expertise of each subject area or department?  
• Who will close the presentation\: to summarise and conclude?  
• Who will ask questions to the client?  
• Who will answer questions from the client?  
Pitching is competitive so there will be other venues pitching for the same piece  
of business. The same is true when delivering a proposal to a client\: other venues  
will be submitting proposals too.  
Care must be taken not to reveal who are the suppliers and providers. Perhaps  
at a later stage when the booking has been confirmed it may become necessary  
to disclose which supplier is providing an item for the event. But, at the early  
stages it would be foolhardy to furnish a prospective client with a list of valued  
and trusted suppliers – what’s to stop that client from contacting the suppliers  
direct? Or getting in touch with them to discuss prices? Or if the client chooses  
an alternative venue, what’s to stop them selecting elements of your proposal and  
handing it to the competitor venue with the ready-made list of suppliers?  
Venue managers should protect access to their suppliers and not allow clients or  
alternative venues access to the source. 102 The management of event venues  
Author’s voice box  
In event proposals, I frequently see a list of elements to enhance the  
event, and alongside each element will be the name of the supplier.  
Why?  
I suppose it is information presented in openness and good faith. But  
it is a mistake.  
Clients do not need to know where elements are sourced from – especially  
at the early stages before confirmation when a client could choose another  
venue and hand them the list of suppliers.  
This is particularly risky with creative elements which another venue may  
not have thought of or know where to source them.  
It can also happen when the competitor venue’s prices are higher and  
the client uses the first venue’s prices as leverage – and tells them where  
to get it from.  
12.6 Repeat business  
Retaining clients and gaining loyalty to achieve repeat business is surprisingly  
simple to do. It simply involves two crucial factors which have already been iden-  
tified and discussed in this book\:  
• Likeability.  
• Professionalism.  
Getting these two elements right ensures that the client will want to come back.  
For one thing, they have already enjoyed an experience at the venue, and it was  
successful too. What else could a client wish for?  
Clients want ease and they want trust. It is easier for them to repeat an enjoyable  
and successful event than to have to find another place to do it. It would mean  
them beginning from scratch – finding a venue; negotiating with the venue; cre-  
ating and building client/venue relationships; building trust … It has to be far  
easier for a client to go where this has been done already. So long as it was like-  
able and professional.  
The main influence for clients to repeat their event at a venue, or to bring a further  
different event to that venue, is the success of their previous event at that venue. Winning business and retaining CLients 103  
However, the client relationship is the secondary influence and is no less  
important.  
Clients will repeat their business at venues where they are confident of success  
and where they enjoy working alongside the people there.  
Aside from doing the job well, being professional, being personable, and meeting  
the needs and demands of clients, a venue can employ further tactics to encour-  
age repeat business\:  
12.6.1 Longer-term contracts  
When seeking to retain clients and secure their repeat business it is a good tactic  
to tie them in with two- or three-year contracts.  
Longer-term contracts work especially well with annual events, where the client  
is confident the event will happen the following year and perhaps the year after  
that.  
It is not usual for a client to sign a contract that is longer than three years be-  
cause they will understand the risk of their event becoming stale. Also, company  
strategies change and the event may not occur in a few years’ time, or could take  
a different direction which requires an alternative venue.  
The exception would be where there is a lack of suitable venues in the locality and  
the client would need to secure the venue for five or more years. Or, where the  
event is synonymous with the venue, such as The Proms at the Royal Albert Hall,  
or the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium.  
The benefit to the client with a two- or three-year contract is that they have se-  
cured a venue and do not need to repeat the time-consuming venue search each  
year. Even if they were to rebook the same venue on a yearly contract basis, they  
would still need to go through the booking and negotiation processes.  
Also, the client would receive a favourable venue hire fee for their longer-term  
commitment. Typically, this might be a 10% discount in Year One; 20% discount  
in Year Two; and 50% discount in Year Three. Discount terms vary from venue  
to venue.  
An additional benefit for clients with longer-term contracts is that lessons have  
been learned from the previous year, so the subsequent years will be easier to  
plan. The client, event suppliers and the venue management team develop a  
working relationship over time and become a team, while each will understand  
the idiosyncrasies of the event being held at that venue. 104 The management of event venues  
From the venue point of view, offering good terms for longer-term contracts is a  
way of optimising business. It has already been stated in this book that events  
are closely related to hotels. With a hotel the emphasis is on occupancy levels;  
that is, the percentage of bedrooms sold against the amount of rooms available  
to sell and the number of days in a year. This makes hotel bedrooms a perishable  
commodity because they expire with time.  
It is the same with an events venue. The space\(s\) available to hire for an event are  
available for a known number of days per year. For every day that a space is not  
booked it is not generating revenue. This makes events space perishable because  
it cannot be sold on a date that has passed and so the revenue opportunity has  
expired.  
Knowing the levels of event bookings well in advance allows the sales manager  
or venue manager to measure the level of booked business and set targets for ad-  
vance bookings. These targets should become Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\)  
in that they provide a measurement of performance of the business. In this case  
it would be the performance of advanced bookings.  
The manager can then optimise occupancy by initiating sales drives and discounts  
in advance of the low-occupancy periods – before they occur, in other words.  
So, in the business of limiting the risk of expired dates with no event bookings, it  
works for venues to commit their clients to longer-term contracts. Chapter 13  
# Budgeting for events  
Contribution from Adrian Martin  
Creating a budget for an event is probably the most important action an event  
organiser or venue manager will undertake. The budget is essential to the overall  
success of an event and is an important part of not just controlling an event, but  
deciding whether to go ahead with it in the first place.  
Budgets are important because they have the power to control costs, motivate  
staff to achieve revenue targets, and inform managers on the viability of an event  
prior to any work taking place.  
This chapter will explain where budgets come from, how they are developed and  
created, as well as some simple calculus that will help determine whether they are  
achievable or not.  
Budgeting can be a bit like looking into a crystal ball\: there are no rights or wrongs  
at the time of creation as nobody can see the future.  
Having said that, experience and practice of budget-writing will begin to identify  
unrealistic predictions of revenue and spend, the ability to predict and work to  
realistic profit margins. 106 the management of event venues  
13.1 Where budgets come from  
The simple answer to this question is that they come from whomever is ultimately  
in charge of the company, normally the CEO or the owner. Their job is to look at  
external influences on the company as well as past performances and internal  
data, and set targets and objectives for the following year. At this stage the finan-  
cial director or equivalent will turn the financial objectives into a company-wide  
budget.  
For instance an event company that has an overall net profit target of £3 million  
would start to disseminate this throughout the organisation. If the company  
had three event venues the temptation would be to split the target equally\:  
£1 million per venue. However it is highly unlikely that each venue is either  
the same size, has the same costs or the same local market dynamics. At this  
stage decisions need to be made by looking at the historical performance of  
each venue.

2017 profit 650,000 1,090,000 850,000 2,590,000  
There are a number of conclusions to be drawn from the above table.  
Overall profits are rising by 2.5% between 2015 and 2016 \(£60,000 extra profit  
/ £2,440,000 year prior’s profit × 100\) and by 3.6% between 2016 and 2017  
\(£90,000 extra profit / £2,500,000 year prior’s profit × 100\).

Although profits are rising, a further increase of say 5% would only give a result  
of \(£2,590,000 × 1.05\) £2,7195,000 and so the £3 million target from the owner is  
a real challenge for the company at 15.8% \(£3,000,000 target – £2,590,000 last  
year’s result / £2,590,000 × 100\). Budgeting for events 107

There is a decision to make now and it is a judgement call\: should the £3m target  
between the three venues be carved up in the same proportion as above?

The issue with this is that each of the venues is showing different trends and it  
would be difficult for Venue 2 for instance, to reverse a declining profit and sud-  
denly raise profits by £170,000. Whereas for Venue 3 it might be too easy to raise  
profits by a similar amount to the year before.  
This is where local and internal knowledge can help create a much fairer  
budget.  
If, for instance, Venue 2 has a new competitor in the area and is losing business  
through no fault of their own, this could be taken in to account. If Venue 3 had  
recently been refurbished and was closed for a month last year, it could expect a  
whole month’s additional revenue this year, in addition to the return from having  
the attraction of a newly renovated venue.  
Working with the managers of the venues and using any data available both lo-  
cally and industry-wide, as well as possible economic forecasting, will allow the  
adjustment of these targets to make them achievable as well as motivational.  
A budget which is impossible to achieve can be damaging to morale and cause  
stress and loss of staff. A budget which is too easy to achieve can create compla-  
cency and overspending.  
What tends to happen now is a meeting with the managers of each venue to  
explain the overall target the company has been given and negotiate with each  
manager to ascertain a ‘stretch’ target for each venue. Budgeting for events 109

Each venue may feel hard done by, and this is often the case in business. But,  
none would feel the budget is impossible to achieve and all will feel motivated to  
help the company achieve its overall target.  
13.2 How to create a budget  
Now that each venue has its overall profit target for the next year, an overall  
budget can be created for every revenue stream and cost.  
Most budget planners start this process by looking at previous years’ expenditure  
and income to get a picture of past performance.

Net profit 650,000 675,000  
The budget and the actual results from the year before helps the budget planner  
to paint a picture of the venue’s actual versus predicted performance.  
They will be able to see that on the comparison of most costs and revenue streams  
the performance was close to the budget. Some lines, however, highlight short-  
falls and this is where the venue manager should focus their attention.  
For instance, there is a shortfall in venue hire and food income in the first section  
and by extension an overall shortfall in total revenue of £32,000. If the venue is less  
busy than was predicted, then logically the costs in the second section will also be  
lower and in this case they are but only by £23,000. Looking at the third section it  
can be seen that these costs are easier to predict \(property taxes, for instance, are  
given a year in advance sometimes\). However, it can be seen that equipment costs  
went significantly over-budget \(by £87,000\) and yet payroll was under-budget, as  
was advertising \(maybe a reason why the venue did not hit its revenue target\).  
The budget planner can now rewrite the budget using the new overall target of  
£750,000 which is a 15.3% rise on the result of last year. A simple place to start would  
be to add 15.3% to all of the revenues and costs from the actual result from last year.  
As long as the venue was profitable this will increase total revenue by 15.3% as well  
as costs by 15.3% meaning the difference \(profit\) will also rise by 15.3%. Budgeting for events 111

13.3 How budgets are developed  
Creating a budget by simply adding an overall percentage rise is very basic, how-  
ever, and it has already been identified which areas the venue manager needs to  
look at \(advertising, for instance\).  
It is also known that some of the costs are easy to predict and will not actually rise  
by that amount at all \(property taxes and interest rates, for instance\).  
By using internal and local knowledge as well as national data on minimum wage  
rises, for instance, the budget planner can start to adjust some of the costs in line  
with more accurate predictions. It may be decided to increase some of the costs  
in places \(advertising\) to justify a rise in revenue elsewhere.

Reducing these inflated costs to a more reasonable level allows the budget to  
predict too much profit of £816,152. Effectively, it can be decided to either raise  
budgeted costs or reduce revenue targets by the difference, £66,152. By doing  
this the budget becomes more achievable, but is it really possible to raise revenue  
by 15.3% in one year?

Now that there is an overall venue budget achieved, the budget planner can begin  
to narrow the budget to individual events.  
Again there are a number of ways of doing this but most event venues will make  
a prediction of the number of events they will host over the year. They will then  
apportion the costs above per event.

Assuming the venue has multiple rooms and predicts they will host 2,000 event  
hires per year, each cost has been divided by 2,000 so that each event contributes  
to the overall costs of the venue.  
The sales team can then calculate the profit of any enquiry to make a judgement  
on whether it is on- or off-budget.  
For instance, a wedding with 100 guests paying £35pp \(per person\) with an antic-  
ipated spend of £20pp in the bar with a room hire of £1,000 would look like this.

Some venues will set a minimum profit to prevent low-margin events taking place.  
The event in this given example is generating over £2,000 profit and so would  
probably go ahead.  
However a small hire with no food or drink – a day-meeting, perhaps – might  
only raise £100. The question needs to be asked whether accepting this booking  
would turn away another better booking. If this is not the case \(maybe because  
the date is close\) are there any variable costs to this booking? If not, then com-  
mon sense can apply and the booking would go ahead. 118 The management of event venues  
There can be many flaws with a budgeting process and at times it can inhibit and  
exasperate venue managers. It does, however, provide senior management with  
a level of control and comfort that the organisation as a whole is progressing to  
targets. As has already been identified here, there are times when the rules of  
budgeting can fail and common sense needs to prevail.  
13.5 Venue hire fee  
The amount a venue charges for the hire of their venue is dependent upon a range  
of factors.  
Local market forces are one of the main determinants. If venues in a locality have  
determined their price range, like-for-like venues will benchmark their charges  
against their competitors. This makes sense because a client will search for ven-  
ues in the locality of their event and will arrive at a decision based on a range of  
factors – the main one being price \(usually\).  
However, every venue has its unique selling points \(USPs\), idiosyncrasies, and  
other variables which set it apart from any other venue. These differences may  
determine the price point of the hire fee and may even provide justification for  
an elevated hire fee.  
Thus, a venue manager should understand that price is not the only determi-  
nant in setting the hire fee, and benchmarking against competitors is not always  
appropriate.  
Where a venue does consider price as the determinant of setting the hire fee to  
win event business, it will prioritise price over other factors. When this happens  
it can lead to a spiral of price undercutting which itself leads to clients choosing  
the venue because of its low price. Here, the venue USP is its low price, which is  
why clients book it.  
This may attract high-volume low-spend clients in the short term, but the long-  
term reputation of a venue can be harmed because it becomes seen as a low-cost  
or ‘cheap’ venue. Where price is the priority, clients will focus on this aspect over  
service or quality, and this again taints a venue’s reputation.  
The danger here is that high-spend clients will avoid such a venue.  
Additionally, low-spend clients with restricted budgets who are attracted to the  
venue because of its low prices will still negotiate the prices – remember that  
these are the clients who focus on how much they spend, which is why they are  
attracted to the venue. This becomes a target market\: those clients who have Budgeting for events 119  
restricted budgets and the cost of the event is the highest priority rather than  
service, quality or professionalism.  
A venue with such a policy can find itself continually undercutting prices to suit  
the demand of its low-spend clients. This is not sustainable for a business, as  
eventually the profit margins become compromised due to the demands of low-  
spend clientele.  
It is also extremely difficult for a venue to climb out of this situation, having  
created low cost as its USP. It takes a very long time to shed a poor reputation,  
but also the target market of low-spend clients are the most sensitive to price  
increases. Thus, a venue which is forced to increase its prices will meet resistance  
and loss of business from the low-spend marketplace.  
The differences between one venue and another may appear tangible and easily  
identifiable\: style; decoration; architecture; ambience; facilities; capacity; suita-  
bility for the event; name; location; and reputation.  
Other differences may be less identifiable to an inexperienced client\: profession-  
alism, for example.  
Venues offer both a product – the space and its facilities, and a service – client  
handling, service standards, professional event management.  
If event business is not won solely due to price \(which is not sustainable practice,  
as detailed above\) a venue must attract clients through its product offering and  
service offering.  
A successful event venue wins business by first attracting clients through the  
door because of its product and service, and thereafter negotiating the price.  
Location, space, capacity, facilities, reputation, professionalism … these are the  
factors which attract clients. Price should be a secondary element. Chapter 14  
# Guests at venues  
The priority for a guest at an event is to have a good time.  
However, there is a lot more to it than that.  
Events are not always organised for guests to have a fun time or an enjoyable  
time, but they are always about having a good time. Some events may certainly  
be about having a good time – Christmas parties; social days out; concerts. But,  
even where the objective of an event is about serious business or serious causes  
and is not organised for the prime objective of ‘fun’, guests must still have a good  
time; a good experience, let’s say.  
14.1 Personal safety of guests  
Having a good time is one thing, but an event guest has an expectation to be safe.  
At first thought, this may appear obvious. But personal safety is not obvious because  
it is a ‘hidden’ need\: most event guests either forget about their safety, they cannot  
be bothered to think about it at that time, or they rely on others to think about it  
for them and hand this responsibility to the venue, client, event organiser, crew, and  
performers. In short, guests are complacent when it comes to their safety at events.  
In a way, this is not surprising because often the purpose of an event is to allow  
guests to escape from thinking about realities, such as safety. Guests at venues 121  
If the guests are not thinking about their safety, the burden of this responsibility  
has to rest with the event organiser and the venue manager.  
Everybody knows that safety is an important element to think about. Yet, event  
guests rarely do think about it. This is a heightened risk because events are tem-  
porary live happenings and temporary things can get done dangerously.  
• Staff may be working in unfamiliar surroundings – this is especially true  
with agency staff or in a greenfield venue such as a marquee. The staff will  
not know the safety procedures or be aware of specific hazards within the  
venue, such as slippery floor surfaces or trip hazards.  
• Even where staff are familiar with the venue in which they are working, their  
role may change because the event means they must work differently and  
may not follow their usual patterns of behaviour and routine. This causes a  
heightened risk of accidents.  
• Guests at an event are likely to be unfamiliar with their surroundings. They  
will not know the safety procedures or escape routes. And, they certainly will  
not be aware of hazards within the venue, such as unlit steps or trailing cables.  
• When an event occurs in a venue things get changed, things get moved,  
things get covered. It may be that the fire-fighting equipment gets moved, or  
the emergency lighting gets covered by decoration or branding, or an escape  
route gets blocked by deliveries or temporary storage of unused furniture.  
• At most events, elements are installed temporarily, such as lights on tripods  
and projectors flown from ceilings. When fixtures are not permanently in-  
stalled, they create particular hazards of which to be aware, such as cables ly-  
ing across floors, toppling of structures, and tripping over tripod legs. Some  
fixtures may not get securely fixed because of the temporary nature of them  
being there – in a few hours they will be gone.  
• The temporary nature of events leads to the potential of complacency. Be-  
cause the event will be gone within one day in most cases, some organisers  
may adopt the attitude of ‘it doesn’t matter’, or ‘nobody will know’. Even  
where safety regulations exist, unprofessional or unqualified personnel may  
consider it is worth the risk to cut corners because of the very low odds of a  
safety inspector visiting the venue during the event.  
It should be noted that venues which operate in undeveloped events industries  
abroad may not adhere to safety regulations. Indeed, safety regulations for events  
and venues may not exist.  
Everybody also knows not to rely on other people for one’s own safety. Yet, event  
guests seem content to absolve themselves of the responsibility and entrust their  
safety to people they have never met and do not know. 122 The management of event venues  
When led to thinking about it, it appears strange behaviour. After all, one would  
not go to a doctor if that doctor did not have medical qualifications. Yet, people  
attend events all the time not knowing whether the venue has qualified personnel,  
or whether the caterer is qualified, or whether the stage-rigging crew are qualified.  
It appears even odder when considering how doctors work within a heavily regu-  
lated industry, whereas event management is a largely unregulated industry. One  
cannot practise medicine without certifications and qualifications, but a venue  
manager does not need a qualification to run a venue, and neither does a caterer  
need a qualification to cook.  
It begs the question\: who should we trust with personal safety? And why do we?  
It is helpful that the evolution of the events industry in the UK is rapidly evolv-  
ing into a regulated discipline where event organisers, event suppliers and venue  
managers can obtain qualifications in how to manage events.  
Evolvement is always gradual and it is a slow process of change to fully eliminate  
unprofessional and inexperienced practice in the events industry.  
14.2 Risk management  
Students of events management typically dislike the two subject areas of finance  
and risk management. Accounting or insurance are not industries they would  
have chosen to study so perhaps they find it a surprise to have to learn these  
subjects on an events course.  
But financial acumen and an understanding of risk are elements required of an  
events professional, and a student should not want to omit either from their  
knowledge bank.  
Events require funding and budgeting, and they make money. Sometimes, it re-  
quires effort and deft expertise for an event to make money. The balancing of  
costs and expenditure versus income and profit is quite often an art.  
Each event is in fact a small business which requires strategy, planning and fi-  
nancial control.  
Events can also be dangerous.  
A professional in events management will not view safety and risk as a laborious  
chore, but pride themselves with their dedication to risk identification, preven-  
tion of hazards and the elimination of risk.  
The health and safety of others is a prerequisite. Risk never gets overlooked. Guests at venues 123  
Author’s voice box  
At a recent event I organised, a lighting stand was erected to a height  
of 15ft. Three heavy parcan \(stage\) lights were at the top of the stand,  
which was supported by three legs – a tripod stand.  
When conducting my final walk-round of the venue before doors  
opened for guests to enter the building, I identified that the lighting  
stand was a safety risk because it could topple and cause injury. I was  
also concerned that a guest might trip over one of the extended legs  
and knock over the stand.  
I asked the lighting technician to secure the stand with wire to a fixed  
wall mounting, but the technician told me that the stand was stable and  
didn’t need securing.  
Next, I asked a stagehand to secure the lighting stand. He was the sec-  
ond person to inform me these stands were stable and don’t fall over so  
it didn’t need securing.  
I found some wire and secured the stand myself.  
It is never right to say ‘it has never happened before’. This does not  
eliminate risk.  
The issue here is that I had identified a risk – and it may have been a  
minimal risk – but all risk must be eliminated.  
It is never worth risking the wellbeing of anybody at an event.  
The venue manager must identify the risks in all cases regardless of whether an  
event of a similar nature has taken place before. Something may have changed. It  
could be a change in theme or decoration – using naked-flame candles instead of  
battery tea-lights, for example. Or, the risk could be a different menu; it could be  
the different profile of guests; it could be the change in staff at the venue. So, risk  
identification is not a one-time exercise, but should form part of the procedures  
of each event.  
14.2.1 Risk assessment  
A risk assessment must be undertaken for each event. The purpose of conducting  
this procedure is to identify any hazards, their likelihood to occur, their potential  
to cause harm, what level of harm, and what measures need to be put in place to  
minimise or eliminate those identified risks. 124 The management of event venues  
In situations where the venue is a green-field space or is being attended by the  
public \(such as a music festival\) the local authority and police will require a risk  
assessment to be undertaken and submitted before they will consider granting  
permission for the event to go ahead.  
In some cases an inspector will visit the site to ensure that risk assessment prac-  
tices are being upheld.  
Insurance underwriters will also require an event risk assessment as a condition  
of insuring an event.  
However, even if there is no statutory requirement to conduct a risk assessment,  
most professional venue managers and event organisers will do so as part of their  
standard operating procedures.  
14.3 Common mistakes of venues  
Some venues are so keen to do things the ‘proper’ way for their guests, they actu-  
ally provide the guest with a bad experience.  
Otherwise, it will be poor management, or that the management simply do not  
care about the comfort and safety of their guests.  
Here are seven common mistakes that venues make\:  
14.3.1 Welcome drinks  
Venues mistakenly believe they need to offer welcome drinks as soon as a guest  
sets foot inside the premises.  
On many occasions, the guest enters through the front door and is confronted  
with a line of waiters offering welcome drinks on a laden tray. This practice is  
nonsense.  
The problem is twofold. First, it is physically difficult for a waiter to stand  
with a tray of filled glasses. Unfortunate waiters will not even realise their  
arms have given way until they hear the clatter of breaking glass and are  
engulfed with embarrassment. It is also wasteful of drinks product and  
glassware.  
Second, the front door is always a very busy and confusing place. Guests are  
hurrying to enter – usually within a short time-frame, so it happens all at once.  
At the front door there are many activities in this confined space\: queues at the Guests at venues 125  
cloakroom; press taking photographs of celebrity arrivals, and non-celebrity  
guests standing to watch; tickets being checked; wristbands and lanyards being  
checked; guest lists being checked; security is present... and on top of all this  
frenzied activity at the front door, guests are presented with a range of drinks to  
choose from.  
Most often, guests will linger at the drinks service point and meet acquaintances  
who are entering the venue at the same time. Very quickly, the entrance becomes  
clogged.  
Then, staff will be cajoling guests to move from the doors and into the venue\: this  
is not giving guests a good experience!  
It is far better venue management to position the waiters well away from the front  
door so as to encourage guests deeper into the venue. Then, as the venue begins  
to fill, the waiters can move forward towards the front door – waiters have legs;  
they are mobile.  
It can be a good idea to have a table with poured drinks behind the waiters, so  
that if a queue forms, guests can take drinks from the table – it speeds the service  
and guests are not forced to wait in line. The waiter should have just a few glasses  
on the tray as a courtesy to offer guests.  
Just these simple adjustments to the practice of offering welcome drinks will  
ensure the smooth entry of guests into a venue, increase the service speed and  
provide a better experience for guests.  
14.3.2 Opening the doors  
Another fallacy for venues is that the doors must open on time.  
If the event is scheduled to begin at 18\:00, say, the venue will rightly wish  
to open the doors on time. But, in the interests of safety, the venue manager  
should conduct a final walk-round prior to allowing the doors to open and  
guests enter the venue. If this final walk-round delays the opening of the  
doors, so be it.  
When everything is in place and the staff briefing has already taken place, and  
the doors are now ready to open, this is when the final walk-round takes place. It  
must be at this point because it is the time when everything should be ready, the  
venue will be in the correct lighting mode and hazards may now present them-  
selves in low light, and this is when to identify last-minute problems that need to  
be resolved before guests enter the venue. 126 The management of event venues  
The purpose of the final walk-round is safety.  
Typical issues found during a final walk-round include the cleaner’s cupboard left  
open or unlocked; cleaning materials and chemicals left behind; areas that need  
tidying or cleaning; blocked fire-escape routes; locked or chained fire exits which,  
by law, must be unlocked before guests enter the venue; missing fire-fighting  
equipment; trip hazards such as loose cables – which may not be obvious during  
the set-up when clearly visible in normal lighting. But at this last-minute stage  
when the lights are in ready-mode, the venue manager may identify cables and  
other trip hazards such as stage edges and treads \(steps to access the stage\) are  
now not clearly visible.  
It is not a problem to open the doors a few minutes late. Better this  
than allowing guests to enter a venue which has not been finally checked for  
safety.  
Besides, it is not ideal to let the first eager guests in on time and let them witness  
a flurry of preparation, or they enter a venue that is not fully ready, or the staff  
are not in place.  
The venue manager should always make an announcement to the staff that the  
doors are about to open. It is most unprofessional \(but happens often\) for guests  
to enter a venue and the staff are unaware the doors have opened.  
Author’s voice box  
I find it helpful to delay the opening of the doors at an event.  
I try not to allow the first prompt and eager guests to wander into an  
empty venue with no atmosphere.  
I would rather keep guests outside the venue for a few minutes until  
there is a small crowd. It builds their anticipation. Then, when the doors  
do open, there is a surge of energy into the venue and the atmosphere  
is there from the outset.  
Opening the doors late can work to a venue’s advantage. It generates  
a frisson of excitement and buzz outside the closed doors. Guests will  
gather and it will build their curiosity. If the doors open on time and just  
the prompt or early guests mill around in an empty venue, there is no  
‘buzz’. Guests at venues 127  
14.3.3 Buffet service  
There seems to be little error with serving canapés, sit-down dinners or ban-  
quets. But, when it comes to buffets, many venues make the same mistakes.  
A buffet should never be placed against a wall. To do so creates one dead side. It is  
far more efficient for guests if they can access the buffet from both sides.  
Even where guests will approach the buffet from just one side, the buffet table  
should be away from the wall to allow access for staff. This way the buffet can be  
replenished without staff having to barge through guests at the buffet. Besides,  
a staff member should always be behind the buffet to assist with menu queries,  
allergen questions, maintain portion control, and to help serve so as to add speed  
to the flow of guests at the buffet.  
There is a safety aspect here, also. A staff member should be behind the buffet  
to prevent children from reaching hot dishes. This is especially pertinent at wed-  
dings where there are children present. Usually at weddings the evening buffet  
will consist of dishes heated by naked flame burners under chafing dishes with  
hot water. Staff behind the buffet should be aware of this risk.  
There is no reason why a buffet table should ever be placed hard against a wall.  
Buffets are notorious for creating queues. Nobody likes to stand in a queue and wait  
for their food. If possible, there should be more than one buffet point to distribute  
the flow of guests. At least, the desserts should be on a separate buffet table.  
Plates, cutlery, condiments and napkins should be on a separate table from the  
buffet.  
Creating satellite stations for the desserts or the plates and cutlery will disperse  
guests and alleviate queuing.  
Many venues prepare a buffet table and feel their responsibility ends there. But,  
staff should constantly replenish dishes and exchange half-empty dishes for full.  
Once a dish is half empty, it should be returned to the kitchen for replenishment.  
Keeping room behind the buffet for staff access will encourage replenishment by  
making it easier for staff and less intrusive to guests.  
Each guest who visits the buffet at any time of their choosing during an event  
should receive a first-class experience. If the buffet is looking tired it should be  
closed and returned to the kitchen. 128 The management of event venues  
14.3.4 Cloakroom  
Cloakrooms are frequently a problem, which is a surprise considering that the  
venue manager knows when the cloakroom will be used \(when it is cold or wet\)  
and when it will be busy \(at the beginning and end of every event\).  
Frequently, cloakrooms in venues are understaffed and in the wrong place. It  
seems cloakrooms are treated as a low priority, probably because they do not  
make money for the venue – the client is not paying for the cloakroom and neither  
are guests in most cases.  
Yet, when it comes to guest experience, guests use the cloakroom when they enter  
and when they leave a venue – so it is their first and last impression of that venue.  
Also, the venue’s duty of caretaking for their guests’ beloved possessions, such  
as expensive coats, cashmere scarves, briefcases, umbrellas and hats is a serious  
responsibility.  
If the cloakroom is temporary for the event, it should be sited near to the front  
door but not at the front door. If queues form at the cloakroom, it blocks the en-  
trance to the venue and forces guests to queue outside.  
There is no rule which states a cloakroom must be at the front door. Yes, it  
makes sense because a guest wishes to deposit their belongings as soon as  
possible, and will wish to collect them again when they are leaving. But, there  
are many venues which have cloakrooms at the back of the premises or even in  
the basement. As long as the cloakroom is signposted and easy to find, it can  
be located anywhere.  
Fixed cloakrooms cannot be moved \(although a satellite cloakroom can be set  
up for larger attendance\), but the location of temporary cloakrooms needs to  
be planned. Remember, the front door is a busy environment with arrivals,  
departures, press, security … so it is a wise venue manager who sites the  
cloakroom elsewhere if possible – and serves the welcome drinks well inside  
the venue!  
The venue manager will know how many guests to expect, and will know the  
peak times of arrival and departure \(being the start and finish times of the event\).  
It must only be poor management, therefore, to under-staff the cloakroom and  
allow queues to form.  
It can be a good idea to cross-train \(or cross-brief\) other staff and utilise them  
to assist with the cloakroom at peak times. Waiters or bar staff who will not  
be busy at the start and finish times will be available for guest arrivals and  
departures. Guests at venues 129  
A courtesy, but also a symbol of professionalism and care, is to provide full-  
length mirrors close to the cloakroom, but not at the cloakroom. Ladies and well-  
groomed gentlemen will wish to check their appearance, and a mirror will draw  
them from this congested area.  
14.3.5 Trip hazards  
Many venues do not pay attention to the hazards created by temporary events.  
The nature of events means cables get temporarily laid across entrances, door-  
ways and carpets. When it is dark or when guests are distracted they may not  
notice a cable lying across the floor.  
All cables must be covered or highlighted to avoid even the risk of a guest trip-  
ping. This is not about what to do if a guest trips over the cable, but ensuring a  
guest cannot trip over the cable.  
An uncovered cable is either poor management or a management that does not  
care about the wellbeing of their guests.  
Other common trip hazards include edges of platforms and podiums, stair edges,  
and the extended legs of tripods for speakers or lights.  
All steps and edges must be highlighted with white tape or hazard tape. The  
legs of tripods must either be highlighted in the same way, or be protected with  
barriers or plants.  
Author’s voice box  
I did come across one venue that had resolved the problem of unseen  
cables causing a trip hazard. They had so many cables laid out, the  
guests had to clamber over them to enter the venue!  
It wasn’t convenient for guests, but at least the cables were obvious and  
visible!  
14.3.6 Toilets  
It is a common mistake for toilets to be unclean. In fact, it is so common that  
guests can become used to finding it and are not surprised.  
Still, it reflects poorly on the standards of any venue. 130 The management of event venues  
Guests do know when something is clean and when it is dirty. Unclean toilet  
areas are unacceptable.  
Venues should provide toilet attendants as readily as they provide bar staff. The  
problem is that venues make money from sales at the bar but there is no revenue  
from toilets. This is why a venue may consider it an unnecessary cost to provide  
toilet attendants. Again, it is only that they do not care about the comfort of their  
guests. It is still about the guest experience.  
An event budget should allow for toilet attendants. If not, the venue should pro-  
vide them.  
Author’s voice box  
When I visit a venue for a show-round, I always enter the ladies’ toilet to  
judge the cleanliness of the venue.  
A venue might not tidy the men’s toilet, but the ladies’ toilet is a good  
measurement of cleanliness.  
I’m less concerned about daily uncleanliness from usage, but whether  
there is long-term poor housekeeping.  
I can cost in to the budget a cleaning team and toilet attendants, but  
if I discover long-term poor housekeeping, I will be concerned about  
attention to detail in other areas of the venue – the kitchen, for example.  
The need is for guests to find toilets clean and presentable – always. If an atten-  
dant is present to assist guests with washing their hands, it promotes courtesy  
and hygiene. It will also act as security and prevent the use of drugs.  
Too many times, toilets are not easy to find nor clearly signposted. Too often,  
toilets are hidden. A guest should never be put in the position to have to ask for  
the location of the toilets.  
14.3.7 Greeting guests  
A venue, an event organiser, and a client will remember to provide guests with  
a greeting as they arrive to an event. It is courtesy. Sometimes, the procedure of  
greeting guests is a necessity for security reasons. This is to ensure that the right Guests at venues 131  
people enter the venue. It is also a legal responsibility to count guests into the  
venue to ensure that capacity levels are not exceeded.  
However, security personnel are not always the most friendly or approachable  
staff. Or, they may not be trained in social etiquette.  
Security is a purpose and, although most security staff are polite and profes-  
sional, it is not security’s role to act as event hosts. It would be less likely to ex-  
pect door hosts to perform the role of security because they would not be trained  
to deal with confrontational situations. Security is one job; hosting is another.  
Each require different skill sets.  
Hosts or hostesses should be positioned at the front door with the sole purpose of  
welcoming guests to the venue. This is true whether security is required or not.  
Door hosts should be familiar with the venue and its surroundings so that they  
can assist guests with questions, directions, taxis and other local queries.  
Hosts should again be positioned at the door at the end of the event to bid good-  
bye to departing guests. This, too, is courtesy. This is the stage where guests may  
require directions or taxis.  
It should be remembered to have door security present at the end of an event as  
well, because this can be the stage where guests have consumed alcohol. As men-  
tioned above, it is wrong to expect hosts to deal with confrontational situations. Part II  
# Event procedures for  
venues Chapter 15  
# Enquiry handling  
The venue manager’s relationship with a client begins before the client becomes  
a client.  
It begins at the enquiry.  
This is why, even at this earliest stage it is important to get the enquiry procedure  
right.  
The first point of contact is the beginning of the client relationship and if the  
experience is not good, the client may not book the venue.  
The one-person management structure is important to observe \(see Chapter 9\).  
First, the venue’s enquiry handler must be personable. Not only is this polite,  
courteous and professional, but this person needs to quickly grasp the needs of  
a potential event client. Event clients will expect the enquiry handler to answer  
event-related questions, provide accurate information about the venue, its facilities,  
capabilities, capacities and provisions such as staffing, technical crew, costs and  
menus. There is an abundance of information to provide for an event enquiry –  
­ information which a staff member outside the events department may not possess.  
The enquiry handler must also possess the knowledge and skills to retain the  
interest of the enquiry for it to progress to the next stage. 136 event procedures for venues  
Note\: The next stage of an enquiry is not necessarily a sale or confirmed booking.  
It could be to forward further information or schedule a venue show-round.  
In addition to all this, the enquiry handler must be adept at recording informa-  
tion on to the venue enquiry form \(see Figure 15.1\) in the manner it is provided  
by a client on the telephone. This involves an understanding of which informa-  
tion is necessary to obtain for every enquiry including those events that will  
not happen.

Figure 15.1 venue enquiry form Enquiry hanDLing 137  
The purpose of the venue enquiry form is to record the basic details of an enquiry  
to the venue – enough to generate a response to a potential client.  
The document does not go into more depth of information because details can  
be discussed at length during the venue show-round where the client views the  
venue, or at a client briefing meeting.  
At this stage the venue does not have a booking, merely an enquiry. So, it requires  
a professional and competent response, but without asserting time and much  
effort for a booking which may never happen.  
Note the following from the venue enquiry form.  
• Each enquiry should be given a File Code which will remain the same should  
the enquiry become a confirmed booking. Thus, each event is individually  
coded and identifiable. This is important where there are many events of the  
same type such as at a wedding venue or conference centre, and where there is  
risk of clients with the same name \(which is a common occurrence with a cor-  
porate client using a venue for a range of events – monthly committee meetings,  
for example. Each monthly event should be attributed an individual file code\).  
• Enquiry Taken By is helpful to record at venues where there is no one-person  
management structure and anybody could take an event enquiry,  
where the venue does not have direct telephone or email access to the events  
department, or where there is an events team and anybody in the depart-  
ment might take an enquiry.  
• The Client Details section is presented early on the form and records the cli-  
ent’s contact information. This information is important for chasing the enquiry,  
for future marketing activities and adding the enquiry to the venue’s database.  
• The Details of the Event is designed for minimal pertinent information and  
is laid out for speed in completion during an enquiry if it is being received  
by telephone.  
• The Action Taken/Action to Take provides a reminder of what stage the  
enquiry has reached and what has happened since taking the enquiry. ‘Ac-  
tion Taken’ could include sending menus, or a venue brochure was sent. ‘Ac-  
tion to Take’ could include a note to follow up on a certain date, or invite the  
potential client to a promotion evening.  
• If the enquiry does not convert to a booking, it should be noted here as to  
why. The amount of enquiries received and rate of conversion to bookings  
can be reported at the HOD meetings and is useful information.  
• Recording the Source of the enquiry will help to measure the success or failure  
of campaigns or advertisements, and from where enquiries are generated. This  
is important when making marketing decisions, but may also show a surprising  
level of enquiries generated from a specific source previously not identified. 138 event procedures for venues  
15.1 Receiving the enquiry  
If an enquiry is received but the venue event manager is unavailable to receive the  
enquiry, the person who is answering the enquiry should only take the potential  
client’s contact details. Things can go wrong even at this earliest stage, such as  
misinformation or mistaken rejection. So, none of the client’s questions should  
be answered by staff other than the venue’s event manager.  
All that needs to happen in such cases is for the contact details to be completed  
on the venue enquiry form, which is why this section appears before any other  
information is taken.  
Then, the contact details on the venue enquiry form can be passed to the venue’s  
event manager on their return to the office and they can proceed with receiving  
the enquiry.  
15.2 Date conflict  
Before any enquiry is entertained it is good practice to research the date of the  
event to ascertain whether there are conflicts.  
Date conflicts may be internal, such as a booking, an enquiry or a provisional  
booking having already been received for the venue, space or room\(s\).  
Even if there is availability in the venue, it may not be possible to entertain con-  
flicting events on the same date – a wedding and a wake, for example  
External date conflicts can have an impact, as well. Attendances at an event can be  
negatively impacted should there be a competitive event on the same date – ­ especially  
if it is in the same industry sector, such as two launches of car brands, say.  
Also, media coverage of an event can be impacted by national or international  
events, such as a royal wedding, or an international football tournament.  
A venue must not expect clients to be aware of the need to research the date of  
the event for conflicts, let alone knowing to consider the impact.  
Private clients, such as wedding clients would not have the professional acumen  
to research date conflicts. But even corporate clients may select a date because of  
its significance \(a company anniversary, perhaps\) and not consider there may be  
a date conflict.  
The day of the event requires research as well. Private clients may select a date for  
a birthday and a corporate client may take the date of the company anniversary,  
without realising that date is a Sunday, or a Bank Holiday. These oversights do  
occur and it is for the venue to identify them. Enquiry hanDLing 139  
Rather than a venue not bothering to research a date for conflicts, or not report-  
ing it to a client for fear of losing the booking \(especially if it is an enquiry and  
not a confirmed booking\), the venue should remember that a client would always  
appreciate being informed. This is again about service to the client and demon-  
strates professional ethics. A client may shift the date of their event, or might  
even bring a future event to the venue because of the professionalism shown –  
clients do reward loyalty.  
A date conflict needs to be identified at the enquiry stage because it would be  
foolhardy to do so after a show-round has been arranged or confirmation has  
been received and that investment in time and effort proves fruitless.  
Additionally, it is better to lose an event before it gets going rather than having it  
cancel off the books. It is also damaging to the reputation of a venue if a cancella-  
tion happens after guests are aware, so it is wise to rule out a date conflict as the  
reason to have to cancel.  
Author’s voice box  
I was asked to organise an event in Milan for Shania Twain. I began by  
researching the date and discovered that the event was in the middle of  
Milan Fashion Week.  
As soon as I informed my client, she cancelled the event.  
I lost this prestigious job.  
But, I did not lose my client.  
I didn’t have a choice but to inform her anyway. It would have been dis-  
covered at some point by somebody, and it would have made me look  
unprofessional if that somebody wasn’t me.  
I could have done a lot of preliminary work before the date conflict was  
revealed. The event would get cancelled and all my work would have  
been wasted.  
Anyway, the logistics would have been problematic for me to organise a  
high-profile event in Milan during Fashion Week. Venues would already  
be booked and not available for me; I would have had trouble hiring lim-  
ousines; I would have struggled to get security … And the press would  
be elsewhere, snapping the supermodels on catwalks.  
Ethically and logistically, I did the right thing. 140 event procedures for venues  
15.3 Enquiry file procedure  
A venue should not consider an enquiry as a ‘booking’ until the client confirms  
the event.  
Until confirmation is received from the client, the Venue Enquiry Form remains  
in the Enquiry File.  
During the period when the Venue Enquiry Form is held in the Enquiry File the  
venue manager will periodically follow-up the lead and record the activity in the  
Action Taken/Action to Take section of the form.  
An effective means for a venue to chase clients to either confirm or release an  
enquiry is to agree to hold the date for a certain period – a provisional booking. This  
secures the date for the client on the understanding that the venue manager will  
contact the client when the hold-period expires or when another enquiry is re-  
ceived for that same date. The client will then need to confirm the event, release  
the date, or extend the provisional booking.  
The Enquiry File should fill with enquiries which have not confirmed. If the date  
of the proposed event has expired, the Enquiry Form does not get thrown away  
but stays in the Enquiry File as a record of the following information.  
• Where each enquiry was generated \(the source section on the form\).  
• The number of enquiries received which are in the Enquiry File. Counting  
how many enquiries are in this file will show how many enquiries were re-  
ceived over any given period.  
• This information also helps identify patterns of peak and off-peak demand,  
and when enquiries are being received during the year. It may suggest when  
marketing campaigns are required to generate enquiries in low-demand  
periods.  
• Reasons for discontinuance. The forms still in the Enquiry File will pro-  
vide reasons why each enquiry did not convert to a confirmation. This might  
highlight an issue which needs addressing. Perhaps, there is a nearby com-  
petitor reaping events business, for example.  
• Conversion rate. It is helpful to understand how many enquiries do not con-  
vert to confirmations as this determines the conversion rate. If the conver-  
sion rate is low, this could suggest an issue with the enquiry procedure or the  
show-round procedure.  
• Tracking activity. By looking at the activity records listed on each enquiry  
form in the Enquiry File, the venue can measure the value of chasing clients Enquiry hanDLing 141  
by which methods. For example, if enquiries have not been chased for two  
weeks because the events manager was away, this could show why there was  
a lower conversion rate during that period. This could be valuable to ascer-  
tain whether the recruitment of a sales person or assistant events manager is  
required to help convert business.  
It can be seen the value of retaining enquiry forms even where the event does not  
happen, or where an enquiry is not going to happen. The former may be because  
a client booked elsewhere. The latter could be because the venue was too small  
to accommodate the number of guests. Whatever the reason for an enquiry not  
going ahead, the Venue Enquiry Form must be retained. Only when the enquiry  
converts to a confirmed booking will the form be removed from the Enquiry File.  
The Enquiry File is also valuable in providing the venue with a database of poten-  
tial clients. This is essential for future marketing campaigns and mail-outs, such  
as for Christmas parties or promotion evenings. Even those enquiries which did  
not convert still remain as potential clients for any future events they may wish  
to place into a venue.  
Each enquiry received is a future sales lead. Chapter 16  
# Show-round procedure  
If the enquiry is handled efficiently by the venue event manager and the  
venue is available on the date of the event, a potential client will wish to view  
the venue for themselves, meet the venue manager and discuss the event  
in greater detail. This initial viewing of the venue is the show-round or recce  
\(reconnaissance\).  
The show-round would likely be the first face-to-face contact between the venue  
manager and a client.  
Personality will be a major contributory factor during this first meeting. If for  
whatever reason the client does not get on with the venue event manager – i.e.  
the person in charge of the success of the event – then the client will not book  
the venue.  
The show-round is also the client’s first impression of the venue – not only the  
physical appearance of its style and décor, but how well it is run, and the experi-  
ence and professionalism of its events manager.  
A show-round of the venue is vital for the client \(the ‘client’ of a venue can be an  
event organiser, event agent, event company or direct client\) so they can make an  
informed decision about using a venue for their event. Show-round procedure 143  
Author’s voice box  
At the show-round of a venue I was considering to use for a launch party,  
I noticed a smart new apartment building adjacent to the car park.  
When I mentioned to the venue manager my concerns of noise because  
my event would run into the early hours, with music inside and smokers  
outside, he was flippant and said, ‘It doesn’t matter, don’t worry about  
that; we were here first.’  
I chose not to contribute any upset for the residents in that apartment  
block and so I did not book that venue.  
I also wasn’t comfortable to bring the events industry into disrepute by  
making an event a problem for other people who live nearby the venue.  
Plus, I was wary of the risk if any residents were to complain about the  
noise at my event\: I could have the police attending the event to demand  
the music stops or the venue closes. This would cause problems on the  
night, but also my client might take a negative view of me booking a  
venue where the police turn up to close us down! I don’t welcome blame.  
Stacking it up, it was better to find an alternative venue for that event.  
A show-round is also the first opportunity for a venue manager to show off and  
display the venue to secure a client. This is so important that there should be  
procedures in place for each show-round, just like any other live happening.  
• All heads of department should be informed the day before the show-round,  
so as to ensure all departments are aware and prepared that a client will be  
in the building to make a decision about placing business there.  
• On the day of the show-round, the events manager must ensure all areas are  
ready before the time the client is due to arrive to the venue. It is not enough  
to expect heads of department to ready their areas – they have other prior-  
ities and demands. It must be treated as an event, which means the events  
manager must check all areas of the venue on the day of the show-round.  
• A sound and/or lighting technician should be available to demonstrate to the  
client the lighting, sound, projection and other technical facilities.  
• The venue should be presented in the correct ‘mode’ for the type of event  
that the client is looking to place in to the venue. This mode is how the venue  
would be presented for a fashion show, presentation, party, stage production, 144 event procedures for venues  
product launch, or other type of event depending on the nature of the enquiry.  
It is important for a client to see and feel how a venue will look during their  
event. Pictures help, but the show-round is not for ‘showing’ how a venue can  
look, it is about demonstrating the venue to a client while the client is onsite.  
• The show-round is a real sales opportunity and should not be treated as  
merely a prospect chance of business.  
• As with any live happening, the events manager should do a final walk-round  
of the venue before the client arrives to view it\:  
• to check for cleanliness of all areas  
•  
 to identify any problems \(dirty areas; maintenance issues; blown light-  
bulbs; cleaning equipment left out\)  
• to ensure that staff are not lounging in groups for breaks or lunch  
•  
 to ensure that the technician is in place and brief him on the specific  
requirements of this potential client and their event.  
• If the venue is dark or windowless \(such as a nightclub\) it can be a stark  
contrast for a client entering from the outside. This can be counteracted with  
fresh flowers in reception, which brings a little of the outside into the venue.  
• Ensure that there is a quiet space or room available in which to have a dis-  
cussion with the client.  
• Offer tea, coffee and water – this is a personal interaction, after all. Demon-  
strate hospitality and courtesy because the client has taken time and effort  
to travel to the venue.  
Venue show-rounds are essential for the client/venue relationship. Good commu-  
nication is key to winning a client and making their event a success, and it begins  
at this first meeting.  
This first meeting is also when the venue manager has the opportunity to ascer-  
tain the event experience of the client, their expectations and their needs. The  
venue manager has the opportunity to learn about their client and understand  
whether they will need to provide substantial guidance.  
Essentially \(but not only\) the show-round is a sales tool. It is the opportunity to  
convert an enquiry to a sale.  
If the show-round is unprepared and unprofessional the enquiry will not convert  
to a sale.  
However, it is a poorly managed venue that considers the show-round as a sales  
opportunity first and foremost. Show-round procedure 145  
The salesy approach is obvious to recognise from the outset\:  
• the venue manager adopts a ‘sales patter’ to the show-round  
• the venue manager will tend to disparage competitor venues  
• the venue manager will promise everything to the client, merely to achieve  
the sale. Clients distrust this approach because it is likely the venue will not  
deliver, or even not remember what they had promised.  
Those venues which do treat the show-round as a sales opportunity first and  
foremost, tend not to be honest with their clients. An experienced client or events  
specialist will recognise this.  
Actually, the approach of the venue manager should be to impart trust. A client  
will never book a venue if it is not suitable, so it is foolhardy to ‘sell’ the venue  
to a client. If the venue is suitable for the event and the client trusts in the event  
manager, the sale will happen.  
Always, the venue manager should guide a client, which is why it can be impor-  
tant to ascertain the client’s experience in events. Some clients may hide their  
experience to see whether a salesman trips himself up. But, it is not helpful to the  
relationship to attempt to teach an experienced client.  
Guiding a client also means being honest with them that some requirements  
may not work at the venue. The venue manager should demonstrate care for the  
reputation of the venue, which means not allowing anything and everything to  
happen, just to achieve the sale.  
If an event is not going to suit the venue it will result in a wrong event. It is better  
not to have the event, than to have a wrong event.  
If the venue is not right for the event, due to its style, size or other logistical fac-  
tors, then it would be impossible to make right.  
No venue manager should ever allow a wrong event to happen in their venue.  
It will let down the client, reflect poorly on the venue, result in conflict and  
bill-wrangling, and harm the reputation of the venue for achieving future busi-  
ness and repeat business.  
The point of the show-round is to present a quality venue to a client. The client  
should feel informed, not sold-to. Chapter 17  
# Confirmation and  
# contract procedure  
If the venue show-round was successful, the venue will receive notification from  
the client that the event is going ahead – confirmation will be received.  
At this point, the date of the confirmed event should be marked in the venue  
calendar or the provisional hold should be converted to a confirmed booking.  
Updating the venue calendar is important so as to prevent double bookings and  
overbookings. Similarly, if an event cancels, the venue calendar must be updated  
to show the space is now available to sell.  
Some venues use colours or symbols in their venue calendar to denote enquiries,  
provisional bookings, confirmed bookings and cancelled bookings.  
When an enquiry gets converted to a confirmation, the Enquiry Form gets trans-  
ferred to the Client File \(see Chapter 19\).  
17.1 Venue contract \(Appendix ii\)  
At the point of receiving confirmation the venue will raise a venue hire contract.  
It should be remembered that a contract protects both parties and should be both  
balanced and equal towards both parties. It would be unethical practice for a  
venue to stipulate unreasonable and unfair clauses. Confirmation and contract procedure 147  
Appendix II provides an example of a venue hire contract. However, the main  
points to include are as follows.  
• Date and day of hire  
It is good practice to state within the contract the day as well as the date of  
the event. Sometimes a client has chosen a date for their event for a particu-  
lar reason, such as a company anniversary, without realising the date falls on  
a Sunday, for example.  
Most corporate clients avoid Fridays for events because it is considered the  
start of the weekend. Likewise, weekend events are avoided because it is  
considered bad etiquette for a company to expect its staff or clients to be  
available at a weekend when this is ‘family’ time.  
If it is a family event provided by a company, such as a corporate fun day for  
clients or employees and their families, it could take place on a weekend.  
Celebrity-attended events tend to avoid Fridays and weekends because there  
is a general view that celebrities are unavailable or are away and out of the  
city.  
• Hire period  
The hire period goes further than the date because not all hire periods are  
midnight-to-midnight or 24-hour hires.  
The contracted hire period states the start and finish times of the period of  
hire, which is not the same as when the doors open and close for the event.  
The hire period start time would usually be earlier than the beginning of the  
event itself because there will always be a need for deliveries and setting-up.  
This is known as the get-in time where the period of hire of the venue begins  
earlier than the event itself. So, the contracted hire period should commence  
with the required or allowed access or get-in time.  
Some venues are open to the public, so the venue should show the allowable  
access time. If the venue closes to the public at 6pm, say, the venue may not  
be accessible until all public have vacated the premises, which could be 7 pm\:  
7 pm would be the contracted hire period commencement.  
Sometimes, the event set-up is complex and will require one, two or more  
days in advance of the event. This is particularly so with exhibition set-ups,  
filming, highly technical events, for set-building, and for large theme and  
decoration projects. In such cases the hire period within the contract must  
state the accessible set-up days and times.  
If the event is in the early morning, there will be a need to hire the venue for  
all or part of the day before for set-up and rehearsals. 148 event procedures for venues  
At the other end of the event – the end of the contracted hire period – it  
would be unusual for the hire period to end when the guests leave and the  
doors close.  
It can take time to clear \(de-rig\) an event to dismantle \(strike\) sets, stag-  
ing, technical equipment, theming, decoration, branding, installations  
and furniture. The venue must allow for this even if the client does not  
stipulate the need. Some clients may not wish to pay for extended times  
to de-rig because they are already in the venue, so what can the venue do  
about it anyway? This can lead to arguments, which is a risk the venue  
must plan to avoid. Conflict after an event can sour what was a successful  
event and the client/venue relationship can falter at this late stage. This  
leads to damaged reputation and to the loss of future business and repeat  
business.  
The end of the hire period is referred to as the get-out time and the venue  
should be clear by that time.  
A typical contracted hire period may read thus\:  
Event Date\: Thursday 14th May  
Hire Period\: 06\:30 Get-in \(access from\)  
16\:00 Doors open  
21\:00 Doors close  
00\:00 Get-out \(venue clear\)  
Set-up and de-rig days either side of the event day itself are usually discounted  
by the venue. The industry standard is 50% of the usual hire fee. This does vary  
from venue to venue, however, and may be open to negotiation depending on fac-  
tors such as overall spend, the profile of the event and charity status.  
A venue should not permit access to the venue before the contracted get-in time.  
A venue can easily control this.  
However, a venue cannot easily control event over-runs or a de-rig that takes  
longer than anticipated. For this reason, the venue may charge penalties for over-  
staying the contracted hire period.  
The venue hire contract must state the penalties incurred in such situations. In  
practice, however, venues are lenient and flexible. No venue wishes to inflict pen-  
alty charges upon their clients because it sours the relationship and harms future  
potential business. Penalty clauses exist to either deter overruns, or speed them  
up should they occur. Confirmation and contract procedure 149  
• Itinerary  
It is good practice for the venue to include an outline itinerary within the  
hire contract. This will show at an early stage that the venue and client are  
working to the same timings, which is important for the hire period. It will  
also demonstrate to the client that the venue understands the nature of the  
event.  
A typical outline itinerary may read as follows\:  
16\:00 Get-in for setting-up  
18\:00 Rehearsal  
19\:00 Doors open  
20\:00 Presentation  
20\:30 Dinner  
22\:00 Dancing  
24\:00 End  
01\:00 Get-out and venue clear  
An outline itinerary suggests the schedule could change. At the early stage of con-  
firmation and raising the contract, timings must be allowed to change. The basic  
timings, and especially the get-in and get-out times \(the contracted hire period\)  
would not normally change.  
• Cost of hire \(also known as hire fee, venue fee or facility fee\) and penalty charges  
should be clearly stated within the contract  
• Payment structure  
The payment structure should be clearly set out in a contract. Usually, ven-  
ues require a deposit to confirm the booking and book the date. Without a  
deposit the venue would not consider a booking as being confirmed, so the  
date is still at risk of being sold to another client. Similarly, a client should  
not consider that a venue is securely holding the date for their event until  
they have paid the deposit to the venue.  
The deposit would usually be 50% of the hire fee, but in some cases it can be  
the entire hire fee as the deposit to secure the date and consider the booking  
as confirmed. The balance of the hire fee \(i.e. the remaining 50%\) could be  
paid in stages set out in the contract. Always, the hire fee must be settled in  
full before the date of the event. Venues will stipulate in the contract how far  
in advance of the event the hire fee must be settled in full. 150 event procedures for venues  
The contract will state that if the full hire fee is not received by the venue in  
advance of the event, the venue will cancel the booking.  
• Cancellation procedure and charges  
Because events do cancel, the deposit can be anything from 50% to 80%.  
Some venues require 100% at the time of confirming the booking and sign-  
ing the contract.  
Venues need to enforce a cancellation procedure because the client is re-  
serving the date, and the venue needs to optimise its business. If the event  
cancels for whatever reason, the date can be left unsold and cannot be resold  
in the future – thus, event space is a perishable item because it has a date of  
expiry after which it cannot be resold.  
Events are cancelled for a wide range of reasons and it can be on the side  
of the client or the venue. There are elements out of anyone’s control that  
necessitate a cancellation, such as the illness or death of a performer \(think  
of Michael Jackson, for example, who was confirmed and booked to play  
London\); inclement weather; lack of interest from guests, which would im-  
pact attendance, or from ticket-buyers, which would impact sales as a reve-  
nue stream; health and safety issues not overcome; or the inability to gain  
licences and permissions for the event to go ahead.  
Having a cancellation procedure makes things clear for both parties. It would  
be unprofessional to argue at a later stage about who cancelled, why and when.  
And, it would be unfortunate and expensive to have to take the matter to court.  
Usually, a venue would present its cancellation charges as a sliding scale. For  
example\:  
100% refundable if cancellation is received in excess of two months prior to  
the date of the event.  
50% refundable if cancellation is received between two months and one  
month prior to the date of the event.  
Non-refundable if cancellation is received within one month prior to the date  
of the event.  
This type of cancellation structure reflects the probability of the venue reselling  
the date to another client. The closer the cancellation is to the event date, the less  
likely the venue will resell that date to another client.  
• Areas of hire  
All areas of the venue that are included within the hire fee should be identi-  
fied within the contract. This would include room names; the use of break-  
out rooms; foyers; courtyards; terraces, gardens, lawns and annexes. Confirmation and contract procedure 151  
Where rooms or spaces are provided without additional charge and consid-  
ered within the hire package, such as dressing rooms, a production office,  
changing rooms, or storage rooms, they must be listed on the venue hire  
contract as without additional charge.  
• Facilities and services  
If the venue is providing facilities and services within the hire fee these should  
be listed within the contract as being included. For example\:  
Hire includes cloakroom, 1× sound technician, 1× light engineer, 2× security, 1×  
event manager.  
Facilities and services which are additional to the hire fee should be noted in  
attachments to the venue hire contract. For example\:  
Catering 400 guests @ £20.00 per person  
Beverages charged by consumption  
Disco £150.00  
Dance floor £80.00  
If the client has declined facilities or services, or is bringing their own, these  
should be stated, also. For example\:  
Balloon nets not required.  
Gift bags\: client’s own.  
To manage expectations and prevent misinterpretations it can be worthwhile for  
the venue to list the staff-count in the facilities and services section of the venue  
hire contract. For example\:  
6× waiters, 3× cloakroom attendants, 5× bar staff, 4× security  
It should be remembered that the purpose of a contract is to uphold the respon-  
sibilities of each party. So, if a venue has promised 6 waiters and this is stated in  
the contract, it must duly provide the 6 waiters. Thus, both parties are protected  
and expectations are not misinterpreted or unfulfilled.  
• Force majeure  
This clause holds no party liable for failures arising due to causes beyond  
their reasonable control. For example\:  
Power failure  
Internet service failure 152 event procedures for venues  
Fire, flooding, storms, earthquakes  
Civil unrest  
Industrial action  
Acts of terrorism  
• Liability and indemnity  
Because the venue hire contract is a legal document, the insurance, health  
and safety, and damage to property clauses must be stated.  
The venue should make clients aware that their valuables, clothing, display  
materials and other items may not be the responsibility of the venue. This  
should be clearly set out in the venue hire contract.  
• Confidentiality  
Many clients require confidentiality from the venue, the venue’s staff, and  
their contractors. This is particularly required where celebrities or VIPs are  
attending an event. Also at conferences where sensitive corporate informa-  
tion, strategies, statistics or sales information may be revealed.  
A good venue manager will want photographs of all events at their venue for  
use with future venue marketing purposes and their client portfolio. Permis-  
sion for this activity should be stated within the venue hire contract so the  
client can authorise the use of their brand identity or company name.

At the Brit Awards all staff are informed not to approach any artist.  
If any staff member approaches a vip, celebrity or artist they will be  
ejected from the event.  
There must be no photos, recordings or videos taken onsite. There must  
be no photographs taken of passes and wristbands.  
No social media posts may be made relating to ‘performers, guest pre-  
senters, costumes, performance details or any other descriptive details  
… until after 10pm on the night of the event’.  
Notices are posted at all staff entry points to remind them of these  
rules. Confirmation and contract procedure 153  
• Anticipated number of guests  
The venue should state in the venue hire contract the anticipated number of  
guests and the date when final numbers must be finalised by the client.  
At this early stage, it would be acceptable to state ‘minimum 100 guests’;  
‘100–125 guests’; or ‘maximum 125 guests’. What is important is to set the  
understanding of how many guests are expected to attend the event.  
This is important for anticipated catering numbers \(and the revenue from ca-  
tering\), anticipated revenue from drinks sales, adequate staffing levels \(and  
cost to the venue thereof\), and to ensure that the client is aware of the max-  
imum legal capacity of the venue which they are booking.  
• Catering  
If the menu has not been decided at the point of raising the venue hire con-  
tract, it should simply state ‘menu to be decided.’ The menu choice can be  
included later as an annexe to the venue hire contract.  
However, the cost of the menu may already have been agreed because the cli-  
ent would have a budget which would include catering for their guests. Alto,  
the venue would require to know from the outset the spend on catering to  
ascertain the revenue from this stream. If this is so, the catering cost should  
be stated within the venue hire contract, even where there is no menu.  
Note\: Catering and other costs are charged outside the venue hire fee and  
would not form part of the deposit. This is especially so with catering and  
bar \(food and beverage or F&B\), because exact costs for these areas cannot  
be determined until guest numbers are finalised, which may even be after  
the event has taken place.  
In such instances where final numbers of catering will be counted after the  
event, a minimum guaranteed number will be required by the event caterer or  
venue chef, whereby the client guarantees a minimum number of guests re-  
quiring food at the event. This allows for the venue to anticipate the revenue  
from this stream. It also protects the client from a situation where the caterer  
does not provide enough meals. And, it protects the caterer from providing  
100 meals, say, when only 80 guests attend and the client insists on paying  
only for the number of guests who attended.  
Once the venue hire contract has been raised, it is sent to the client for  
approval and signature. When it is returned, the date of the event can be  
confirmed in the venue calendar. Chapter 18  
# Lead-in procedure  
The ‘lead-in’ is the period between the venue receiving confirmation and the date  
of the event.  
To clarify\:  
1 The Enquiry Stage is from when the enquiry is received, until the booking is  
confirmed.  
2 The Lead-In is from when the booking is confirmed, until the date of the event.  
3 Pre-event management is the planning which happens before the event, that  
is during the lead-in period.  
4 Operational event management is the running of the event onsite on the day  
of the event.  
5 Post-event management are the procedures to enact after the event, such as  
debriefing meetings and guest satisfaction evaluation.  
The venue must make good use of the lead-in period. From the point where con-  
firmation is received there is opportunity for planning the event and nurturing  
the client relationship.  
It is common practice but poor venue management to let a booking sit in the diary  
once it has confirmed. This can happen when a venue manager is too focused on Lead-in procedure 155  
sales and treats each sale as a conquest – ‘job done’ – and moves on to securing  
the next sale. If this style of management is allowed to occur, the lead-in period  
gets wasted and this essential planning time is compromised. The venue will tend  
to pick up the logistics too close to the event and be forced into a reactive style  
rather than proactive planning ahead of the event.  
Allowing a lead-in period to dissipate, simply creates a shorter lead-in.  
Venues which have a poor management structure typically tend to jump from one  
event to the next, which leads to developing a reactive management style, rather  
than a proactive management style.  
A venue needs to achieve focus on the delivery of service standards to their con-  
firmed clients. This in turn will achieve greater satisfaction and better sales be-  
cause of repeat business, word of mouth referrals and good reputation.  
Author’s voice box  
Whether I am in the role of venue manager, client or freelance event  
specialist, I always allow a minimum three-month lead-in. This has be-  
come my rule of self-discipline.  
The lead-in period between receiving a confirmed event and the date of  
that event is essential for gathering information, planning the concept,  
researching, finding and securing suppliers, and negotiating prices.  
I have found that short lead-ins result in limited choices, quick decisions  
and knee-jerk reactions. When this happens the lead-in leads me, rather  
than me having the ability to manage the lead-in. Mistakes are made  
when time is short.  
Venues can reduce the lead-in if there are quick-turnaround events. These may  
be small functions; frequent repeat business of the same type, such as meetings;  
repeat business from the same client, such as a monthly meeting; or short-notice  
bookings, such as wakes.  
Even so, venues should calculate the lead-in required for each type of event they  
host so that they do not compromise the time to plan and organise an event.  
Short lead-ins are manageable, so long as the people involved with the event un-  
derstand how to achieve it all within in the limited time-frame available. 156 event procedures for venues  
From the moment a booking confirms with the venue and until the event takes  
place \(the lead-in period\) a bond must exist between venue manager and client.  
After all, they are both working towards reaching the same objective of delivering  
a successful event.  
The duty of the venue manager is to lead this relationship, not expect it. It takes  
work; it takes leadership.  
It can be easy for a venue to think that the client is in power and will lead the  
relationship because they are paying the bill for the event. But, not all clients are  
aware of this as a role of event planning. Some clients want to lead \(even when  
they should not be leading\) yet other clients expect the venue to lead them.  
Actually, the venue has the power because it knows the venue better than the  
client \(the venue is the ‘real’ event manager\) and will possibly know more about  
event management than the client \(this is determined during building the client  
relationship\). Whichever way it is, the venue must control everything that hap-  
pens within their venue, which includes controlling the client relationship. This  
is where client relations are forged.  
Author’s voice box  
Most venue managers do not make the effort to visit the client at their  
office. This is because it is always convenient for the client to come to the  
venue for the show-round and ongoing meetings. The venue is where  
the event will take place and the client will want to visit to meet the chef  
or caterer, decorators, and other suppliers during the planning stages.  
As a venue manager, I would often search for a reason to visit my clients  
as soon as possible at *their* place of work. Usually, I would deliver the  
contract to them by hand if practicable and use this as the reason to get  
to their office.  
While at their workplace, I would be looking whether their working en-  
vironment is relaxed or formal; modern or old-fashioned; organised or  
in disarray... I would see whether they have photographs on their desk  
of their children or partner, dog or cat, and we can begin talking about  
these interests.  
I found such insights to a client valuable in forging the client relationship  
as I could ascertain the culture and work ethic of both my client and their  
organisation. Lead-in procedure 157  
During the lead-in period the venue manager must gather information about the  
event and build a profile of the client.  
The venue manager is there to provide assistance, first and foremost. Thereafter,  
to provide the services that have been agreed and ensure that they are delivered.  
If following the practice of the one-person management structure as laid out in  
Chapter 9, the venue manager should remain the one point of liaison between the  
venue and the client, and must collate information from the venue’s departments  
and suppliers to provide to the client.  
It is for the venue manager to arrange meetings with departments and suppliers,  
and be present at such meetings. Not to be included in any meeting between the  
client and a supplier or department would mean losing control of the planning  
of the event.  
Even one absence from a meeting could suggest to the client that the venue man-  
ager is not needed for everything. This is dangerous because the client could  
begin the process of talking to that other party for that particular need and the  
venue manager will become excluded. It may also allow a relationship to develop  
between the client and that other party which could undermine the control of the  
venue manager and result in being sidelined.  
If the client requires menus and menu costs, the venue manager will liaise with  
the chef or catering manager for such information, and duly provide the menus  
and costs to the client.  
If a menu tasting is required, the venue manager will arrange this meeting and  
will attend the tasting with the client. It is yet another opportunity to reinforce  
the client relationship.  
The objective of venue management is that by the date of the event all informa-  
tion has been gathered by the venue manager and an established working rela-  
tionship with the client exists. Chapter 19  
# Client file procedure  
A client file is opened for each client once confirmation is received.  
All information about the event and the client, which is being gathered by the  
venue manager during the lead-in, is placed in to the client file.  
At the point of confirmation when a new client file is opened, it would already in-  
clude the Enquiry Form \(now removed from the Enquiry File\), the confirmation  
letter and the venue hire contract.  
Every activity that occurs; each decision which is made by the client; every re-  
port of meetings, such as at the show-round and menu tasting, is placed into the  
client file.  
By the time the event occurs the client file will be filled with detailed information  
about what has happened from the start of the project.  
The client file should be so detailed that if the venue manager is absent for what-  
ever reason, any other member of the venue team could pick up a client file and  
know every aspect of that event. This is how comprehensive the client file must  
be. To put it another way\: nothing should be left out of the client file. Client file procedure 159  
Here follows a list of what typically could be contained in a Client File\:  
• enquiry form  
• client contact details  
• notes and observations about the client; the client’s likes and dislikes  
• proposal  
• venue hire contract  
• quotes and discounts  
• budget  
• contact reports from meetings  
• menu choice and tasting notes  
• details of suppliers and contractors for the event \(or the client’s suppliers and  
contractors for the event\), what they are providing, the quantities, prices,  
delivery details  
• invoices  
• debriefing notes  
• Final Report.  
It should be noted that where client information is held on a database or elec-  
tronic file, data protection regulations must be observed for legal compliance. Chapter 20  
# Client relationship  
# procedures  
Even at the early stage of confirmation the client relationship is already estab-  
lishing itself. This is evident because the venue manager would have conducted  
a number of telephone conversations with the client, hosted the show-round,  
discussed requirements such as catering and technical needs, and possibly held  
subsequent meetings at the venue to satisfy the client for them to make their  
decision before the contract is raised and the booking is confirmed.  
The enquiry process is usually short and the confirmation is received early. This  
is because clients are keen to secure their choice of venue for the date of their  
event.  
Also, not much else can move forward with the planning of an event without  
knowledge of which venue will be hosting the event.  
So, the bulk of building the client relationship happens after confirmation has  
been received by the venue.  
However, that is not a rule. Sometimes, the enquiry procedure continues for a  
longer duration and may involve a number of show-rounds with various inter-  
ested parties. If it is a film crew, for example, the location scout may visit the  
venue; then the location manager; then the director of the film... Client relationship procedures 161  
Or, if a client is considering a range of suitable venues and has a lengthy lead-in  
period, they might be in less of a hurry.  
For a venue, it can become frustrating to receive a potential client over an ex-  
tended period and have to be available every time they wish to view the venue –  
without any guarantee that the event will go ahead as a booking.  
It could mean having to prepare their ongoing demands such as costs, permis-  
sions and menus.  
If the event does not confirm, it can feel like a bitter blow and not worth the  
effort. This could negatively impact the venue manager’s future approach to de-  
manding enquiries. But, every enquiry and each show-round is an opportunity to  
exercise the venue’s enquiry procedures, as well as developing the venue manag-  
er’s social skills and responses to questions.  
The business of winning clients and hosting their events is largely about network-  
ing and contacts.  
It must be kept in mind, therefore, that the people viewing a venue are still po-  
tential clients, even if this current event does not convert\: these people will have  
future projects; they may move on to other companies; they will probably remain  
in the area of events and booking venues.  
Additionally, each person is a potential referral to other people they know.  
So, those people whom are considering the venue are an extension of the venue’s  
public relations and marketing campaigns.  
Once a booking is confirmed, the real work of building the client relationship  
begins. It should be remembered that relationships can deteriorate as well as  
strengthen. Experience teaches that if there is a long gap in communication, the  
relationship suffers from neglect.  
Even if the confirmed event is straightforward for the venue, it is worthwhile  
for the venue manager to place courtesy calls to the client with the objective of  
maintaining the client relationship.  
Complacency is an enemy. So, even if an event is straightforward \(for the venue at  
least\) – perhaps because it is a repeat of a previous event\: a wedding at a wedding  
venue, for example, or a conference at a conference venue; or because it is a repeat  
client and their event is a reoccurrence – it must be treated such that each event is  
a new project and every client is an individual. Whatever the situation, any client  
deserves total support from the venue they have booked and are paying for. 162 event procedures for venues  
It cannot be overstated how important is the venue-to-client relationship. For  
this reason, the one-person management structure \(see Chapter 9\) has been de-  
veloped to ensure that the client is not passed from one person to another at the  
venue. If this happens, the client will need to rebuild relations from scratch with  
each new contact they encounter.  
Importantly, if problems or challenges do occur, a good working relationship  
­ allows people to find solutions. Chapter 21  
# Event schedule/  
# function sheet  
# \(Appendix III\)  
The event schedule \(or function sheet\) is an itinerary or ‘running order’ for the day of  
the event. Its purpose is to show everything which has been planned to occur onsite.  
From start to finish – get-in to get-out – every action and responsibility is set onto  
the event schedule.  
By the time the lead-in period finishes because the day of the event has arrived,  
every requirement for the event will be in place and set out on the event schedule.  
If something is not on the event schedule, it has not been planned to hap-  
pen. If it has not been planned to happen it should not be happening.  
Nothing should happen in the venue if it is not known about and has not been  
planned. It is the venue manager’s responsibility to know this; to understand this.  
If a client should introduce an element on the day, the venue manager should  
consider refusing the request. No surprises must happen.  
In events, surprise = risk.  
The venue manager will begin constructing the event schedule as soon as the  
booking is confirmed. Thereafter, it is a working, organic, evolving document  
which gets continually updated so that no detail is left off the Schedule. 164 event procedures for venues  
Each time an action to happen at the event is known – is planned for – the venue  
manager will add it to the event schedule, until the exact itinerary for the event  
is finalised.  
Close to the event day – one or two days prior, say – the event schedule is final-  
ised and distributed to each person whom holds any responsibility at the event.  
Typically for a venue, it is distributed to each head of department so that every  
department is prepared for every event.  
In many cases, the client might produce the event schedule – particularly if the  
client is an events organiser or an events company. In such situations, the venue  
manager must approve all activities within the Schedule before it is finalised and  
distributed. Usually, the venue manager would know what has been planned, but  
should be included with the approval of the event schedule, nonetheless.  
Where the client is producing the event schedule, the venue manager may still  
produce a Schedule for the venue, heads of department and venue staff. This  
Schedule would be specific for the venue’s requirements and would follow the  
format recognised by all members of venue management and staff. A copy of this  
schedule may be sent to the client for information because it may help confirm  
the alignment of expectations, but not necessarily so, as it is considered an inter-  
nal document.  
Although the event schedule is a document to show the itinerary on the day of an  
event, some events run for more than one day.  
In some cases there will be activities occurring at the venue before or after the  
event date itself.  
Before an event, there could be set-up day\(s\), stage-build days, décor and theme  
days, technical set-up, pre-event deliveries, or pre-event rehearsals. After an  
event it can be de-rig day\(s\) and collections.  
In such cases, the event schedule will have one page for each day where some  
activity or responsibility occurs.  
If the event itself runs for more than one day – such as a three-day exhibition –  
the event schedule should have one page for each day, even if one day is a du-  
plication of the previous day. This is because, in most cases, there are minor  
adjustments to be shown for each day. The first day requires setting-up and the  
last day requires breaking-down, for example. But, there may be a party on the  
middle day, or an award to present on the final day, or a closing speech. These  
variants are important for the venue team to know. Event schedule/function sheet 165  
Appendix III provides an example of a function sheet/event schedule. However,  
the main points to include are as follows.  
• Event title, date and short brief  
With venues which are busy with events it is necessary to include the event  
title, date and a short brief. This will prevent any confusion by staff or HODs  
who pick up the wrong event schedule. This is often a problem with staff no-  
ticeboards, where staff are looking at a similar but out-of-date event schedule.  
Even with venues which host infrequent events, mistakes can still happen  
if the event schedule does not show the title, date and a brief. So, it is good  
practice to do so.  
The event ‘title’ can be the client’s name, company name, or type of event.  
The ‘brief’ will be a short description to explain the nature of the event to  
anyone reading the event schedule. It sets the context for the event and is  
important for temporary and casual staff so that they understand and appre-  
ciate the nature of the event. For example\: ‘This event is the product launch of a  
new fruity soft drink by Schweppes being promoted to drinks buyers, publicans, and  
the drinks industry press.’  
Author’s voice box  
Some venue managers include a contact list on the front of the event  
schedule, which contains the names and telephone numbers of key per-  
sonnel involved with the event.  
I do not like to include a contact list on an event schedule for two reasons.  
First, the names and telephone numbers of key personnel is sensitive  
information. The event schedule is a document which is copied and dis-  
tributed to a range of personnel, staff, suppliers and providers, and of-  
ten gets lost or left behind after an event.  
Second, I keep the contact details of key personnel in the client file,  
which never leaves me. So, if I need anybody’s contact details, it is al-  
ways to hand. I fail to see why everyone else needs such information.  
In venues there will be an office where names and phone numbers can  
be securely stored and easily retrieved, so it is senseless to include such  
information on an event schedule. 166 event procedures for venues  
• Day and time  
The first column on the event schedule lists the time of an activity. The  
second column lists each activity. The third column lists who is responsible  
for the activity. The fourth column acts as a tick-list for the venue manager  
to check each activity has happened – thus, the event schedule becomes the  
venue manager’s onsite checklist.

It may be written to show the allowable timings of each activity.  
16\:30–17\:00RehearsalTechnical crew ✓

• Distribution  
At the bottom of the Event Schedule there is a distribution list to show who  
should receive the document.  
This can be utilised by an email distribution group, but is an important tool  
to remind the events manager who requires a copy.  
It can be useful to mark each name on the distribution list when it is handed  
to the relevant recipient to identify who has lost their copy if it is found in  
the venue before or during the event. Chapter 22  
# Operational  
# procedures  
Operational procedures are those which occur on the day of the event – the onsite  
procedures or onsite logistics.  
The venue manager must act like the concierge of an excellent hotel\: knowing  
from where to source all needs. The client may not be local, and in any case may  
not be experienced in managing events, whereas the venue manager has these  
two important advantages.  
Because the planning of the event would have been undertaken during the lead-in  
period, every aspect which is to occur on the day of the event is anticipated and  
expected. Therefore, the main activity for the venue manager on the day of an  
event, is checking.  
On the day of the event, the preparation duties of the venue manager are as  
follows.  
• To ensure that the venue is accessible and ready to receive deliveries and the  
set-up crew.  
• To ensure that the venue is ready to receive the client.  
• To ensure that all services and facilities promised and detailed in the venue  
hire contract are delivered and available. 168 event procedures for venues  
• To oversee the delivery of all services and facilities, including catering, staff,  
cleaning, security.  
• To oversee and liaise with all suppliers, providers and contractors.  
• To receive the client, and provide continued and ongoing support and  
guidance.  
• To source and facilitate any last-minute needs.  
• To ensure that fire, health and safety procedures are followed.  
• To ensure that risk assessment actions are upheld.  
• To oversee rehearsals \(and ensure that a rehearsal happens\*\).  
• To conduct the briefing meeting to all venue staff \(and ensure that the brief-  
ing happens\*\).  
• To conduct the final walk-round of the venue before giving permission for  
the doors to open \(and ensure that the final walk-round happens\*\). This is  
to check that all areas are ready, but is also for safety and legal reasons. Fire  
doors must be unlocked; escape routes must be kept clear; emergency light-  
ing must be visible and working; fire-fighting equipment must be in place;  
there should be no trip hazards, such as cables, or dark edges of stages and  
platforms.  
\*Note\: Where a procedure is set in place it must always be followed. The venue man-  
ager is responsible to ensure that procedures do happen. On event days, time can  
often become compressed due to set-up delays or miscalculations as to how long  
things will take. When this happens and there is pressure to open the doors on time,  
it is tempting to forego the rehearsal, or the staff briefing, or the final walk-round –  
but these procedures are inserted for necessity and must never be foregone. The  
purpose of a rehearsal is for the technical crew to practise their cues and timings;  
the staff briefing is to inform the staff of key information; and the final walk-round  
is to ensure that the venue is ready and safe before guests enter. If delays mean the  
doors open late, so be it. It is better to open the doors late than to omit a necessary  
procedure which was deemed important to be on the event schedule. Safety and  
professionalism must not ever be compromised, not even due to time limitations.  
Until the point of the doors opening, the venue manager is in the role of checking  
to ascertain all planned activities have happened.  
Once the doors are open and the event is in progress the operational duties of the  
venue manager are as follows.  
• To check throughout the duration of the event that all services and facilities  
are maintained to set standards. Operational procedures 169  
• To ‘float’ to all areas of the venue to ascertain the success of each delivery or  
understand any issues which may occur.  
• To continuously monitor the legal and safety responsibilities of the venue.  
• To proactively engage with the client and ensure that their expectations are  
being met.  
• Should the client be dissatisfied, the venue manager should rectify the issue  
or monitor the situation so as to deal with the outcome after the event.  
It can be seen how the venue manager continues in the role of checking through-  
out the duration of the event.  
Because a venue manager knows the workings of the venue, it can be easy to get  
involved with the labour of it – especially where help is needed, such as in the  
cloakroom or behind the bar.  
But the role of management is holistic\: it requires overview.  
It would be acceptable to help out to alleviate a problem, but it is not appropriate  
to become a worker.  
A venue manager should be in a position to draft assistance from one area of the  
venue to another; from one department to another so as to alleviate a problem. If  
the cloakroom requires another pair of hands for 15 minutes, a member of staff  
should be drafted in, but it is not the venue manager’s role to work the cloakroom  
for 15 minutes.  
It is important for a venue manager to remain available for all areas and oversee  
the running of an event. It requires continual checking to achieve an understand-  
ing of how the event is running. If a client should be dissatisfied, the situation  
must be addressed, and remedied where possible.  
It may be that a client makes a complaint after their event has happened, which is  
why the venue manager must retain a clear understanding of what is happening  
during the event. This can only be achieved by continual checking and will allow  
the venue manager to foresee a complaint, respond to it, and know whether it is  
legitimate.  
When the doors close and the event is finished, the venue manager enacts the  
post-event procedures \(see Part III\).  
Nothing unplanned should occur in a venue during an event. This is why the  
venue manager must ensure that all procedures are followed and included. If a 170 event procedures for venues  
procedure is omitted \(such as the rehearsal, staff briefing, or final walk-round\)  
the risk of unknown occurrences is much greater.  
Author’s voice box  
I have often been asked *who* is responsible for an event.  
This can become confusing when there is a client *and* a venue manager  
*and* an events organiser all onsite on the day of an event.  
The answer is simple to understand\: everybody working on the event is  
responsible for the success of that event.  
However, it is the venue event manager who carries the greatest burden  
of responsibility. They know what works in the venue and what does  
not. They possess relationships with suppliers, the staff and the security  
team. They possess the skills and knowledge of event management,  
which other involved parties may lack. And they are best placed to rem-  
edy problems quickly and effectively.  
It is teamwork. I have never organised an event on my own.  
The client makes decisions based on advice from the venue manager  
and the event organiser.  
The event organiser makes things happen.  
The venue manager ensures the protection of the venue and everyone  
within it. Chapter 23  
# Get-in and set-up  
# procedure  
On the day of the event, the venue manager will know from the event schedule  
what time the set-up begins.  
It is important for the venue manager to know when the client will arrive onsite,  
and should be available to receive the client. If the one-person management struc-  
ture is being observed, the client will expect the venue manager to be present.  
Clients often arrive to the venue after the get-in because they are not always  
involved with the set-up. So, the venue’s responsibilities could begin before the  
client arrives.  
The venue manager may not be required for the early duties of get-in and set-up,  
and could delegate this to an assistant, the technical manager or a member of se-  
curity. If this is so, it is still the responsibility of the venue manager to ensure that  
the venue is accessible and ready to receive the deliveries and/or set-up crew. The  
delegated person must have possession of the event schedule; must have access to  
the premises; and must be briefed in readiness to oversee the get-in.  
The venue hire contract works both ways – for the venue and for the client. The  
get-in time as stated in the venue hire contract is legally binding. Aside from this  
there is professional expectation. It would be unacceptable, unprofessional, and a 172 event procedures for venues  
breach of contract for a delivery or set-up crew to arrive at a venue which is unready,  
untended or inaccessible at the get-in time. Nobody should be waiting for a get-in  
to a venue – unless the venue is open to the public and the get-in cannot commence  
until the public have vacated the premises, in which case there is a variable to  
overcome and the get-in will wait until the go-ahead is given by the venue manager.  
If a get-in does not go ahead according to the venue hire contract, and the time  
calculated for the set-up is thus compromised, it could compress the time be-  
tween set-up and door-opening. This is where the rehearsal, the staff briefing,  
or the final walk-round get squeezed and are in danger of being omitted. Or the  
doors will open late.  
If the get-in is delayed, the event schedule will become obsolete from the outset.  
All timings thereafter will be askew. And, everybody working the event will know  
that there was an operational issue caused by poor venue management.  
It is worthwhile to note here that if any in-situ elements are not required for the event  
and need to be removed from the venue before the event – furniture, low-hanging  
chandeliers, etc. – they need to be removed before the get-in. If the client has not paid  
for these elements, they should not be in the venue during the hire period.  
Some venues may use the set-up time \(after get-in\) to remove items not required.  
This is acceptable when the set-up of an event is not complicated or extensive.  
In any case, the logistics and timings of removing items from the venue would be  
discussed and agreed with the client prior to the date of the event.  
It is also worth noting that some venues will charge for the removal of unrequired  
items. Perhaps they incur costs for removing light fittings or equipment requiring  
specialist technicians, or they have no storage capacity for unused tables and  
chairs and will incur costs for transportation, labour and temporary storage.  
23.1 Set-up  
If the venue manager is not required onsite for the get-in they will arrive at some  
point during the set-up. The time of arrival of the venue manager will be prear-  
ranged and shown on the event schedule.  
The first role will be to check whether everything is on schedule at this early  
stage. Using the event schedule, the venue manager will check that the deliveries  
have arrived; check that the set-up crew are on schedule; check with the produc-  
tion or technical manager that all is well, so far. Chapter 24  
# Rehearsal procedure  
During set-up, the venue manager will check that the actual timeline is on sched-  
ule and will allow for the rehearsal. This is important to determine because re-  
hearsals can get delayed or even cancelled if time runs out.  
It is the duty of the venue manager to ensure that a rehearsal does take place  
because it is their venue on show and nothing would be worse than a failure on  
stage in full view of the guests. So, even where timings are out, the rehearsal  
must happen – even if this means the doors will open later than planned.  
If there is a stage, there must be a rehearsal. And, whoever is on the stage  
must have rehearsed.  
If there is a band or entertainment, the rehearsal will allow for sound checks so  
that the production crew can adjust sound levels and microphone levels.  
The production crew will also set the lighting levels for the show and the lighting  
engineer will ‘focus’ the lights to create pattern or ‘gobo’ effects and illuminate  
particular spots.  
Where presenters, speakers or presenters of awards are appearing at the event,  
each person must rehearse their slot. This allows for timing adjustments, lighting 174 event procedures for venues  
adjustments and sound adjustments. It also allows each presenter the surprise of  
hearing their own voice channelled through a sound system. Presenters should be  
shown how to hold and speak through a microphone. They should also be made  
aware of camera or photo angles, and where to access and leave the stage.  
A rehearsal is not only for the benefit of people on the stage. It is an essential pro-  
cedure for the production crew, stagehands, cameramen and backstage ‘runners’.  
The production manager will run through the sound and lighting cues so that the  
entire crew have at least one try-out before the show.  
Where recipients of awards are not rehearsing – because they may not be at the  
venue before the event, or the winners are kept secret until they are announced –  
stand-ins play the role of the winners attending the stage to receive their awards.  
This allows the sound engineer, lighting engineer, follow-spot operators and  
camera crews to rehearse following each winner from their designated seat to  
the stage. In addition, rehearsing with stand-ins walking to and from the stage  
enables the production manager to accurately time the show. Chapter 25  
# During-event  
# procedures  
Before the doors open for guests to enter the venue, the venue manager will con-  
duct the staff briefing.  
This briefing meeting should last for 5–10 minutes and no longer than 15 min-  
utes, because staff will be busy preparing for guests to enter.  
The main points to cover in a staff briefing are as follows\:  
• opening and closing times  
• what the event is for  
• introduction of key personnel – venue manager; client; head of security  
• timings, such as when the entertainment will begin, what time dinner is  
served, when the bar will close  
• the location of cloakroom and toilets, so that staff who are unfamiliar with  
the venue can direct guests to these areas when asked.  
The staff are usually briefed as one group for efficiency and consistency, and not  
briefed in departmental groups. This allows for just one briefing, because time  
will be short. If any member of staff has a question, all other staff will hear the 176 event procedures for venues  
answer. Also, it prevents the venue manager from having to repeat information  
or forgetting to say something to one group which they have said to another. In  
addition, if there is a chance that staff will be utilised in other areas – a waiter  
being utilised to help out in the cloakroom, say – one briefing maintains consist-  
ency across the departments.  
25.1 Security briefing  
After the staff briefing, the venue manager may separately brief the security team.  
Security will need to know that the doors do not open until the venue manager  
gives the instruction; not the client nor the event organiser. It is imperative that  
the venue manager conducts the final walk-round, even if it means that the doors  
will open late. The client or the event organiser may not agree with this, but se-  
curity will not open the doors until the venue manager gives approval.  
Also, security need to be briefed about VIPs attending the event and different  
types of identification and access passes. Where areas are distinct – such as hos-  
pitality areas, VIP areas, backstage areas, crew areas – the security personnel  
stationed at these distinct areas must be briefed as to which passes allow access.  
At each distinct area, a poster should be displayed with each type of pass visible  
\(backstage; crew; artistes; VIP; guest; Access All Areas\). There will be a cross through  
the passes which do not allow access to that area. \(Access All Areas passes provide  
unlimited access to all areas of the venue, so will not be crossed out on any poster.\)  
This poster system avoids embarrassment and prevents conflict. The holder of  
the pass can clearly see where they are permitted to attend without having to ask  
security. It also prevents security from having to challenge or embarrass guests.  
And, the posters provide a visual support to security so they cannot be accused of  
making personal or wrong decisions.  
Note\: Access All Areas \(or Triple A or AAA\) passes allow access without restric-  
tion to every area of the venue. However, there may be further stipulation as  
to whether the holder of an Access All Areas pass can escort other parties into  
certain areas. For example, a person with an Access All Areas pass may escort  
somebody with a Hospitality pass to the backstage areas but not the crew areas.  
25.2 Final walk-round  
Before giving the instruction for doors to open, the venue manager will conduct  
the final walk-round. This is a brief but thorough walk around all areas of the  
venue. It is the final check.  
Because the walk-round is the final check, it is the last of the preparation proce-  
dures. This means it happens as the last activity before doors open. During-event procedures 177  
When the venue is ready and it is almost time to open the event to guests, this  
is when the venue manager instructs security to hold the doors closed. The venue  
manager will then conduct the final walk-round.  
The final walk-round can be conducted by the venue manager alone, or with the  
accompaniment of the client, and/or the event organiser, and/or the head of se-  
curity, and/or the head of housekeeping or maintenance. Being accompanied by  
any of these personnel may quicken the procedure if anything requires correcting  
as a result of the final check.  
The purpose of the final walk-round is to check that all areas of the venue are  
ready and safe to receive guests.  
• All areas are clean.  
• No cleaning products have been left behind.  
• No cleaner’s rooms, maintenance rooms or storerooms have been left  
unlocked.  
• Bars are set up and staff are ready.  
• Cloakroom staff are ready.  
• DJ/stage/entertainment is ready.  
• Lighting and sound is in the correct mode to receive guests into the venue.  
• Fire exits are unlocked and unchained.  
• Emergency escape routes are not obstructed.  
• Emergency lighting is not covered by decorations or branding.  
• There are no trip hazards, such as cables, platform edges, legs of tripod stands.  
• The front door is ready to receive guests and the door hosts are in place with  
guest lists.  
If an issue is identified during the final walk-round, it must be remedied before the  
permission is given for security to open the doors. This would usually cause only  
minimal delay or perhaps no delay at all if the walk-round is ahead of schedule.  
After an issue has been identified, the venue manager can continue with the  
walk-round but must always return to the issue to ensure that it has been recti-  
fied. It is easy for somebody to say they will rectify a problem, or to say they have  
taken care of it, but the venue manager must recheck before opening the doors. If  
it was worth checking in the first place, it has to be worth rechecking.  
Only when the final walk-round is complete and the venue manager is satisfied,  
will permission be granted for security to open the doors. 178 event procedures for venues  
Author’s voice box  
Clients will panic when they realise the doors are not going to open on  
time. They see it as some kind of failure. They will be horrified at the  
thought of their invited guests having to wait outside and not be wel-  
comed into the venue on time.  
But, procedures are implemented for good reason and must be fol-  
lowed. In the case of the final walk-round it is for reasons of safety and  
risk. Nothing is more important\: not even opening the doors on time.  
Many times after a hectic set-up and the lights having been dimmed  
into ready mode, I have conducted a final walk-round of the venue and  
come across broken glass; cables strewn across carpets; trip hazards;  
cleaning chemicals left behind; and cleaner’s cupboards left open. I  
have even found fire exits still chained.  
On one occasion, I discovered a rusty metal fitting protruding from a wall.  
There are legal implications to consider, as well as safety, health, pres-  
entation standards and quality, which supersede the need to open the  
doors on time.  
It really is worth keeping guests waiting outside for a short while so as  
to ensure their safety once inside the venue.  
25.3 Opening the doors  
Opening the doors is the moment it has all been for – the doors are open and the  
venue is receiving guests.  
All the preparation and liaison; client meetings; venue visits; all the planning … it has  
come down to this point of opening the doors and allowing guests into the venue.  
The point of entry is where the first problems can arise. The door is where the  
venue manager should take position.  
The entrance can be an area of high activity with guest list, VIP list, press list, the  
press taking photos, door hosts, security checks, passes being checked, tickets or  
invitations being checked, guest drop-offs, guest arrivals, the cloakroom, and the  
service of welcome drinks \(although hopefully not; see section 14.3.1\).  
At the door, the venue manager must check that guests are being welcomed po-  
litely and efficiently into the venue. The flow of guests must be monitored to  
ensure speed of service and that queues are not forming. During-event procedures 179  
Once the venue manager feels confident the entrance is running smoothly, they  
can move to check other areas, but will continue returning to the front door to  
monitor this area until the flow of guests arriving at the venue subsides.  
For the next checks, the venue manager can follow the natural flow of a guest  
entering the venue. The next area to check, then, would be the cloakroom.  
Just like at the front door, it is necessary to monitor the flow of guests. If a queue  
is forming, it could be worthwhile to place additional staff into the cloakroom  
during the busy arrivals period, until the flow of guests slows down.  
The venue manager can leave the front areas to now check how the welcome  
drinks service or bars are operating. Once satisfied that these areas are operating  
well, there should be a return visit to the cloakroom and front door.  
25.4 Checking  
Once arrivals have slowed, the critical period for the front door, cloakroom and  
welcome drinks has passed.  
Now, the venue manager can leave these areas and move into the venue to mon-  
itor the event.  
Using the event schedule as a checklist, each activity can be checked as it is  
scheduled to occur.  
The venue manager should work ahead of the schedule, so as to remain proactive.  
If there is a show, speech or presentation, the venue manager will liaise with the  
production manager before the show is scheduled to begin.  
Ongoing checking of timings and making necessary adjustments is helpful. It  
may be that dinner service is running late, so the show will begin later than  
scheduled. This can be communicated to the production manager.  
Delays and adjusted timings are common with events; it is part of the nature  
of events. The venue manager should be aware of timing variances by using the  
event schedule and measuring how askew the timings are.  
Timing adjustments need to be communicated to the team\: the chef; the produc-  
tion manager; the presenter, speaker, host or entertainment; and maybe the client.  
Where timings do change as the event is progressing, it is good practice to make  
notes on the event schedule. This way the venue manager has a record of when ac-  
tivities actually occurred against the planned timing. If the canapé service is late,  
for example, it will be recorded as such. This information will provide a reminder  
after the event and may help if a complaint is raised. 180 event procedures for venues  
It should be that during the event, the venue manager is checking and monitor-  
ing all operations within the venue\: toilets, bars, catering, technical production,  
cloakroom, security …  
Additionally, the venue manager should frequently meet the client to check that  
expectations are being met. Mere eye contact may be enough. Or observing from  
a distance that the client appears to be enjoying the event. If done correctly, the  
venue manager will be visible to the client in case anything is required, but can  
move on if all is well.  
It is courteous and respectful to demonstrate attentiveness to the client. They  
hold the purse; they make the decision whether to rebook; they enjoy being  
looked after; and all clients have an ego to be massaged.  
The checking procedure is a professional tool to ensure that an event is running  
as had been planned during the lead-in stage. However, it is also the event man-  
ager’s tool should things not go to plan.  
Notes and timing variances should be made on the event schedule for recollection  
after the event.  
At the end of the event, the right-hand tick-column on the event schedule should  
be filled, without gaps, to confirm that every activity had indeed occurred and  
was checked.  
25.5 Catering  
Regardless of whether serving a buffet, a banquet, or straightforward canapés,  
the catering can be a cause for complaint at events.  
It may be a guest or number of guests who complain, or it might be the client who  
was dissatisfied.  
Everybody knows their idea of good food, so everybody has their opinion.  
The problem is that poor catering, or a complaint about catering, harms the repu-  
tation of the venue. Remember, the venue manager must protect the reputation of  
the venue. Yet, catering is the easiest and possibly most common cause of damage  
to a venue’s reputation.  
For this reason, the venue manager must feel confident that the food quality is  
high. This confidence is provided at the early stages of planning the event because  
it will either be in-house catering or external. If it is external \(an outside caterer  
or event caterer\), the venue manager would have recommended which caterer the During-event procedures 181  
client could use from the approved list. If there was not an approved list and the  
client brings in an unknown caterer, the venue manager would have met with  
the caterer, liaised with them, and sampled their food at a menu tasting.  
So, by the date of the event, the quality of catering would be known.  
During the event, the venue manager must ensure that catering standards are  
upheld by closely checking and monitoring as part of the onsite management  
procedures. Carrying out this procedure diligently should have forewarned the  
venue manager of any issues with the catering.  
If a complaint arises, the venue manager will thus be prepared to receive it, and  
may even have already arrived at a solution.  
No less important, is for the venue manager to know whether a complaint is  
legitimate.  
It has been known for clients to ‘invent’ complaints as a tactic to negotiate the  
final invoice. If the venue manager has performed the role of checking every area  
during the event, and is armed with notes and timing variances on the event  
schedule, complaints can be countered and seen as legitimate \(see Section 27.3\).  
25.6 Closing  
There is often a natural ‘wind down’ of an event. This could be determined by  
slowing the pace and style of the music, the end of the band’s set, the closure of  
the bar, or the natural drift of guests exiting the venue.  
Towards the end of an event, the venue manager’s focus should revert to the  
cloakroom and front door. These areas will again become busy and it really is  
very easy to predict.  
At the start of an event, and at the end, guests will want easy entering, easy  
exiting and easy access to the cloakroom. It is a failure of venue management to  
get this wrong.  
The venue manager’s role does not finish at the end of an event. It continues past  
the end of the event. So, what is determined as the ‘end’?  
The ‘end’ is not when the catering has finished. Nor is it when the client leaves  
the venue. Nor is it when the last guest has gone home.  
The job of a venue manager continues through the de-rig and to the get-out. It  
should be noted and understood that a de-rig can be one of the most risk-prone 182 event procedures for venues  
parts of an event \(see Chapter 26\), and venue responsibility only ends when the  
venue is clear.  
Only when the venue is clear, does the venue manager come to the end. But, then  
the post-event procedures kick in.  
Venue management is a social role in a social environment, which requires a  
venue manager to be a social person. The client relationship depends on it. But,  
the job is not to be social. The job is to be professional and attentive; to guide and  
lead; to perform the function of a manager; to take control of situations that may  
occur; to remain aware of hazards; to manage people. To be sober.  
Author’s voice box  
It is not the job of a venue manager to be sipping cocktails with the  
client – even if the ‘end’ of the event is determined as something other,  
such as after the show, and the client is feeling more relaxed.  
A venue manager is at work and is in a position of responsibility and  
authority.  
It is acceptable to sip a cocktail or a glass of champagne with the client  
to be sociable. But I take the drink with me and discreetly deposit it  
elsewhere.  
If anybody were to follow me around at an event, they would find behind  
me a trail of glasses with just one sip taken from each!  
Event guests can be unpredictable, especially as the event wears on. They are in  
an unfamiliar environment and surrounded by temporary installations. Almost  
all events contain alcohol, which increases the risks. This book has already iden-  
tified how guests are not aware of safety and treat their personal safety with  
complacency – they are having a good time. Somebody is required to oversee  
safety and behaviour, and it should be the venue manager who takes this role.  
People are relying on it.  
The job of a venue manager is to minimise or eliminate all risk. This cannot be  
achieved to the highest possible degree if the venue manager is part of the risk. Chapter 26  
# De-rig procedure  
The de-rig occurs at the end of an event, which is why a venue manager must re-  
main attentive – and sober – throughout the event. The de-rig is no less another  
part of an event and, as such, has to be managed.  
In addition, de-rigs are often hazardous, with equipment being dismantled as  
quickly as possible because the crew have finished the event and just want to get  
home.  
Crew are careful with a get-in and set-up because elements required for the event  
have yet to be used and are about to be on view to guests. The de-rig, however,  
comes after elements have been used and guests have departed. The same care  
does not apply at this end of the event. Often, most elements will not be used  
again and get torn down quickly and frenetically.  
Much attention to safety must be devoted to all parts of the event, including the  
hazard-filled de-rig.  
The de-rig – that is the breaking-down of an event – should not ever commence  
until after all guests have exited the venue. The venue manager must not allow a  
client, event organiser or technical crew to commence the de-rig before all guests  
have left. 184 event procedures for venues  
De-rigs are usually noisy and messy \(and crew can be noisy and messy, also\). The  
stage backdrop gets ripped down, the chairs get stacked, the technical crews strip  
their equipment from the venue... These are not activities which guests should  
witness after the care and expense that was spent on the aesthetics of the event.  
A de-rig is a ‘backstage’ activity, and backstage areas are out of sight to guests.  
Author’s voice box  
I never allow the venue to begin a de-rig while guests remain in the  
venue.  
Often, a venue will begin stacking chairs or whipping off cloths from  
tables because they sense the end of the event and are over-keen to  
clear up the place and send the staff home. I find this wholly unprofes-  
sional after the work and expense we all put in to dressing an event and  
making it a wonderful experiential experience for our guests to enjoy.  
If there are guests still onsite, I will stop a venue from fraying the edges  
of my event and exposing what lies beneath.  
Only in the situation of a ‘turn-around’ does a de-rig commence while guests are  
in the venue. A turn-around occurs when a room is used for dual purposes and is  
changed into another format so that the event can continue.  
For example\: after a conference, the conference room can be turned-around to be-  
come the dinner venue for delegates. Usually, the turn-around occurs while the  
guests are absent – while they are changing for dinner, for example.  
Often, wedding venues need to turn-around their space because room is limited.  
So, after the wedding breakfast, guests will be asked to vacate to the gardens or  
the bar. Then, some tables will be cleared from the dancefloor and the DJ will set  
up. Then the guests can return for the celebration party. Part III  
Post-event procedures Chapter 27  
# Post-event procedures  
The period after an event has taken place is where the loose ends are tied up  
and any remaining invoices are settled. Some event organisers call this stage the  
‘wash-up’.  
What is important is the legacy of each event.  
The reputation of the venue is largely measured after an event. So if the post-  
event procedures are left untidy or neglected, this will be the legacy.  
It must be remembered that the events industry is cyclical. Relationships matter  
because they revisit. Every client is a potential repeat client. Suppliers may be  
needed again for a future project. Reputations carry through the industry and  
people do speak to each other. If the after-event procedures and follow-ups, such  
as paying final invoices, are not followed through efficiently, this is how the  
venue will be remembered.  
It can take effort to continue with procedures after an event has taken place.  
This is because of the anti-climax. Often, the client will move onto other things  
at their workplace now that the event is behind them, and it will be tiresome  
for the venue manager to chase the client to push on with completing the last  
procedures. 188 post-event procedures  
For a venue, there may be the next event project and client on which to focus.  
But, all procedures are purposeful, so a venue manager cannot omit any part.  
Each procedure makes up the whole\: the ‘whole’ is the success of an event and  
is only complete when the three stages of event management have been fulfilled.  
1  
Pre-event\: the lead-in, which is the planning stage from the point of receiv-  
ing confirmation to the date of the event.  
2 Onsite\: the operational logistics on the day of the event.  
3 Post-event\: the follow-up and evaluation after the event.  
It would be neglectful to omit the post-event requirements from the three stages  
of ensuring the success of an event. Success can only be measured after the event.  
The post-event stage is the time to measure performance. This is when it can  
be ascertained whether the objectives of the event were met; whether the client  
was satisfied; whether there were any issues that affected the venue or depart-  
ments within the venue; whether the guests enjoyed the experience; what were  
the learnings for future events; and how good a job was done.  
The post-event stage is the learning for the next event.  
The way to gauge the success of an event is not only by the event itself. It would  
be folly to ask guests leaving an event if the event was a success – they would not  
know what the measurements are.  
Asking guests is not a reliable measurement of success – guests will usually wish  
to be polite in their response when asked if they had a good time. If alcohol was  
a component of the event, guests will be buoyed by drink, which makes this an  
even less reliable strategy for measuring success.  
Guests may state that they enjoyed themselves and had a good time, but this  
could be only one objective of the client when deciding to stage an event and  
putting a budget to it. Was the client’s purpose only for guests to have a good  
time? Or were the client’s objectives for the event – the reasons for it – also to  
make money; or to raise funds for a charitable cause; or to promote a product;  
or to launch a product; or to raise their company profile; or to communicate a  
message … ?  
Event objectives are set at the beginning of an event, so the venue manager must  
understand the reasons that the client is choosing to stage the event and putting  
a budget to it. Only after the event, can it be seen whether those objectives were  
met. Post-event procedures 189  
It is polite and courteous to ask guests whether they had a good time as they leave  
the venue. It will also provide a modicum of understanding whether the objec-  
tive of providing guests with a good experience was largely achieved. But, there  
are other strategies to employ which will produce more reliable and structured  
results.  
27.1 Debriefs  
After the event has happened, the venue manager should hold meetings to reflect  
on the event.  
The venue manager will treat debriefs not as the ‘closing chapter’ of an event, but  
the beginning of the preparations for this client’s next event, should there be one  
\(and there is always potential for a repeat booking\).  
Debriefs provide the venue manager with a further sales opportunity. And, if  
something did go wrong with the last event, the debrief is the procedure which  
can lead to the recovery.  
27.1.1 Venue debrief  
After each event, the venue manager should hold a debriefing meeting with the  
heads of department to ascertain their views about the smooth running of the  
event.  
If the event was routine, the venue debrief may be swift. It may even be tempting  
to forego this debrief after a few events have happened at the venue. But this is  
another procedure which makes up the ‘whole’ of creating a successful event, so  
a debrief must happen every time.  
However routine an event may seem, there might always be something different  
or which happened differently. Each client will be different, for sure. So it is good  
practice to sit down with the heads of department and obtain their insights as to  
the success of an event.  
The real purpose of the venue debrief is to identify problem areas and learn from  
them so that they are not repeated. This is the learning.  
If a department reports an issue, the procedures can be adapted for future  
events, and the venue manager needs to evolve this learning for the sake of self-development,  
professionalism, the success of future events, and the ongoing rep-  
utation of the venue. 190 post-event procedures  
Also, venue debriefs provide a forum for the venue manager to be made aware of  
any issue that arose during an event so that it is known before the client raises it  
during the client debrief \(see section 27.1.2\). This is why the venue debrief hap-  
pens before the client debrief.  
27.1.2 Client debrief  
The purpose of the client debrief meeting is to ascertain and ensure that the  
client was satisfied and their expectations were met. A venue manager will also  
wish to know that the event objectives were met.  
The level of client satisfaction may already be known to a certain extent because  
the venue manager would have been liaising with the client during the event.  
Sometimes, however, a client will appear to be enjoying themselves because it  
may not be appropriate to raise an issue during the event, or they do not wish to  
be seen to be making a fuss.  
The venue manager would usually receive some feedback from the client as they  
leave the venue, or by phone or email the day after the event.  
The venue manager should therefore possess a reasonable idea of the client’s level  
of satisfaction with the event.  
Even so, it is necessary to ensure that the client debrief does happen for deeper  
and more structured feedback after a short period of reflection. The client debrief  
also helps to continue the client relationship, so that it does not cease at the end  
of the event. Furthermore, this debrief provides a sales opportunity for repeat  
business.  
This meeting allows the client relationship to be extended past the event and  
towards any possible event in the future.  
Any opportunity to extend the client relationship and win repeat business or  
referral business should be sought, and the client debriefing meeting is the most  
obvious means.  
If the event was successful, the client debrief meeting will be cordial and relaxed.  
If there was an issue, the meeting will provide a conduit to discuss and settle the  
matter.  
This is why the client debrief should be pre-scheduled\: it is not enough to adopt  
the attitude that ‘everything went well’ so a meeting is not needed. Or, there was Post-event procedures 191  
an issue which ‘I do not want to deal with’. If the meeting is already in the diary,  
it will happen.  
If there was an issue during the event, of which the venue manager is unaware,  
the client debrief meeting provides the opportunity for the client to discuss it  
with the venue manager directly, rather than complain to other parties.  
If the venue manager is already aware of an issue because it was identified during  
the checking procedures at the event, or an issue was raised at the venue debrief  
with the heads of department, a solution can be found before the client debrief  
happens.  
If a client complains after an event and the issue was not known about via the  
checking procedures or the venue debrief, the complaint may not be legitimate.  
This is why the venue debrief happens first, and why the onsite checking proce-  
dures are crucial. The venue manager should be cautious if, after all these proce-  
dures, a client raises a new issue that has not already been identified.  
It may be that guests have raised an issue to the client and the venue manager  
would not know this.  
But it might be that the client is creating an issue or exaggerating it as leverage  
against outstanding invoices. There are ways of dealing with client complaints,  
which are set out in Section 27.3.  
The client debriefing should be considered as a social interaction to close the  
event. The meeting has its purpose and objectives, but should come across to the  
client as a gesture of hospitality.  
It can take place at the venue or at the client’s office, which would possibly be  
more formal. Or it could take place in a social environment, such as a restaurant,  
which would help with discussing potential future business.  
All debrief meetings should be scheduled on the event schedule so that the heads  
of department and the client anticipate them happening and can prepare for  
them. It also helps with diary planning.  
If debriefs are not pre-scheduled, there is a risk they may get omitted after the  
event has happened and everybody has moved on to other projects.  
The venue debrief would happen the day after an event; the client debrief should  
happen within one week of the event. 192 post-event procedures  
27.2 Guest satisfaction evaluation  
Events have many objectives and reasons for happening. Whatever the objectives  
and reasons, all events are for entertaining people. Every event has the objective  
for guests to have a good experience – even if the event is for a serious cause.  
A client will want to know whether their event was judged a success by the people  
who attended.  
A venue needs to know that people enjoyed themselves and had the best possible  
experience at the venue.  
Such feedback is essential for improving and evolving facilities, services and pro-  
cedures. This measurement and understanding is how venues grow success.  
It is always valuable to evaluate guest satisfaction.  
It has become common practice to email a short questionnaire either to all at-  
tendees or a sample proportion of them.  
So, even when guests appear all smiles as they leave the event, and if the door  
staff report that every guest left happy, a questionnaire is still necessary to obtain  
opinions which are reflective and structured.  
Besides, a questionnaire allows for specific questions to be asked and for the  
guest to reply in a considered manner. And, it would not be appropriate nor ac-  
ceptable to delay a guest by asking questions as they are leaving an event.  
A post-event questionnaire should be sent to guests the day after the event. This  
is necessary so as to obtain honest feedback while the event is fresh in the mind  
of the guest. Also, it is important to have received the feedback and analyse the  
results before the client debrief meeting.  
The questions asked within a questionnaire depend upon the information required  
by the client, venue and sometimes the event organiser. No more than ten questions  
is deemed appropriate because a questionnaire must be quick to complete. If a ques-  
tionnaire is longer there will be fewer responses, because people have had the expe-  
rience of the event and cannot be bothered with a lengthy questionnaire afterwards.  
Ideally, the guest feedback questionnaire would be designed prior to the event  
and will have been circulated to the other management parties for their input.  
It may be that one manager wishes to insert questions pertinent to their area of  
responsibility – the chef may wish to insert question about the food, perhaps. Post-event procedures 193  
The questionnaire should reflect the objectives of the event, so that by the time  
the feedback is received, it provides the measure of whether the objectives were  
in fact met.  
Preparing the questions in advance ensures that this procedure is not forgotten  
or omitted after the event. It also allows for consideration of what to ask on the  
questionnaire and which guests will receive it.  
Questions to consider for a guest feedback questionnaire may include the following.  
• Did you have difficulty finding the venue?  
• Do you think the venue was suitable for this event? Why/why not?  
• Do you feel that the staff were friendly and helpful?  
• Did you have to queue at the cloakroom/toilets/bar/buffet?  
• How do you rate the quality of food?  
• Please name three sponsors that you saw represented at the event.  
• Please name three brands that you saw represented at the event.  
• Did you enjoy the entertainment?  
• What time did you leave the event?  
• Would you attend this event again?  
• Would you attend this venue again?  
• Did you find the event to be good value for money?  
• What did you most enjoy at the event?  
• What did you least enjoy at the event?  
• What other comments would you like to make regarding your experience at  
this event?  
The questionnaire may also be used as a sales tool – such as the question asking  
whether the guest would attend this event again. If the response is ‘yes’, then an  
invitation or booking form can be sent out for next year’s event.  
In many cases, a client will want to send the questionnaire themselves because  
they are likely to possess the contact details of attendees. Remember, the ques-  
tionnaire must be sent according to ‘confirmed arrivals’. It would not be profes-  
sional to send a questionnaire to guests who did not attend the event, even if they  
had said they would attend. 194 post-event procedures  
If the client wants control over the questionnaire, the venue manager will need  
to ask for a few questions to be inserted which directly relate to the performance  
of the venue.  
All post-event procedures should be completed quickly and with a sense of ur-  
gency. Otherwise, complacency sets in and it will take yet greater effort for other  
parties to assist with these procedures.  
27.3 Problem solving  
The one key to solving problems is communication.  
Poor communication exacerbates difficult situations.  
It is not good management to ignore an issue or avoid a client’s phone calls and  
emails. Face to face communication is always the best way to resolve problems –  
and if the client briefing has been pre-scheduled it encourages face-to-face prob-  
lem solving.  
Even where a client briefing is not scheduled, a problem provides the reason to  
now arrange a client debrief meeting to discuss a solution.  
The potential here is to identify the issue, work towards a solution, and  
recover the client relationship.  
It should be kept in mind that the reputation of a venue is paramount. Venues  
must protect their reputation. This requires past clients to be loyal and speak  
favourably. Avoiding a problem is the easiest way to wreck a reputation\: the op-  
portunity is to work together with the client towards a resolution.  
Referrals and repeat business are essential to the success of a venue. This is where  
the pre-scheduled client debrief becomes valuable.  
If there are no issues after the event it is a social follow-up meeting.  
If there happens to be an issue it forces the two parties together to seek a solution.  
Either way, the client debrief provides a channel of communication and dialogue.  
Where there is a problem, communication and dialogue is the only way forward.  
It is all about recovering that vital client relationship.  
When emotions and prejudices are put aside, solutions become visible. Post-event procedures 195  
Author’s voice box  
Any of my clients who felt they had an issue with their event were those  
clients who became my repeat clients or long-standing friends.  
This was down to the extra effort needed for me to resolve a situation  
and avoid conflict. Protecting or recovering the client relationship is al-  
ways the goal.  
After all the hard work that goes into planning an event, and the deal-  
ings with the client, and the physical effort onsite at the event itself, it  
would be tragic to fall at the last hurdle by not maintaining the client  
relationship after the event has happened.  
This is where the client debrief has proved so valuable – I wouldn’t end  
an event without it.  
The best form of defence is the tenacity of liaising, checking and monitoring  
during the event. A venue manager must feel confident – and be honest about it –  
that everything which occurred during the event was planned and was executed  
to the highest standard.  
Even where standards fall short – perhaps through no fault of the venue – the  
venue manager will know about it through the onsite checking procedures.  
It has already been noted in this book that some clients may ‘create’ issues before  
settling the final invoices. For this reason, many venues insist there are no out-  
standing payments before the event takes place. This is a protection mechanism,  
but it does not rule out complaints and arguments.  
In any situation, the venue manager needs to be aware of the good and bad of an  
event.  
It is easier to find solutions if the complaint is legitimate – not because the solu-  
tions are easier, but because otherwise mistrust enters the equation. Mistrust  
causes emotional barriers. But, whether a complaint is legitimate or not, the  
venue manager must resolve the situation and recover the client relationship.  
Solutions begin with dialogue. It is important to understand the client’s point of view.  
It is also helpful to ascertain what the client would like to compensate for the issue. 196 post-event procedures  
A venue manager should not use blame as a reason for falling short of expecta-  
tions. It can be easy to blame other departments, suppliers, attendees, or even the  
client. Blame does not resolve an issue. Rather, it exacerbates an issue by causing  
conflict and defensiveness.  
After blame, the next way of dealing with a complaint will be to offer discounts to  
compensate the client. Remember, this could be what the client is searching for.  
A discount from the invoice can placate a client, but it will not resolve an issue –  
and it will impact on profit to the venue. So, discounts are a way of keeping the  
client quiet without providing a real solution.  
The venue could waive the bill and provide a facility or service for free – ­ complimentary,  
or ‘comping’ the bill. Like discounting, it pacifies a client but does not provide a  
­ solution. It will also impact on profit to the venue.  
If a venue discounts or comps its services on a regular basis, it risks creating the  
reputation of poor service because it is not working to find solutions to resolve  
its issues. The issues are still present and are likely to be repeated. Venues which  
routinely discount and comp because of complaints are those that rarely reflect  
on how to improve their service.  
Once word spreads that this venue is cheaper if a complaint is lodged, clients may  
take the opportunity to invent issues in the certain knowledge they will receive  
a discount or get the bill waived. Perhaps the venue will receive business from  
clients for this very reason.  
This form of problem solving is not sustainable. Eventually, the reputation will  
be harmed, the quality of clients will deteriorate, staff morale will decline, profit  
margins will be compromised and the business will close.  
It is a solution to offer a discount or comp for a client’s next event, rather than doing  
so for an event which has already happened and there is no opportunity to correct it.  
This way, the venue provides itself with the opportunity to put things right and  
demonstrate how wonderful things can be, while the client receives the solution  
they were looking for \(only it is in advance\).  
The venue manager will need to assure the client that they will receive exemplary  
standards and service next time – so long as this can be delivered. Usually, a  
venue will take note of what went wrong and then go to extra effort to ensure that  
the second experience surpasses the first.  
Clients who do respond to discounts or comps can be swayed to receive this bene-  
fit in advance of their next event. It is an incentive to return to a venue and receive  
an exceptional service for a lesser budget. Post-event procedures 197  
If the client relationship procedures discussed in this book have been followed,  
a client will provide the venue manager with the benefit of belief that their next  
event will be excellent. And it must be.  
Just because a rebooking is discounted, the venue must not compromise its com-  
mitment of facilities and services, even if it does impact on profit margins. The  
venue must remember why the discount was offered in the first place.  
Sometimes, a venue will take a booking which has a restricted budget or they will  
agree to take a booking as a corporate or personal favour. Even so, the venue took  
the choice to accept the booking and must not provide a ‘discounted service’ to  
the client. It is not fair to the client and is harmful to the reputation of the venue\:  
would the guests know that this was a discounted booking?  
A venue’s commitment to exemplary standards of service and professionalism  
must never fall short.  
When a client rebooks a venue, procedures must already have been tightened so  
that a negative experience is not repeated. It is the procedures which determine  
the success of an event, so they should be revisited, amended, followed, and never  
omitted for any reason.  
The real solution to a complaint is to understand the cause of an issue. Then,  
adjust procedures to ensure that this issue cannot occur again. Eliminate the risk.  
If a procedure can be tightened, it means the procedure was not tight enough. So,  
the complaint was legitimate.  
Author’s voice box  
There was a wedding where it became apparent on the day that the  
registrar had not been booked to officiate the legality of the marriage.  
The only way to get around this was to continue with the wedding and  
conduct the ceremony with a guest playing the role of registrar.  
The entire event was played out, including the ceremony, photographs,  
wedding breakfast, evening disco and buffet. The only thing missing  
was the registrar – which meant that the couple were not legally married.  
The venue may not consider they were at fault because it is only the  
bride and groom who can book the registrar. Besides, the venue had  
asked the couple if they had booked the registrar and were assured  
they had. 198 post-event procedures  
However, a venue has a responsibility to ensure that nothing can go  
wrong at an event. This is elimination of risk. So it is not enough to ask  
the couple, but the venue must check the evidence that the registrar  
has been booked.  
Clients are allowed to be forgetful or unprofessional. But a venue  
is in the business of event management and is responsible for the  
success of the event. It must not rely on clients to do any part of the  
job – especially wedding clients, who might lack the skills and knowl-  
edge of events. It is the venue’s responsibility to guide and advise  
their clients, and guarantee that nothing can go wrong with their  
most important day.  
After this case, the venue revised its procedures to ensure that the situ-  
ation could not happen again. This also suggests to me that the venue  
was at fault because if there was any room to amend their procedures, it  
seems the procedures were not tight enough beforehand.  
Apart from the obvious problems with this situation, there is an issue  
of damage to the reputation of the venue. The couple are unlikely to  
tell everybody that it was their mistake. Additionally, the guests who  
attended will assume it was the venue’s mistake.  
All those guests will be talking about the wedding they attended at that  
venue which forgot to book the registrar and the couple had to pretend  
to be married!  
27.4 Final report \(Appendix iv\)  
Every event is a learning curve for whoever is involved in its planning and  
execution.  
Whatever is learnt may be in the head, but brains do forget things – especially  
if the event does not recur for a year, or if a similar event occurs in three years’  
time. It is good practice, therefore, to make a record of the lessons from each  
event on a Final Report.  
Appendix IV provides an example of a final report, but the main points to include  
are as follows. Post-event procedures 199  
• The venue manager’s copy of the event schedule with notes, timing changes  
and checklist.  
• A report of the objectives of the event and how each was met.  
• A report of the venue debrief.  
• A report of the client debrief.  
• Notes on the client – their likes/dislikes/interests/personal notes.  
• A list of suppliers involved with this event.  
• Notes of what went particularly well.  
• Notes of what did not go so well.  
• Notes of any issues.  
• Notes of any adjustments to procedures and the reasons.  
• What to remember if this client were to rebook.  
• What to remember if this event were to recur.  
People move on to other jobs, so a professional venue manager would want the  
final report to provide information for anybody following in the same role. There  
is a legacy to consider after leaving one position for another, but also the venue  
will continue with its reputation and if it suffers in future it will not contribute to  
good standing on a curriculum vitae.  
A venue must benefit from the learning, as well as the individual. The individual  
can take their learning to another job. The venue cannot do this and that should  
not be its disadvantage.  
Also, if the client rebooks the venue it will be because the venue manager had  
made a success of the previous event. A professional venue manager will want his  
client to benefit from what went before.  
The idea of the final report is that anybody in the future – including the same  
venue manager, of course – could get a good idea of what happened at that pre-  
vious event.  
This is valuable when a client rebooks or a similar event occurs and this docu-  
ment is retrieved in such cases. The final report can thus be placed into the new  
Client File to guide the venue manager through the process of planning the next  
event. 200 post-event procedures  
Also, if an enquiry is received for a similar event, information on the final report  
can assist with responding to the enquiry or building the proposal – menus; costs;  
suppliers.  
The final report is the last procedure of venue management and is the final doc-  
ument in the Client File. When this form is complete it closes the file. This is the  
true ‘end’ of an event.  
Happy eventing! Chapter 28  
# Case studies  
cAse study 1 by Philip Berners\: the London  
Hippodrome  
Venue  
The London Hippodrome, Leicester Square, London, England  
Profile  
A large capacity venue for up to 1,000 guests in a high-profile location  
in Leicester Square at the centre of London’s theatre, cinema and enter-  
tainment district.  
In the 1980s, the venue was extremely successful as a nightclub un-  
der the stewardship of Peter Stringfellow and became the top London  
nightspot. Pop stars and celebrities of the day frequented the club, in-  
cluding Princess Diana.  
After Stringfellow left the club in the 1990s, the London Hippodrome  
continued as a busy nightclub using its renowned name. It soon settled  
into being a lacklustre yet still very busy nightclub for foreign tourists. 202 Case studies  
Brief  
My brief was to develop the opportunity of secondary income by host-  
ing events during daytime hours when the nightclub was closed, and on  
slow trading nights, such as Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  
Negatives  
Poor reputation; perception as an outdated nightclub which only tour-  
ists visit but Londoners do not. A venue that was known for being a  
nightclub, not an events venue. Key words\: dated; seedy; tacky; dark.  
Positives  
Exciting location close to the Odeon for film premières. A recognis-  
able landmark building. A large capacity venue. Impressive in-house  
sound and light systems. In-house projection. A hydraulic stage with lift  
launch. Car access from street to stage. Tiered auditorium. Balconies.  
Dance floor. Large backstage areas, kitchens and dressing rooms  
Strategy  
The management were entirely focused on the business of running a  
busy central London nightclub. But there was a need to differentiate  
between the venue trading as a nightclub and as a corporate venue.  
The service to corporate clients needed to be rebranded, repackaged  
and launched to the corporate marketplace. Most especially, the han-  
dling of corporate clients needed to be professional.  
Procedures were instigated that would meet the expectations and  
needs of corporate clients. These included the following.  
• Direct phone line to the event manager’s desk, so as to divert event  
enquiries from the untrained nightclub receptionist.  
• New corporate stationery to differentiate the events department  
from the nightclub’s profile.  
• Reinvigorated attention to detail and cleanliness.  
• Implementation of professional procedures, including enquiry han-  
dling and booking procedures, show-rounds, operational event  
management and standard operating procedures. Case studies 203  
• Implementation of effective interdepartmental communication  
procedures.  
• Repositioning of the brand extension at venue exhibitions.  
• Introduction of promotion evenings to get potential clients into the  
venue and demonstrate the facilities and scope for corporate events.  
• Design and print new corporate brochure with technical specifica-  
tions and images of events.  
Results  
Success in the corporate event marketplace shed the old image and  
achieved the perception of the London Hippodrome as a serious  
venue for high-profile events.  
Clients could rely on professionalism and dedication when they  
booked their event into the London Hippodrome.  
The organisation culture shifted and all departments worked towards  
making corporate events successful.  
The contribution to the core business increased from four events a  
year to over 100.  
cAse study 2 by Philip Berners\: Thorpe Park  
Venue  
Thorpe Park, Surrey, England  
Profile  
A high-profile theme park west of London. The venue has water rides  
and rollercoasters, is the second most popular theme attraction in the  
UK and the tenth most visited theme park in Europe, with 1.9 million  
visitors per year.  
The park covers 500 acres with six areas for private corporate hire. 204 Case studies  
Brief  
To lead the events department, oversee the department’s demerger  
from the entertainments department, grow the contribution from cor-  
porate events to the core business.  
Negatives  
Events was a division of the entertainments department, which diluted  
the emphasis of corporate events. Corporate events were run along-  
side the theme park, rather than as a standalone division. Resistance to  
events by many of the 600 staff. The theme park was closed during the  
winter months.  
Positives  
Opportunity to demerge the events department, restructure it and  
grow it. Attractions for corporate activities, events and fun days in situ.  
High-profile destination. Six areas available for corporate hire. Pictur-  
esque site. Celebrity attendance. Continual investment and upgrading  
of facilities. Extremely professional support departments, such as mar-  
keting and public relations.  
Strategy  
To reposition the events department and raise its profile, both internally  
among the management and staff, and externally to the corporate  
marketplace.  
• Create an events division with direct phone lines, corporate station-  
ery, dedicated catering and hospitable show-rounds.  
• Extend the reach of Thorpe Park to local clients and London clients  
by exhibiting at international venue exhibitions.  
• Extend the range of events, to include corporate fun days; bar-  
becues; meetings; conferences; private hire evenings; trade fairs;  
Christmas craft fair; exhibitions; car shows; Christmas parties; boat  
shows on the lakes.  
• Implementation of effective internal communications to integrate  
events with the staff that were affected by the alteration of daily  
park procedures. Case studies 205  
Results  
Significant growth of income from events. The increased contribution  
to the core business shifted the organisation culture and allowed more  
funding to be directed to the standalone events department.  
Increased attention for events and funding allowed the development  
and increase of corporate venues within the theme park.  
The shift in organisation culture changed the attitude of managers and  
staff, who began to embrace events.  
The instigation of effective interdepartmental communication brought  
about a change in acceptance of corporate events.  
The increase in creative and exciting events motivated the staff and  
management.  
Significant growth of the events department and team.  
The events department became the sole department to operate over  
the closed winter months, making events the only department bringing  
income into the business when the theme park was closed and other-  
wise not achieving revenue.  
cAse study 3 by Dimitri Lera\: a wedding in Tuscany  
Venue  
La Cervara, Portofino, Tuscany, Italy  
A key skill with venue management and organising events is the pe-  
dantic attention to detail. You’ve heard it before\: details need to be  
checked, over and over again. This case study demonstrates how and  
why attention to detail is crucial.  
One of the perks of organising events in Italy is the abundance of his-  
torical sites that are perfect venues for all sorts of events. This wedding  
was taking place in a former monastery at La Cervara on the western  
Ligurian coast, about half an hour’s drive from Genoa, in Portofino. 206 Case studies  
The monastery was founded in 1361 and dedicated to San Girolamo.  
The prestige of San Girolamo della Cervara and its magnificent posi-  
tion made it the preferred destination of many illustrious personalities,  
whose visits are recorded in local journals. Items that form the décor  
have a high value, including rare books, artworks, tapestries and fine  
furniture. La Cervara monastery rests on a steep cliff overlooking the  
sea. It has been described as ‘an epiphany for the spirit’.  
I was in the position of food and beverage manager with a focus on  
events, and in this particular instance we were preparing an evening  
wedding dinner on the outside veranda of La Cervara. The veranda is  
large enough to seat 100 guests and overlooks the magnificent gulf of  
Portofino.  
The event was taking place on a Saturday evening, as most weddings do  
in Italy. This allows for the event to carry on into the late hours, enabling  
guests to enjoy music, dancing and drinks surrounded by friends and  
the fantastic scenery, contributing to the memorable experience.  
A converted abbey, the venue extends over three storeys. The veranda  
is on the ground floor with arched vaulted doors linking to a long corri-  
dor that runs the length of the entire building. On the first floor there is  
an adapted kitchen and a series of common rooms, including drawing  
rooms and a library. The second floor accommodates suites and apart-  
ments for overnight guests.  
Unfortunately, the kitchen extractors had stopped working the week  
before the event. It was discussed whether to bring in a marquee  
to house a satellite kitchen, but this was deemed as an unnecessary  
expense – especially as the weather forecast confirmed clear weather  
and in Italy the weather is fairly reliable. Therefore, arrangements were  
made to house a satellite kitchen in the cloister at the back of the build-  
ing, which was close enough to serve food to guests, but secluded  
enough for the fumes of the grilled dishes to disperse in the woods that  
border the cloister. It was thought to be the ideal solution.  
The day of the event went well until a light wind brought a sudden  
shower. For my peace of mind, I went to check the drawing room up-  
stairs. To my surprise, I noticed that smoke was quickly filling the room.  
Somebody from the chef brigade had opened a downstairs door in  
order for the smoke from the grilling to dissipate from the temporary  
kitchen, allowing it to drift upstairs. An antique book that smells like a  
steak loses its value very quickly! Some of the book covers are made of Case studies 207  
treated leather, and it takes a lengthy and costly procedure to eliminate  
unpleasant odours. Fortunately, I had entered the drawing room early  
enough to avoid any serious damage. I returned downstairs, closed the  
door and ensured that the chef brigade were informed of the problem  
and would not repeat the error.  
This example shows the need to continually check all details and all ar-  
eas of the venue during the event – not only during the planning and  
build stages. Just by the simple act of checking, I prevented major  
costly consequences. Appendix I
