en tiie nA Series preface  
The events industry, including festivals, meetings, conferences, exhibitions, incentives, sports and a  
range of other events, is rapidly developing and makes a significant contribution to business and  
leisure related tourism. With increased regulation and the growth of government and corporate  
involvement in events, the environment has become much more complex. Event managers are now  
required to identify and service a wide range of stakeholders and to balance their needs and objec-  
tives. Though mainly operating at national levels, there has been significant growth of academic  
provision to meet the needs of events and related industries and the organizations that comprise  
them. The English speaking nations, together with key Northern European countries, have devel-  
oped programs of study leading to the award of diploma, undergraduate and post-graduate  
awards. These courses focus on providing education and training for future event professionals,  
and cover areas such as event planning and management, marketing, finance, human resource  
management and operations. Modules in events management are also included in many tourism,  
leisure, recreation and hospitality qualifications in universities and colleges.  
The rapid growth of such courses has meant that there is a vast gap in the available literature on  
this topic for lecturers, students, and professionals alike. To this end, the Elsevier Butterworth-  
Heinemann Events Management Series has been created to meet these needs to create a planned  
and targeted set of publication in this area.  
Aimed at academic and management development in events management and related studies, the  
Events Management Series\:  
¢ provides a portfolio of titles which match management development needs through various  
stages;  
\* prioritizes publication of texts where there are current gaps in the market, or where current pro-  
vision is unsatisfactory;  
¢ develops a portfolio of both practical and stimulating texts;  
e provides a basis for theoretical and research underpinning for programs of study;  
\* is recognized as being of consistent high quality,  
° will quickly become the series of first choice for both authors and users. -

Hope is NOT an Action Plan  
In August 2005 a two-day risk management workshop was held in Johannesburg, South Africa that  
brought together representatives from the event industry and regulatory authorities to examine and  
discuss the obligations and opportunities for effective and efficient compliance and quality assurance  
in the area of safe and secure planned public events. The attendees reviewed existing legalities and the  
proposed legislation related to the production of public events, South Africa’s Safety and Security at  
Events Bill, and discussed the compliance challenges faced by event organizers and the enforcement  
challenges faced by regulatory agencies. One of the outcomes of the workshop was a draft of a ten-  
point charter for a Code of Professional Conduct for Safe Events.  
1 Dono harm  
2 Conduct business in a safe and responsible manner  
3 Meet or exceed the standard of care exemplified by best practices in the worldwide events  
industry  
4 Identify and access all appropriate reference resources  
5 Require training, research, and continuous professional development from all role players,  
including but not limited to staff, volunteers, suppliers, sponsors, and others  
6 Cause a risk assessment to be performed by a competent person for all events  
7 Require prior to the start of any live event a public announcement describing appropriate  
egress and evacuation steps  
8 Each and every event will maintain a life safety plan  
9 Life safety plans will be reviewed, updated, and communicated prior to the installation of an  
event  
10 Continually develop and maintain currency in all of the above  
This proposed Code of Professional Conduct for Safe Events illustrates that a commitment to  
safety must be made by everyone involved in the planning and production of the event project.  
Event risk management is a comprehensive process that must be fully integrated and embedded  
into all the event plans and throughout the event management process. It is the duty of every meet-  
ing or event organizer, producer, manager, supplier, and participant, and it involves the protection  
of people, property, information, and other event assets to ensure a safe, successful, and sustain-  
able event.  
This duty is being addressed by governments throughout the world and often mandated  
through legislation enacted to protect the health and safety of their citizenry. For example, the  
Australian Capital Territory \(ACT\) Occupational Health and Safety Council made the following  
recommendation in its 2005 report on the Scope and Structure Review of the Occupational Health  
and Safety Act 1989. 2 \_\_e EEEETEEE EERE EIREEEREERIEEEER Ea  
xviii Preface  
Given the whole-of-government arrangements for public events is a matter which goes beyond the  
issues of workplace safety and ACT WorkCover’s specific responsibilities, the Council recom-  
mends the Government examine the following options\:  
public events legislation;  
agency services coordination;  
guidance material or a code of practice; and  
industry accreditation of event organizers.  
It is clear that the level of expected professionalism is getting higher and the penalties for not meeting  
these requirements will, no doubt, increase in frequency and severity. This is not to say that profes-  
sional event organizers have ignored this duty; they have been actively seeking this guidance mate-  
rial. Risk management is consistently identified in needs assessment surveys as an area of professional  
weakness, and practitioner community members regularly request sample forms or checklists from  
each other to help them perform the risk management functions they know they should be conduct-  
ing. What meeting and event management professionals need are clear, concise, and practical tools  
that will assist them in managing the exposure to the possibility of loss, damages, or injuries arising  
from uncertainties that surround their events and event operations. They want effective strategies for  
making and carrying out decisions that maximize the potential of favorable outcomes and that mini-  
mize the adverse effects of potential losses.  
This book examines the practices, procedures, and safeguards associated with the identification,  
analysis, response planning, and control of the risks surrounding events of all types, and provides a  
solid conceptual foundation based on proven risk management techniques; effective strategies for  
managing the risks associated with the design, planning, and production of public and private  
events; and ready-to-use tools designed specifically for meeting and event organizers.  
Part One lays the foundation for understanding risk management by reviewing the role of risk  
management for meetings and events and then examining the risk management process and the

tools and techniques used for identifying, analyzing, responding to, monitoring, controlling, and  
documenting risks within a comprehensive risk management plan.  
; Part Two examines the scope of risk management beginning with the legal and ethical responsibili-  
ties necessary to ensure an event operation is in compliance with all applicable statutory requirements  
and ethical practices. This is followed by an investigation of the health and safety issues and regula-  
tory requirements facing meetings and events. The principles of loss prevention and security are dis-  
cussed from the perspective of human and property protection, fiscal responsibility, and the effective  
deployment of personnel and equipment. Emergency preparedness is explored so that the proper con-  
tingency, crisis management, and disaster recovery plans may be developed.  
Part Three examines the organizational safeguards that may be employed to protect the assets of  
an event and an event organization, and the policies and procedures that ensure effective and effi-  
cient risk management endeavors. The integration of risk management into the administrative activ-  
ities and the event's organizational structure is demonstrated using project management techniques.  
The effective management of the acquisition and dissemination of information is reviewed so a com-  
munications strategy may be incorporated into the risk management plan and process. The role,  
objectives, and activities included in the marketing of a meeting or event are discussed from both a  
risk and crisis management viewpoint.  
Part Four addresses the operational safeguards that will be necessary to make certain the risks  
surrounding the meeting or event program and its production are managed appropriately. The  
design of the meeting or event program is examined so that all its elements and activities may be  
properly assessed for inherent hazards or vulnerabilities that must be incorporated into the risk  
management plan. Site selection, inspection, layout, and development strategies are reviewed so  
that a safe and secure environment may be created to accommodate the audience and activities.  
The formulation of suitable attendee admittance and crowd management plans are discussed  
based on predicted and probable human behavioral patterns.  
Interspersed throughout the chapters are case study examples from a variety of event genre around  
the world that illustrate risk situations that have occurred and emphasize the importance of risk man-  
agement in the meeting and event industry. Concluding each chapter is a section providing a chapter  
review challenge set of questions and a practical risk management exercise that will reinforce the con-  
cepts discussed, plus a glossary of definitions and the key terminology in the chapter as well as online  
resources that should be useful for further investigation of the topics covered. Appendices include a  
variety of practical forms and worksheets suitable for immediate application to real life meeting and  
event projects that will serve an array of event types, sizes, and contexts.  
Events of all types are produced every day for all manner of purposes and attracting all sorts of peo-  
ple who come together for deliberation, celebration, worship, entertainment, reunion, commerce, edu-  
cation, enrichment, and/or amusement. Creating and managing the environment in which these  
people will gather carries with it obligations — legal, ethical, and financial obligations to provide a safe  
and secure setting and to operate in a manner that ensures the hosting organizations or individuals  
achieve their objectives in a proper and profitable way.  
A combination of education and experience leads to professional maturity and the ability to  
properly use the tools, techniques, and strategies for making good risk management decisions. It is  
my belief that this book will become a valuable resource for students and practitioners throughout  
their careers, and will inspire meeting and event management professionals to approach risk man-  
agement as diligently and creatively as any other aspect of creating and producing quality events,  
relying on proper risk planning, assessment, response, and control practices rather than hope as  
their action plan for safe, secure, and sustainable events.  
As event professionals we are not only creating experiences, making dreams come true; we are

Learn from everyone  
The collective wealth of knowledge in this industry is astounding and no single person can claim  
absolute expertise. Making an attempt to capture a portion of that wealth of knowledge in a book  
can never be attributed to a single person either. This book is the result of an amazing group of peo-  
ple who have shared their stories, provided their expertise, and offered invaluable guidance for  
this project. My deepest thanks go out to the following individuals for their contributions and  
unyielding support. I have learned so much from each and every one of them.

I would also like to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of individuals who have been injured or  
lost their lives at events, from whom I trust we have all learned the seriousness of risk management.  
May their sacrifice and suffering be a lesson that we take into each event we plan and produce. worms aot mond

Understanding risk  
# management  
Awareness ts the first step  
What could be risky about an event? Events are fun! They’re all about gathering  
together to interact, celebrate, be entertained, and to learn new things. They are  
something to do, somewhere to go, something to look forward to. They happen  
everyday all over the world.  
This is the typical attitude I encounter all the time from students, friends, and peo-  
ple I meet when they ask about my work. They go to meetings and events all the  
time and they don’t see anything that could go wrong. But when I explain what  
could go wrong, the most common response is an awestruck ‘I had no idea!’ I then  
feel compelled to apologize because they will never again be able to attend a meet-  
ing or event without looking around at all the possible hazards.  
Risk management is one of the primary responsibilities of event organizers, yet so  
often ignored or misunderstood, particularly by inexperienced planners, because,  
like my now-paranoid event-goers, one can’t envision what one has not been exposed  
to — they don’t know what they don’t know. The two chapters in this section will  
show you how and why risk management is a fundamental component of meeting  
and event management, and introduce you to the functions of risk management  
within the overall field of events management and the tools you may use to perform  
these functions effectively. i211 qnibaanate rik

# Introduction  
Risk management is increasingly identified as a priority in today’s world. It is also  
coming to the forefront of the meetings and events industry, recognized in varying  
degrees as a key component of the responsibilities associated with the planning and  
producing of events. Some events celebrate the very pursuit of risk, seeking the  
excitement of potentially dangerous or lucrative outcomes, whilst others may oper-  
ate without an appreciation or even an understanding of the liabilities associated  
with their endeavors.  
Risk management is often perceived as a function that is carried out once an event  
has been conceived, designed, and organized. Risk management, however, should be  
thoroughly embedded in the event design and throughout its development and pro-  
duction process to ensure the risks associated with the event are managed effectively  
and cost efficiently.  
In reality, the risk manager is often brought into the event management process  
after a great many decisions have been made, and his or her job then becomes find-  
ing ways to mitigate the potential negative outcomes that might arise with the event  
as designed. The more the risk manager knows about the event management  
process and the events to be managed, the more likely he or she will be included a  
4 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
early in the process and be more influential in creating an event that delivers on  
expectations yet minimizes unfavorable consequences.  
Armed with a thorough understanding of the risks surrounding meetings and  
events of all types, the risk manager will be able to provide compelling reasons and  
creative solutions for each event and its specific risks.  
Risk, management, and risk  
# management  
Risk is the unknown, and the positive or negative outcomes that may be associated  
with the unknown. It is possibility — the possibility that something good or something  
bad might happen, the exposure to the possibility of loss, damage, or injury arising  
from an uncertainty. Risk is any condition or occurrence that might affect the outcome  
of an event or event activity and might expose an event organization to loss measured  
in terms of probability and consequences. Not all risk is bad. An event itself is a spec-  
ulative risk; its production incurs liabilities yet has the potential for economic, politi-  
cal, and/or social rewards. One needs to look at the worst that can happen and the best  
that can happen in order to be prepared for anything in between.  
¢ Speculative risk\: The possibility of loss and the possibility of gain.  
¢ Absolute risk\: The possibility of loss and NO possibility of gain.  
Management is the planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of resources  
and activities to achieve goals and objectives. Risk management is the purposeful  
recognition of and reaction to uncertainties with the explicit objective to minimize lia-  
bilities and maximize opportunities using a structured approach and common sense,  
rather than avoiding the issue \(see Figure 1.1\). The risk manager looks at all the vul-  
nerabilities, including financial and professional vulnerabilities and the threats to  
property and life and limb \(see Table 1.1\), and makes and carries out decisions that  
lessen the effects of potential losses.  
The goals of risk management include the protection of assets, to minimize legal  
and financial liabilities, to control potential loss, properly manage growth, and to  
operate responsibly \(Berlonghi, 1990\). The focus areas of risk management include  
legal and ethical responsibilities, health and safety, loss prevention, emergency pre-  
paredness, and good decision making. The tactics of risk management include expo-  
sure avoidance, loss prevention, loss reduction, contractual transfer, and exposure  
retention \(NFPA 1250, 2000\). The role of risk management is to prevent and reduce  
loss by ‘making events as safe and secure as possible’ \(Berlonghi, 1990, p. 4\).  
Much of the literature on risk management is presented in the context of insurance  
coverage and legal liability — loss prevention and loss control. While this is an impor-  
tant perspective, particularly to the success and sustainability of events and their  
hosts and hosting organizations, it is equally important, if not more so, to put this  
practice in the context of the health and safety of those who come together to create,  
operate, participate in, and attend these public and private assemblies. It is not  
unusual to approach the subject from the ‘loss’ perspective because when people are  
injured or killed and property is lost, damaged, or destroyed, the result is usually the The role of risk management for meetings and events 5

The risk factors listed in Table 1.2 represent many of the risks associated with events.  
This list is by no means comprehensive. It does not illustrate all the risks that may  
occur at events, and not all of these risk factors will be pertinent to all events. In  
addition, the relative severity of the risks will be different in different contexts and EEE

different event genre. What should be apparent from this list is that inexperience,  
lack of expertise, and insufficient planning and resources has a significant impact on  
the level of risk associated with an event. This expands exponentially as the size and  
scope of the event increases.  
| Consider this... 1.1  
Rave location via text messaging  
Underground organizers / promoters of raves, all-night dance parties, are now using text mes-  
saging features to inform cohorts of the secret location of the party venue in an attempt to avoid  
the scrutiny and control of authorities. These high energy events, a worldwide phenomenon  
that originated in the U.K. and Europe in the 1980s, are often held in abandoned warehouses,  
empty buildings, or at outdoor locations and typically include techno music and light shows,  
as well as lots of alcohol and drugs, and can attract anywhere from a few hundred to ten thou-  
sand or more teens and young adults. Secrecy is required to avoid enforcement of fire codes,  
health and safety ordinances, liquor laws, and licensing requirements for large public gather-  
ings. Ignoring the high numbers of alcohol and drug overdose cases requiring emergency room  
treatment resulting from these events, rave-goers justify this secrecy with complaints about the  
intrusion of government into their ‘freedom of association rights’ and the costs of attending  
commercial dance events, citing their goal of ‘only wanting to have a good time.’  
The role and scope of events  
An event is the gathering of people at a specified time and place for the purpose of  
celebration, commemoration, communication, education, reunion, and/or leisure.  
People attend events because of the opportunity for an entertainment, educational,  
cultural or enrichment experience, or to satisfy social, business, or political obligations.  
The term ‘event’ refers to any public or private planned event and includes a broad  
range of event genres \(see Table 1.3\). The context of an event is the core to effective risk  
management \(Frame, 2003\). The purpose of the event will dictate the decisions about  
what will be included in the event and the definition of success for the event.  
The characteristics of the event genres  
There are considerable similarities in the way events of all types are organized and  
managed. However, there are significant differences in each type of event that will  
influence the scope and types of risks to be managed. It is important to understand  
the context of the event and its typical characteristics because they all have different  
objectives and audiences, may be different in scope and purpose, and have different  
characteristics and requirements that the risk manager must focus on. Each of the  
event genres below includes events that may be scheduled alone or in conjunction  
with other events, and there may be different names for each type of event depend-  
ing on the corporate, geographic, or ethnographic culture. LS

¢ Festivals e Sports events  
Business and corporate events are any event created or produced by or for a corpo-  
ration that supports business objectives, including management functions, training,  
marketing, employee relations, and customer relations. These might include manage-  
ment meetings and conferences, product launch events, media conferences, company  
picnics or awards banquets, training programs or team building events, incentive  
travel programs, ground breakings or grand openings, open houses, and customer  
hospitality events. Corporate events typically have specific strategic objectives related  
to improving employee and financial performance through education, relationship  
building, and corporate communications. They often pose risks dealing with people,  
property, or proprietary information that must be protected.  
Cause-related and fund raising events are created by or for a charitable or cause-  
related group for the purpose of attracting revenue, support, and/or awareness. These  
events are often long-standing traditions for their target constituencies, but may be  
one-time or unique events created to capture a new audience or re-energize an exist-  
ing target market. They can encompass a broad range of events such as gala dinner  
dances, receptions, cook-offs, casino nights, auctions, tournaments, specialty tours,  
fun runs, walk-a-thons, and other ‘a-thons’. These events are often subject to strict  
financial reporting regulations and restrictions, particularly for fund raising activities.  
As they are often organized and staffed by volunteers, risk awareness can be a signif-  
icant problem as well.  
Exhibitions, expositions, and fairs are events for bringing buyers and sellers  
together to view and/or sell products, services and other resources to a specific indus-  
try, market, or the general public. These events include trade shows for horizontal or  
vertical industries such as product or destination showcases, and consumer or gate  
shows such as sporting goods, boat, gift, hobby, or car shows, and wellness or health  
fairs, and arts and crafts fairs. These also include mall shows, recruitment fairs, pet  
shows, flea markets, and agricultural fairs. Some of these public events can be consid-  
ered festivals because of their scope and annual frequency, and may attract oppor-  
tunistic criminals such as pickpockets that frequent high pedestrian traffic events.  
Restricted-entry trade shows may be subject to industrial espionage activities. All  
exhibits are vulnerable to theft of the products on display and the display equipment.  
Entertainment and leisure events are one-time or periodic, free or ticketed per-  
formances or exhibition events created for entertainment purposes. These include  
concerts, pageants, awards ceremonies, sightseeing or special interest tours, work-  
shops or lectures, re-enactments, and parades. These will attract different audiences  
depending on the target market demographics, for example, a hard rock concert for  
young adults versus a concert by a symphony orchestra, which will affect the nature  
of crowd management strategies required. Sometimes these events are considered  
attractions in themselves or may be produced by attractions such as theme parks, bio-  
logical or zoological parks, shopping complexes, schools, theaters, and museums. The role of risk management for meetings and events 9  
Festivals are cultural celebrations, either secular or religious, created by and for the  
public. Many festivals include bringing buyer and seller together in a festive atmos-  
phere. They can include seasonal or holiday festivals, music and dance festivals, eth-  
nic or heritage festivals, food festivals, carnivals, centennials, and local or regional  
fairs. Festivals often evolve around a sporting or cultural event as additional activities  
occur or are put in place due to a large attendance, particularly in conjunction with  
tourism initiatives. This large attendance attracts opportunistic crime, particularly as  
attendees are focusing on the celebration, not their surroundings. These events are  
often vulnerable to financial instability and non-professional management.  
Government and civic events are those comprised of or created by or for political  
parties or municipal or national government entities. These can include political  
rallies and campaign events, debates, summits, government meetings, community  
festivals, and official occasions such as inaugurations, investitures, state funerals,  
dedications, and receptions. Often involving dignitaries and sometimes controversy,  
these events require careful attention to protocol functions, constituency management,  
and the potential for confrontation.  
Marketing events are similar to and include business or corporate events but are  
specifically commerce-oriented events to facilitate bringing buyer and seller together  
or to create awareness of a commercial product or service. These include exhibits or  
product demonstrations held in a retail outlet, familiarization and facility tours, busi-  
ness exchanges, publicity stunts, fashion shows, trade show exhibits and showcases,  
and hospitality tents, suites, receptions, or theme parties. The emphasis in these events  
is on interaction and current and future sales, and often represents significant invest-  
ment and valuable property to be protected. The emphasis on getting consumer atten-  
tion can sometimes lead to potentially dangerous activities or tactics.  
Meetings and conventions are the assembly of people for the purpose of exchanging  
information, debate or discussion, consensus or decisions, education, and relationship  
building. These events are called by different names such as congresses, conferences,  
symposiums, colloquiums, assemblies, conclaves, study groups, or workshops. They  
are most often organized by and for trade or professional associations, corporate or  
government organizations, or social, military, educational, religious, and fraternal  
groups, and typically include numerous ancillary events such as receptions, banquets,  
trade shows, hospitality suites, companion programs, and sport tournaments. Such  
events may include a few hundred or several thousand attendees from local, regional,  
national, or international and multinational locations, and often have expansive and  
complex agendas. The most prevalent concerns for these events are proper contracting  
with hotels and other suppliers to achieve an acceptable balance of protection and risk  
for both the hosting organization and the service providers.  
Social and life-cycle events are private events, by invitation only, celebrating or com-  
memorating a cultural, religious, societal or life-cycle occasion. These include christen-  
ings and naming ceremonies, birthday parties and quinceaneras, bar/ bat mitzvahs and  
confirmations, graduations, debutante balls, weddings and commitment rituals,  
anniversaries, funerals, social or religious gatherings organized by clubs or places of  
worship, and family, school, or military reunions. Aside from the hazards associated  
with familial and societal politics, the most common set of risks are related to the  
inexperience of the organizer, often unaware of the scope of responsibilities associated  
with event management and/or under pressure from a client with unrealistic demands.  
Sports events are spectator or participatory events involving recreational or com-  
petitive sport activities. The sports event can be part of another event or a stand-alone  
event, and can include professional, amateur, or animal competitions, championships, ene  
10 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
matches, meets, games, tournaments, marathons, races, rallies, regattas, air shows,  
sports clinics, school sports, and team building events. These events often inherently  
celebrate risks associated with physical competition. Particular attention must be paid  
to audience size and potential rivalries for spectator sports events and participant abil-  
ities in participatory sports activities.  
The scope of the meetings and events industry  
The scope of the entire events industry is difficult to quantify definitively because  
there is no single source or organization collecting this data. In addition, the events  
industry is both horizontal \(numerous event genres\) and vertical \(each genre using  
a variety of goods and services\), which makes calculating total event spends very  
difficult. However, viewing the statistics provided in studies conducted by a variety  
of organizations offers a glimpse into the magnitude of the industry as a whole.  
The worldwide travel and tourism industry generates in excess of \$6.2 trillion \(U.S.  
dollars\) in economic activity including consumption, investment, government spend-  
ing and exports, of which personal travel and tourism accounts for more than \$2.8  
trillion and business travel, including the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhi-  
bitions \(MICE\) sector, accounts for \$652 billion \(WTTC, 2005\). The MICE industry in  
the U.S. represents more than \$122 billion in direct spending, directly supports more  
than 1.7 million jobs, and is the 29th largest contributor of private-sector industries to  
the country’s gross national product \(CIC, 2005\). In 2005 the United Nations recog-  
nized meeting and exhibition organizers within its International Standard Industrial  
Classification of All Economic Activities, adding gravitas to this industry’s contribu-  
tion to local and national economies worldwide \(ICCA, 2005\).  
More than 24 percent of domestic and 77 percent of domestic business travel  
expenditures are credited to meetings, with an event spend of approximately 55 per-  
cent on conventions and exhibitions and 45 percent on corporate and non-convention  
association meetings and incentives \(Krantz, 2005\). Direct spending per event by  
individual delegate is estimated at \$989, \$6753 per exhibiting company, and \$454 673  
by the event organizer \(IACVB, 2005\).  
There is more to consider than just the MICE sector when viewing these figures.  
Additional studies may be applicable to the 2.8 trillion dollar personal travel and  
tourism figures. Studies conducted by the Travel Industry Association of America  
indicate that 75 percent of the U.S. adult travelers attend cultural activities or events  
and 41 percent attended a festival and/or fair during their travel, 34 percent have  
traveled to attend family reunions, and 38 percent attended or participated in a  
sports event while traveling \(TIA, 2005\). The Association for Wedding Professionals  
International estimates that there are between 2.2 and 2.4 million weddings each  
year in the U.S. with a total event spend of approximately \$85 billion, an approxi-  
mate event spend of \$60 billion each year in Japan, more than nine million weddings  
in China per year with an average spend of \$19 900 per wedding, and the number of  
weddings throughout the world estimated at 115000 per day \(AFWPI, 2006\). The  
International Festivals and Events Association estimates about one million regularly  
re-occurring events \(large enough to require municipal support services\) take place  
around the world annually and their member events alone have combined atten-  
dances of 405 million people \(IFEA, 2005\).  
Festivals and sports events figure prominently in the sponsorship component of  
event marketing with sports receiving 69 percent and festivals, fairs, and annual  
events garnering 7 percent of the North American portion of worldwide sponsorship ST \] \] 9522 a EE ES  
The role of risk management for meetings and events 11  
spending in excess of \$28 billion \(IEG, 2005\). Promotional spending on event mar-  
keting, more than \$166 billion in 2004, represents 53 percent of promotions budgets  
and 25 percent of total marketing spend \(Joyce, 2005\) and more than 65 percent of in-  
house corporate event or meeting organizer respondents rate the value of special  
events to the overall marketing plan as very important or critical \(Event Solutions,  
2005\). Estimates indicated at least \$150 million in event spend for the large scale par-  
ties surrounding the 2006 Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles alone, a figure that might  
be doubled when including the entertaining and event marketing activities such as  
social, corporate, and nonprofit events \(Dubin, 2006\).  
It is unfortunate that the entire events industry has yet to come together, recognize  
its commonality and combined economic influence, and conduct the research neces-  
sary to quantify the actual number of events and their true event spends. Nevertheless,  
it is apparent that, as the IFEA suggests, events ‘touch virtually every life on the planet’  
\(IFEA, 2005\). Besides the economic value, events have social and cultural value through  
the development and enhancement of business and personal relationships, facilitating  
fraternal and familial reunion, and increasing community pride and improving quality  
of life through event tourism.  
The role and scope of event  
# management  
The role of event management is to facilitate the putting on of the event as well as the  
fulfillment of the needs and expectations of the customers or guests attending the  
event and the goals and objectives of its host or client. Why does the risk manager  
need to understand what event management is and how the event organizer per-  
forms his or her duties? In many cases the event organizer is the risk manager, and  
in those cases where the risk manager is a separate position, there must be a com-  
plete synergy between the two positions. In both cases a risk-aware attitude needs to  
be infused throughout the planning and production of the event.  
The event’s scope is determined through the needs assessment, specifying the why  
\(the purpose and role of the event\); the who \(the audience and stakeholders\); the  
when \(day, date, and duration\); the where \(location and available space\); and the what  
\(the resources available and desired outcomes\). The event organizer must determine  
and examine the many factors that will shape the design and production of an event,  
even the simplest of events. It may be advantageous to think of the scope of an event  
as three tents \(Silvers, 2004a\)\:  
1 Intent\: The purpose of the event; why it is being held; what the host or hosting  
organization wants to accomplish by holding the event \(the goals and objectives\).  
2 Extent\: The size of the event; the space required; the duration; the number of  
guests; the volumes of materials, equipment, supplies, and suppliers.  
3 Content\: The event elements and components desired or required to meet the goals  
and objectives of the event.  
Research into the event management body of knowledge \(EMBOK\) suggests the  
scope of event management consists of phases, processes, core values, and functional oT  
12 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
areas \(Silvers, 2004b, 2005; Silvers, Bowdin, O'Toole, and Nelson, 2006\). The EMBOK  
Model \(www.embok.org\) proposes a knowledge framework and descriptive sum-  
mary of the scope and processes that are used in the management of events. The  
sequential aspect of the phases and iterative nature of the processes, which are per-  
meated with core values, allows one to approach the functional areas in a compre-  
hensive and systematic manner. But, of prime importance is the illustration of the  
full scope of the responsibilities, and therefore the risk management obligations,  
assigned to event organizers.  
The process of event management  
It is useful to begin with the process system for event management \(see Figure 1.2\),  
which includes assessment, selection, monitoring, communication, and documenta-  
tion, because this process system \(and the proposed terminology\) is based on widely  
accepted process models for risk management. It is a sequential and iterative system  
that promotes a dynamic approach to the changing nature of events \(and the risks  
that emerge\).  
e Assessment is a two-step process of first identification then analysis. Identification  
is a discovery and definition process in which all the elements in each category are  
considered. The analytical process enhances predictive capabilities and facilitates  
proper prioritizing by qualifying and quantifying the characteristics of an element.  
¢ Selection is the decision-making point, choosing the methods or tactics deemed  
most likely to achieve the goal or objective. Coupled with this decision are the  
assignment of resources, responsibility, and authority to carry out the tactic  
selected.  
¢ Monitoring includes the regimented and planned tracking of the progress, status or  
conditions of the tactic selected, including the performance of risk control actions,  
and developing further options and actions as needed by reiterating the assess-  
ment and selection processes.

Documentation includes the recording, reporting, maintaining and archiving of  
assessments, analyses, response plans, monitoring and control results, and other  
records and documents, and provides valuable data and important evidence that  
leads to a robust management process.  
¢ Communication is a vital component of the process system, which includes timely  
information acquisition and distribution plus the appropriate consultation in  
decision making. It is important to involve the appropriate constituents to achieve  
a comprehensive assessment and to foster acceptance of and support for the deci-  
sions made.  
The phases of event management  
The phases of event management illustrate its sequential nature, highlighting the crit-  
icality of time in any event project as it gathers momentum toward the event itself \(see  
Figure 1.3\). The progression is also cyclical, with the results of the evaluation phase  
contributing to the research phase of the next event. The phases include initiation,  
planning, implementation, the event, and closure, and are derived from traditional  
project management terminology \(PMI, 2000\). Effective event management \(and risk  
management\) relies on engagement at each juncture of this continuum throughout the  
life of the event project, from inception through completion.  
e Initiation is the phase in which research is conducted and the concept is defined  
and validated. This is when the scope and context is set, goals and objectives are  
defined and the commitment of resources is established. This is also when a com-  
mitment to risk management must be instituted.  
¢ Planning is the phase wherein the requirements and specifications for the event proj-  
ect are determined, specifying the activities that will occur, how efforts will be  
organized, the resources that will be required, and the context, conditions, or  
assumptions that affect the decisions to be made. Risk planning provides the struc-  
ture for making decisions based on realistic assumptions and accepted methods.  
¢ Implementation is the phase when all the goods and services are contracted and  
coordinated, synchronizing all the operational and logistical requirements of an  
Go/no-go decisions

event project. Risk management techniques are required during this phase to  
ensure the proper verification and control activities are employed.  
© The Event phase is set apart from Implementation as a distinct phase because a differ-  
ent and dynamic approach is required once the production begins. Although the  
above phases have the possibility of go/no-go decisions, once the event begins the  
only no-go possibility for the event is closure \(or specific elements or activities  
included in the event\). Risk monitoring and control functions are critical during this  
phase so that hazards or incidents are responded to ina timely and effective manner.  
© Closure is the decommissioning phase in which the event production is shut down,  
dismantled, and contractual obligations are completed. This phase also includes the  
collection of feedback and the review of actions, activities, and decisions. This infor-  
mation is then evaluated to determine measurements \(e.g., return on investment\) or  
ratings against established criteria \(e.g., performance critiques\), reveal impacts \(e.g.,  
economic, environmental, social, and cultural\), and to record lessons learned that  
will facilitate the effective transfer of knowledge to the next event project.  
The core values of event management  
The core values are those principles that must be applied to all decisions regarding  
every event element, phase, and process to ensure these decisions facilitate success-  
ful and sustainable outcomes. It is equally important to infuse all risk management  
decisions with these same fundamental values.  
\* Continuous improvement is a quality management philosophy that contends an  
optimized performing organization depends on the continuous and proactive  
improvement of all procedures, systems and, it is thereby presumed, the results  
rather than relying on reaction-driven planning.  
\* Creativity is regarded as essential for producing innovative and imaginative solu-  
tions and approaches to the challenges and opportunities presented throughout the  
management of an event project. Employing the qualities of inventiveness, inspira-  
tion, artistry, and resourcefulness are particularly important in the event industry.  
¢ Ethics encompass the judgments and choices made and the actions taken that reflect  
and enact beliefs of what is right versus wrong. Embedded in most codes of con-  
duct for the event and other industries, these standards guide the decisions, nego-  
tiations, and activities in a way that maintains integrity, fairness and decency.  
¢ Integration reflects the critical need to coordinate, synchronize and merge the vari-  
ety and multitude of interactions, dependencies and interconnected elements  
included in an event project to ensure decisions incorporate all the factors influ-  
encing and influenced by those choices.  
¢ Strategic thinking is the ability to view and align an individual project’s needs and  
methods within the entirety of an enterprise’s short- and long-term goals and  
objectives in order to maintain a focus on the larger issues and impacts that should  
be factored into plans and tactics.  
The functional areas of event management  
The 35 functional areas of event management of the EMBOK Model are organized  
into five domains, with each domain representing an overarching area of activity,  
which may reflect an organizational structure or a modularized category for study  
and/or analysis. Within each functional area are found numerous aspects or elements DIETS =\~ LLL LLL LE eA TATA ETT A Stee asm eananeeenaemaaneseesimmmeee  
The role of risk management for meetings and events 15  
\(e.g., human resources\: volunteers\) that have specific characteristics and are affected  
by and subject to different objectives, procedures, constraints, and standards during  
the different phases and processes.  
The administration domain deals primarily with the proper allocation, direction,  
and control of the resources used in an event project. Since resources are finite by  
definition, it is imperative that they be acquired, developed, and utilized in the most  
efficient and effective manner to benefit the event project and limit its risk.  
¢ Financial management\: budgets, costing and pricing, asset and cash flow management,  
accounting.  
¢ Human resources management\: organizational structure and culture, workforce  
recruitment-retention cycle, employees, volunteers, and contracted staffing.  
¢ Information management\: information acquisition, distribution, and control.  
¢ Procurement management\: specifications, source selection, contract administration,  
and change controls.  
¢ Stakeholder management\: client and constituency relations, strategic alliances, and  
power/urgency control.  
¢ Systems management\: physical and conceptual systems, knowledge transfer, and  
technology usage.  
¢ Time management\: activity architecture, schedule development, and schedule control.  
The design domain focuses on the artistic interpretation and expression of the goals  
and objectives of the event project and its experiential dimensions. The elements devel-  
oped within each functional area combine to create the event experience encounter that  
will either be enjoyed or endured, with some options considered ‘risky’ by their very  
nature or by design.  
\* Content design\: topic and format selection, speaker selection, education obliga-  
tions, and adult learning principles.  
¢ Entertainment design\: sourcing and selecting entertainment, entertainer require-  
ment fulfillment, and performance and performer controls.  
¢ Environment design\: décor and furnishings, layout, functional placement, and  
wayfinding.  
¢ Food and beverage design\: menu selection, service styles, alcohol management, and  
catering operations.  
¢ Production design\: sound, lighting, visual and multimedia presentations, and spe-  
cial effects.  
° Program design\: activity agenda development, experience choreography, ceremo-  
nial and hospitality requirements.  
° Theme design\: theme development, cultural iconography, imagery, and branding.  
The marketing domain addresses the functions that facilitate business development,  
cultivate economic and political support, and shape the image and value of the  
event project. The nature of the event as an ‘experience’ necessitates a thorough  
understanding of the unique buyer-seller relationship associated with this intangi-  
ble product.

¢ Sponsorship management\: sponsorship and donors, benefits packaging, solicitation,  
and servicing sponsors.  
The operations domain concentrates on the people, products, and services that will  
be brought together on-site to produce the event project, as well as the roles, respon-  
sibilities, applications, and maneuvers associated with each. Impeccable coordina-  
tion is required in order to manage this symphony \(or cacophony\) of logistical and  
functional requirements and expectations.  
e Attendee management\: registration, ticketing, and housing systems, admittance con-  
trols, movement and traffic flow, and crowd management.

¢ Participant management\: speaker and performer relations, celebrity and dignitary  
management, and athletic competitors and officials management.  
¢ Site management\: sourcing, inspection, selection, arrangement, and development.  
¢ Technical management\: staging and equipment, installation, operation, and techni-  
cian support.  
The risk domain deals with the protective obligations, opportunities, and legalities  
traditionally associated with any enterprise, including an event project. These areas are  
inextricably linked with every choice made and all activities conducted, and are  
increasingly mandated by stakeholders ranging from regulatory authorities to discrim-  
inating event consumers.  
° Compliance management\: statutes, codes, and regulations, accessibility, intellectual  
property rights, and compliance instrument acquisition.  
¢ Decision management\: decision framing and criteria, deliberation, collaboration,  
authority, and empowerment.  
Emergency management\: medical services, evacuations, crisis management, and dis-  
aster recovery.  
° Health and safety management\: fire and life safety, occupational safety, health and  
welfare, and crowd behavior and control.  
E nsurance management\: loss prevention, liability, coverage requirements, and policy  
acquisition and management.  
¢ Legal management\: negotiation, contracts, licenses and authority, policies and pro-  
cedures, and ethics.

The role of risk management for meetings and events 17  
The scope of event management may initially appear overwhelming, however, these  
are all things most event management practitioners address everyday in their pro-  
fessional lives; they just may not have been itemized as discrete functions, just as we  
no longer itemize each task or skill required to drive our car. We just ‘do it.’ And if  
one were to really think about driving that car, there are hundreds of implications  
and applications that must be considered and thousands of calculations and deci-  
sions that must be made every time one starts out and for every route one takes.  
Although much of this decision making becomes automatic, in order to imple-  
ment the proper integration and facilitate the desired continuous improvement, the  
use of tools and job performance aids based on this comprehensive approach  
reduces the likelihood of overlooking or discounting factors \(not to mention the  
ubiquitous ‘Oh, I forgot’\) that may have a significant impact on the ability to man-  
age risks associated with an event project. The chart shown in Figure 1.4 illustrates  
how the EMBOK Model might be used when planning an event project.  
The integration of risk  
management and event  
# management  
Just as with the event management process, the risk management process is a  
sequential and cyclical one, as well as an iterative one. Each and every aspect of an  
event has an impact on the whole event. Each and every decision made about an  
event could affect how the resources will be allocated. Each and every event has var-  
ious positive features to take advantage of and obstacles to overcome.  
Using the process-phase-core values chart, the risk manager could scrutinize each  
box for potential risk factors or vulnerabilities. Using the domain-class-element model  
of the 35 functional areas provides a framework that compels event organizers to con-  
sider the full scope of an event project when conducting a risk assessment or a feasi-  
bility analysis. For example, the chart shown in Figure 1.5 illustrates some of the  
questions that might be asked about volunteer usage during the planning phase. It  
must be remembered that this chart only presents one question for each functional  
area during one phase \(there are likely many more\) for only one element. If one exam-  
ines the true scope of decisions and considerations that may be applicable to a partic-  
ular event project, probing each of these discrete functions and their elements is  
necessary when seeking to manage the risks surrounding the event.  
The role of the risk manager  
The event’s risk manager must work with the event organizer to ensure that risk  
management is infused throughout the planning and execution of the event project  
and that the event organization is risk resilient - knowing the risks and being  
prepared to compensate for and finance them. There must be clarity for both the  
event organizer and risk manager \(if these roles are not performed by the same indi-  
vidual\) on the scope and specifications of the event \(see Appendix A\: Event concept  
worksheet\). 18 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

etc.\), municipal and facility authorities, sponsors, and providers.  
¢ Structure of authority, including who has the lead role as risk manager.  
¢ When to walk away!  
Goals and objectives must be specified and prioritized so that the decisions will  
maintain the integrity of the event purpose when alternatives are examined to pro-  
vide a less risky option. The commitment to risk management must be made — in  
word and deed. This includes formally designating a risk manager and decriminal-  
izing risk so that anyone who identifies a risk is not penalized for doing so \(Defense  
Acquisition University, 2002\). Sufficient resources must be allocated and risk man-  
agement policies should be instituted that reflect this commitment. For example, a  
meetings policy that addresses risk assessment and management procedures, ethics,  
signature authority, etc., might be developed by a corporation or association to illus-  
trate accepted practices and delineate decision-making guidelines.  
The event’s hosting organization must be made to understand the risks surround-  
ing the event and its activities in order to make viable, effective, and acceptable deci-  
sions regarding the choices to be made. Some hosts, producers, or sponsoring  
organizations have different tolerance levels for risk, and for different categories of  
risk. Some are particularly averse to financial risks; others may be more averse to  
potentially damaging publicity; and some may be completely oblivious to any of the  
risks and, therefore, unable to even define its tolerance level.  
It will likely be up to the risk manager to facilitate this understanding by illustrating  
the benefits of planning for and dealing with risks, and, if necessary, the disadvantages  
of not doing so. Scare tactics will not be as effective as the rational examination of the  
opportunities that proper risk management will offer. Just as there are hundreds of  
choices to be made about what the event will include and how it will be accomplished,  
there are countless ways to achieve those goals and objectives in a manner that pro-  
tects the safety and well-being of the event audience and the event organization.  
# Summary  
Risk isn’t the same thing as ‘risky.’ Risk is merely an uncertainty, an unknown out-  
come. Risks can have favorable and unfavorable outcomes. Risk management is the  
way in which these uncertainties are properly identified, judiciously considered,  
and addressed so that they will have the best chance of a beneficial outcome and the  
least chance of a detrimental one.  
The process of risk management is parallel to that of event management, which  
encompasses sequential and iterative systems that examine the extensive range of  
administrative and operational facets of the design and marketing of an event, no  
matter what type of event is being produced. Risk management is an integrated and  
integral part of the event management process for any event — any type, size, pur-  
pose, or style. Any and all events bring people together at a particular time, in a par-  
ticular place, for a particular purpose. And, no matter what type of event is being  
produced, the systems and processes remain essentially the same.  
The EMBOK Model explicitly captures, categorizes, and defines the processes,  
phases, core values, and functions in a framework that not only illustrates the  
complexity of this profession and facilitates effective competency and conformity The role of risk management for meetings and events 21  
assessments, portable knowledge transfer systems, and efficient practical applica-  
tions; it serves as the strategic framework for consistent and comprehensive risk  
management for events.  
There is no such thing as a ‘risk free’ event. Although the risk factors may vary  
from event to event, every event and every event organization is subject to risk that  
must be managed in order to achieve the objectives of the event and the goals of risk  
management — to protect assets, minimize liabilities, control potential loss, manage  
growth, and operate responsibly.  
Key strategies  
° Recognize that the meetings and events industry is a significant part of the world-  
wide economy offering a broad variety of opportunities — for rewards and for  
risks.  
Acknowledge that risk is inherent in all events but its potential rewards are often  
the reason the event is being held.  
° Specialization in certain types of events often provides a depth of understanding  
that increases the ability to manage their particular risks.  
e Approach risk management in a comprehensive, systematic, and iterative manner  
to ensure full attention is given to the scope of your responsibilities.  
e Limit risk by first ensuring sufficient planning, expertise, and resources are in  
place.  
¢ Infuse risk management awareness and tactics throughout the event project from  
inception to execution to evaluation.

# Introduction  
Effective risk management requires a thorough and thoughtful procedure that  
examines and analyzes each possibility, then takes the necessary steps and allocates  
the proper resources to control the risks. It is an integrated, iterative, and on-going  
process throughout the life of an event, beginning at the very inception of the event  
and ending with the evaluation of the event, which provides valuable information  
and strategies to be applied to the next event.  
All risks are not equal. All risks are not readily apparent. The range of possible out-  
comes, plus the implications and factors that contribute to those possible outcomes,  
must be considered so that plans may be made to ensure readiness to address the con-  
sequences should the situation or outcome occur. The event risk manager must work  
with the event stakeholders to determine the foreseeable risks and the levels of tolera-  
ble risk, then establish a formal record of the agreed upon roles, responsibilities, sys-  
tems, and arrangements necessary to manage the identified risks. The risk management process, tools, and techniques 25

Figure 2.1 The risk management process  
The risk management process  
Risk management for meetings and events is a defined and deliberate process; one  
that must be planned and consistently applied for it to be effective. This process is  
sequential in nature, yet it must be iterative in practice. It is not a one-time activity that  
may be completed and then the job is done. Risk management must be an on-going  
and dynamic activity because the risks surrounding meetings and events are con-  
stantly emerging, growing, subsiding, changing, and fluctuating in terms of urgency  
and priority. The risk management process must also be proactive and cyclical, facili-  
tating communication, forecasting, and forward planning. The risk management  
process illustrated in Figure 2.1 is based on widely accepted process models for risk  
management \(Broder, 2000; Defense Acquisition University, 2002; Frame, 2003;  
Kendrick, 2003; NFPA 1250, 2000; PMI, 2000\), in particular, the risk management stan-  
dard for Australia and New Zealand \(Standards Australia, 1999\).  
The event risk manager must plan for managing risk by determining the processes  
and procedures. The risks associated with the event must be assessed by identifying  
and analyzing them. Decisions about how to handle the risks must be made. The sta-  
tus of those risks must be monitored to ensure the risk-handling options are effective  
and the risks themselves are being controlled \(and repeating various parts of the  
process if they are not\). Documenting everything needs to be done in order to con-  
tribute to the risk management process for the next event. The scope of the risk man-  
agement process will depend on the size and type of event being produced, but its  
sequential and iterative nature remains the same.  
Risk planning  
Risk planning is the development and maintenance of a systematic and continu-  
ous approach for identifying, evaluating, handling, tracking, documenting, and EEE EEIEE EES

be established by specifying the activities that will occur, how efforts will be organ-  
ized, the resources that will be required, and the context, conditions, or assumptions  
that affect the decisions to be made.  
The purpose of the risk planning is to provide the structure for making decisions  
based on realistic assumptions and accepted methods, incorporating best practices  
and the lessons learned from previous endeavors to achieve maximum benefits \(see  
Table 2.1\). This requires a commitment from both the meeting or event organizer and  
the client or hosting organization to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated, that  
activities and decisions are acceptable according to the goals and objectives for the  
event, and that the approach is fully supported and suitable to that particular event.  
The outcome of risk planning is the risk management plan, which articulates the  
framework for proactively dealing with uncertainties and specifies the requirements,  
roles, and responsibilities for implementation. This requires conscious preparation  
and forethought — two activities that, by their very application, serve to reduce risk.

Is a formal plan such as this necessary for all events? Yes and no. For small events  
this is often an intellectual exercise rather than a formal document, but it is highly  
recommended, and sometimes mandated by law, that you prepare and document  
this formal plan. Doing so facilitates continuous improvement, and should some-  
thing go wrong, the written plan along with other written documentation could  
become extremely important to show due diligence was performed. And just as  
writing is easier if you have done the thinking, planning is easier if you have con-  
sidered the scope of responsibilities and possible tactics to achieve success, embed-  
ding the management of risk into the very design of the event.  
Risk assessment  
Risk assessment is the process of identifying and analyzing event elements and  
processes to increase the probability of success and reduce the impact of potential  
losses. This is a two-stage procedure that first identifies and then quantifies potential 28 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
risks. Risk assessment is a critical component of risk management, frequently relied  
upon as evidentiary proof of compliance with best practices, and often mandated by  
employment law or other legislation \(HSE, 1999; Ronan, 2004\). Without conducting  
a risk assessment you have, by default, summarily decided to accept the liabilities  
for all risks.  
The scope of the risk assessment includes the collection of all pertinent data through  
a variety of methods to identify as many potential hazards or vulnerabilities associ-  
ated with the event as possible. This may include reviewing historical records of the  
event and comparable events, conducting interviews with stakeholders and the  
appropriate authorities, and holding meetings with staff, suppliers, and stakeholders.  
This discovery process is followed by the examination and evaluation of identified  
risks to determine their characteristics, their likelihood of happening, the impact  
should they occur, and the possible responses based on the priorities and resources of  
the event. As there are never unlimited resources to allocate to risk management, the  
identified risks must be compared and ranked to establish which of the identified risks  
merit response and a priority for which must be handled first, second, and so forth.  
It is important to involve the appropriate stakeholder constituents in the risk  
assessment process to achieve a comprehensive assessment, to create awareness and  
foster acceptance and support for risk management objectives, and to illustrate duty  
of care. Duty of care is the legal requirement that everything ‘reasonably practical’  
has been done to protect safety and health.  
¢ Legal documentation\: The event organization should be able to provide documented  
evidence that a risk assessment has been conducted and that the appropriate  
stakeholder consultation took place.  
Insurance companies\: Many insurance companies now require risk assessments  
with stakeholder consultation as a condition for issuing coverage.  
Regulatory authorities\: The appropriate regulatory authorities must be consulted  
and informed of the risks and the response plans associated with the event.  
Staff and stakeholders\: The staff and stakeholders must be made aware so that they  
realize the risks, consequences, and responsibilities of participating in the event  
project.  
A stakeholder is any individual or organization that holds a functional or financial  
stake in the meeting or event \(see Table 2.2\), which will be discussed further in  
Chapter 8. Each stakeholder will bring a different sphere of experience, level of  
expertise, and point of view to the table. Each will have a different emphasis on what  
is important, as well as different suggestions for treatment options. Each will have  
different goals, objectives, motives, and requirements.  
Risk response  
Risk response encompasses evaluating, selecting, and implementing the techniques  
for handling risks, including what is to be done, when, and who will be responsible.  
In order to create effective risk response plans for an event, a systematic process  
must be employed that identifies the potential risks, analyzes their causes and  
effects, and evaluates the options suitable for responding to each identified risk. The  
response plans must specify the triggers that will instigate a response, the proce-  
dures to be followed, and the person or personnel responsible for implementing the  
response. ee ee ee

Consider this... 2.1  
Building demolition turned into an event by local authorities  
July 13, 1997\: The Royal Canberra Hospital was demolished via implosion to make way for the  
National Museum of Australia. The spectacular demolition was advertised as an event so that  
the public could watch. Implosions around the world typically achieve international interest  
and over 100000 people attended this event, making it one of Canberra’s largest crowds ever.  
Tragically the implosion produced large pieces of shrapnel that killed a 12-year-old girl and  
injured nine other spectators situated more than 500 meters away. Prior to the event the  
engineers and relevant authorities did a risk assessment of the implosion, but this risk assess-  
ment was from the point of view of traditional civil engineering. When the implosion became  
an event, the risks were very different. The fact that the safety had been addressed from the  
civil engineering point of view obscured the fact that safety was different for the public. The  
risks that needed to be identified were those that were a risk to the event and its spectators.  
The lesson here is that risks may not be recognized, even by experts, unless they are the right  
experts.

The four typical risk treatment options include avoidance, reduction, retention, and  
transference. Selecting the most appropriate option or combination of actions relies on  
an understanding of the treatment option, its likely impact on costs, schedules and  
performance, and the efficacy of its usage. It also relies on the understanding of the  
risk itself because what can be done to deal with controllable risk and mitigate the  
effects of uncontrollable risk depends a great deal on its cause and impact and your  
resources \(Kendrick, 2003\).  
The questions to ask when considering the risk response options\:  
e Will it still meet the needs of the event?  
e Will it be effective?  
e Is it affordable? Is it economical?  
¢ Is there enough time to develop and implement it?  
¢ What effect will it have on the event plan?  
e What effect will it have on the other identified risks?  
Not all risks merit response actions; some will be so insignificant or improbable that  
action is not necessary and many might be mitigated through simple adjustments or  
improved planning. A realistic balance of the resources required for implementing  
the response, its likely benefits, and the resources available must be achieved.  
Investing time, money, and other resources in risk treatment requires assurance that  
the investment is justified for the level of risk reduction or control achieved. In order  
to obtain approval, illustrate how difficult, costly, and time-consuming it would be  
to recover should the risk occur.  
All personnel, departments, and other stakeholders affected by the response  
option\(s\) selected must be advised of the response to be taken and its potential impact.  
This may uncover secondary risks, a risk that arises as a direct result of implementing  
a risk response, which must be addressed. Making the risk assessment and response  
planning visible to stakeholders often provides additional incentive to adopt the risk  
management strategies recommended, and prepares people for the response actions,  
enabling them to respond quickly, intelligently, and without panic or indecision.  
Once the risks have been identified, described, and analyzed, the risk manager  
creates a risk register that details all the identified risks, the results of the analyses  
used to evaluate them, the proposed responses to handle them, the processes and  
persons assigned to monitor and track them, and the effects on cost and the sched-  
ule \(see Appendix B\: Risk register worksheet\). It should provide the definitions of  
risks, the integrated priorities as a basis for decisions, and the descriptions of how  
risks will be treated. It should be used to integrate the individual risk response plans  
with each other and with the overall event plans.  
The response plan addresses\:  
¢ Who\: Who will be responsible for monitoring the risk and implementing the  
response.  
¢ What\: The definition of the risk, its priority, and what corrective action is to be taken.  
¢ Where\: Where that risk fits into the overall plans and its effects on other risks.  
e When\: When monitoring reports are due and when a corrective action will be  
indicated.  
e How\: The procedures for taking the action and the resources required if  
implemented.

Person responsible Individuals  
Figure 2.2 Response plan triggers, actions, and individuals  
As shown in Figure 2.2, the response plan must specify the triggers or thresholds  
that will cause the response to be implemented. There may be sequential triggers as  
secondary or residual risks emerge. It must specify the corrective or response actions  
to be taken at each trigger, including the procedures for taking those actions. The  
individual responsible for implementing the response must have the decision-making  
authority to do so.  
Risk monitoring and control  
Risk monitoring is the systematic tracking of the status of risks and the performance  
of risk control actions and developing further risk-handling options and actions as  
needed. This must be a preplanned, continuous, and iterative process that proac-  
tively collects and analyzes information so progress, status, and conditions may be  
observed and responded to with corrective tactics in a timely manner. As illustrated  
in Figure 2.3, risk monitoring is conducted throughout the life of the event project,  
from inception through completion.  
Risk monitoring might be viewed as preventative as well as predictive maintenance;  
seeking validation that the meeting or event and its risk management plans are on  
track and that variances can be addressed with the appropriate responses. Monitoring  
activities focus on the impacted areas if a risk occurs using a variety of targets, meas-  
urements, and thresholds, known as triggers.  
Triggers, indications that a risk has occurred or is about to occur, are typically deter-  
mined in the risk identification process. A trigger is activated when a specific thresh-  
old has been reached and will put a response plan into action. Thresholds are  
established by the levels of risk tolerance identified by the event specifications, stake-  
holders, and available resources, and are often expressed in boundaries, capacities,  
deadlines, policies, regulations, requirements, and restrictions \(see Figure 2.4\).  
Risk control responses must be based on the actual conditions or amount of vari-  
ance; one does not implement a thousand-dollar solution to a one-dollar problem. eee nn EN NE LL CE ET EE LL LL EL

This is where the iterative nature of the process and flexibility comes into play. It is  
the nature of risk that, as it represents uncertainty, it is unlikely to occur exactly as  
anticipated. The risk manager, or the individuals tasked with monitoring and  
responding to risks, must understand the nature of that risk and the extent of its Ss sions seca  
The risk management process, tools, and techniques 33  
influence on other risk areas in order to employ \(or improvise\) the proper type and  
level of response. This often requires reapplication of the risk analysis and response  
planning techniques, and always requires knowledge, experience, and common sense.  
The fallacy of ‘control’  
It is critical to understand the singular importance of conducting a thorough risk  
assessment in the context of ‘controlling’ risk. The plain fact is that one does not ‘con-  
trol’ what can or will happen at an event. It is often noted that event management, and  
consequently risk management, encompasses the initial and iterative planning and  
then it is all about change management. And there are ALWAYS changes or incidents  
occurring at an event ... things NEVER go exactly as planned ... and one can never  
eliminate ALL risks. You have NO CONTROL over changes happening, only your  
ability to react effectively to those changes. You must be proactive about the ability to  
be reactive.  
Effective change management \(proactive reactions\) relies on information, familiar-  
ity, good judgment, and being prepared, not paralyzed. One must know how to prop-  
erly identify problems, how to analyze problems, and how to solve problems. In the  
throes of an event the rapid cognition of our adaptive unconscious plays a significant  
role in our judgment and decision making, but the efficacy of these decisions is deter-  
mined by the depth and breadth of our experience and knowledge \(Gladwell, 2005\).  
Incorporate preventative measures to prevent what you can prevent, and then focus  
on preparedness. The more aware you are of what could go wrong, the better prepared  
you can be to react and respond properly and effectively to an incident or occurrence.  
For example, as illustrated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hitting the U.S. Gulf Coast  
in 2005, there was nothing one could do to stop the hurricanes from happening; one  
could only control the way in which one prepared for and reacted to the hurricane.  
Risk communication  
Risk communication involves both information transfer and consultation, requiring  
two-way capability for giving and getting messages about the entire scope of the  
event and its risk management activities, actions, and outcomes. Effective risk com-  
munication should facilitate this collaboration and the acquisition of proactive data  
that helps predict and prepare for risks, and getting risk messages before, not after,  
something has happened \(Smith and Merritt, 2002\). The decriminalization of risk  
should be ingrained throughout the event team \(we won't shoot the messenger\) so  
that everyone feels empowered and obligated to communicate risk messages.  
Communications procedures and methods should be embedded throughout the  
event project, from inception through evaluation, to ensure the right information gets  
to and is received from the right people at the right time. In addition to written com-  
munications such as performance or status reports, change orders, and other docu-  
mentation, meetings offer the unique opportunity for tapping into the collective  
intelligence of the event team.  
When the risk manager is included in meetings early in the planning stages, it is  
possible to establish the relationships with the key stakeholders that will foster accept-  
ance of risk management as an inherent and necessary initiative. It is helpful to pre-  
pare a stakeholder analysis that identifies each stakeholder’s role, expectations,  
concerns, and influence over the decisions about the event project. Meetings are excep-  
tionally valuable during the risk assessment phase, bringing together all those who  
will be involved in the event's implementation and allowing them to form into a team ee EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

and build on each other’s experience and expertise. This teamwork becomes even  
more important as the event project goes into production.  
A sound communications infrastructure is critical to the effectiveness of risk mon-  
itoring and control strategies, and must facilitate the proper flow of information  
\(Kendrick, 2003\) as illustrated in Figure 2.5. The information must be timely, accu-  
rate, and to the point, and once a corrective action has been taken, this must be com-  
municated to internal and external staff, suppliers, and stakeholders. Regularly  
scheduled meetings will support these objectives as progress, changes, and emerg-  
ing risks can be reviewed and addressed.  
Risk documentation  
Risk documentation includes the recording, reporting, maintaining, and archiving  
of assessments, analyses, response plans, monitoring and control results, and other  
records and documents. Creating such documentation should be formally man-  
dated as an administrative ‘deliverable’ of the event project — part of the tasks spec-  
ified in the event plans and work breakdown structure — and acknowledged by the  
event management as a due diligence responsibility. Establishing a formal docu-  
mentation procedure demonstrates that a systematic and appropriate risk manage-  
ment process was conducted and, due to its visibility as an obligatory function, often  
results in a more comprehensive risk assessment.  
Risk documentation should be conducted throughout the event project in order to  
capture important information that serves the current risk discovery, monitoring,  
and control activities, as well as archives such information for future use. When doc-  
umentation is generated it provides valuable data and important evidence that leads  
to a robust risk management process. It supports retrospective analyses, mecha-  
nisms for authorization and accountability, and the ‘paper trail’ necessary to vali-  
date actions and verify outcomes.  
Documentation adds to an event organization’s knowledge base, supplying rele-  
vant data that not only promotes the identification and understanding of what could  
go wrong \(risk management\); it also provides a method for identifying what could go  
better \(opportunity management\) in order to take full advantage of the possible  
results. Strategies and activities may be evaluated to determine which areas or  
actions are efficient or deficient and effective or ineffective, as well as which program EEE IEE EL LLL LT LE TS LTT TE ISL CLT OSLO SLE SLE DE ELLEN IELTS EAN\: CASSEL TE CCEA L LE I ETL LE NER CLI CACC ECLA ACS NON LELE Le IOIE  
The risk management process, tools, and techniques 35  
elements, policies, and procedures should be continued, revised, or deleted. Such  
background material is critical for new personnel or new event projects.  
The decision-making process can be reconstructed and decisions reviewed to  
determine and understand the underlying rationale, correct or incorrect, on which  
those decisions were based. This identification leads to improved awareness of cur-  
rent and future assumptions and constraints, as well as defining and validating for  
stakeholders why specific actions are \(or were\) required or recommended, provid-  
ing event management and risk management decision-makers with the strategy for  
acquiring approval and authority for implementation because an audit trail is  
clearly defined and supplied.  
The evidentiary nature of documentation is two-fold. First, it provides verification  
of the results and outcomes realized. This information supports the current moni-  
toring activities, retrospective and prospective analytical activities, plus audits and  
other assessments. Second, documentation provides official and/or legal evidence  
of occurrences, incidents, and the exercising of duty of care.  
The tools and techniques for  
effective risk management  
A variety of tools and techniques can be used throughout the risk management  
process to ensure an effective, comprehensive, and proactive approach. Determining  
which tool or technique to use at any given phase should be based on the type,  
scope, and magnitude of the meeting or event, as well as the experience, expertise,  
and engagement of the stakeholders involved. Each tool or technique offers a differ-  
ent practical method for accomplishing the task at hand, and using a combination  
provides the most effective results.  
Risk identification  
Risk identification is the examination of event elements and processes to define possi-  
ble risks, triggers, and thresholds using a variety of methods. Numerous techniques  
can facilitate this discovery process, but it all begins with the clearly identified pro-  
gram or project plan defining the goals and objectives for the event, the type and  
extent of activities included, the people involved, and the processes to be used. The  
outcome of the risk identification process should be a list describing potential risks to  
be analyzed and prioritized for risk response actions.  
Berlonghi \(1990\) suggests questions to ask to spark the discovery process  
include\:  
e Who is exposed to harm?  
e What is exposed to loss?  
¢ What could cause loss?  
¢ Who would suffer loss?  
e What are the consequences?  
Many risk management manuals and practitioners recommend the sorting of the vari-  
ous areas of risk into categories to make identification \(and analysis\) more efficient and nner EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  
36 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
effective. These categories could be activities, tasks, departments, event components,  
specifications, needs, objectives, key performance parameters, processes, or any num-  
ber of groupings. The risk manager must develop the types of categories that best suit  
the type, size, scope, and/or purpose of the event, and that best suits the stakeholders  
participating in the process. However, establishing a consistent set of categories, partic-  
ularly for recurring events, facilitates the development of a knowledge management  
system for continuous improvement.  
Risk identification tools and techniques  
Brainstorming  
A group technique for stimulating creative and intellectual ideas that may be used to  
identify risks using a group of team members, stakeholders, and/or subject matter  
experts wherein each participant’s ideas are recorded for later analysis. It is impor-  
tant to remember that this is an idea or item generation exercise, during which no  
evaluation of value or possibility should take place. Such critique will stifle the exer-  
cise and prevent the emergence of unique or unusual risk possibilities and potential  
opportunities and solutions.  
Documentation review  
All documentation generated for the current meeting or event should be reviewed  
\(see Table 2.3\). This should reveal areas and activities of concern, interactions and .  
integrated planning matters to be addressed, stakeholders to be interviewed or  
included in meetings, and gaps in the documentation appropriate for a meeting or  
event of this type or scope \(a risk factor in itself\). In addition, a retrospective analy-  
sis of lessons learned and historical data from past and comparable events will likely  
reveal risk factors and areas that need attention.  
Gap analysis  
An analytical tool used to detect gaps \(i.e., disparities or missing parts\) in the plans  
for or delivery of an event, its purpose is to determine any potential discrepancies

The risk management process, tools, and techniques 37  
between expected and actual performance and system deficiencies. The gap analysis  
is typically applied after an event, but its results from previous events will highlight  
areas and activities of concern.  
Hazard mapping  
This technique examines the event environment \(site, surroundings, structure, or  
systems\) for areas and items of concern. This exercise is particularly useful for iden-  
tifying health and safety hazards, as well as pointing out areas or activities that fos-  
ter combined risk factors or root causes for risks. This exercise should include those  
actually working in that or those environments \(e.g., staff and volunteers\) to garner  
practical input.  
Interviews  
Consultation with all department heads, key stakeholders, and others involved in  
the event operations is an important component of risk identification. Interviewing  
peers and subject matter experts can also be useful. These interviews could be con-  
ducted one-on-one or within a group setting and are used to determine existing con-  
cerns, identify risk factors, and establish what is or should be done about them \(and  
the resources available and required to deal with them\). Questions should be pre-  
pared according to the area of responsibility as well as a set of questions to be asked  
of each person interviewed, which might uncover difficulties, inconsistencies, mis-  
conceptions, misunderstandings, and conflicting assumptions.  
Risk assessment meeting  
This is a very effective method for the identification of risks. All participants in a risk  
assessment meeting should be required to complete any necessary pre-work, such as  
compiling risk lists or reports, and each participant should sign in so the risk man-  
ager has a record \(evidence\) of who was in attendance. The number and scope of the  
risk assessment meetings will depend on the size, scope, and type of event being  
produced. To ensure full participation, the risk manager should make certain all  
those in attendance are called upon to contribute their ideas and perspectives. This  
is often achieved by holding a brainstorming session wherein all ideas are accepted  
without critique until the later, analytical phase of the meeting. Using the ‘round  
robin’ method, a group technique wherein the members of the group are required to  
participate in a sequential manner, ensures all the members of the group will con-  
tribute to the discussion and will be heard.  
Scenario/tabletop exercise  
This is an exercise wherein participants are given a scenario or description of an  
event incident or situation and are asked to discuss and examine the causes, effects,  
and other implications by taking the scenario to its logical or worst case conclusion.  
This ‘What might go wrong?’ or ‘What's missing?’ analysis often reveals omissions  
or undesirable conditions and encourages participants to go beyond the ‘obvious’  
and penetrate further to identify and understand the risks, their root causes, and  
their potential outcomes.  
SWOT analysis  
This analytical tool examines the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats  
of past or comparable events, and identifies or predicts the advantages and defi-  
ciencies associated with the current or future event \(see Figure 2.6\). All identified a

strengths and opportunities should be capitalized on, and all weaknesses and  
threats should be carefully analyzed, addressed, and monitored.  
Work breakdown structure \(WBS\) review  
A typical project management tool, the WBS is the list of the activities, tasks, or work  
packages required to accomplish the event project. This ‘decomposition’ of the event  
elements into their task components provides a realistic and comprehensive overview  
of the scope of the event project and the resources necessary to complete it. The WBS  
should be examined in conjunction with the timeline or schedule and the critical path,  
showing deadlines for conducting certain actions in a logical and necessary sequence,  
to reveal inadvertent oversights and potential conflicts.  
Risk analysis  
In order to develop effective risk response and treatment plans within the con-  
straints of limited resources, the risk manager must analyze the identified risks to  
determine their causes, consequences, correlations, probability, and priority. Risks  
must be ranked to determine their order of importance or urgency so that the most  
critical ones will be addressed in the proper order according to legal, ethical, and risk  
tolerance parameters. The safety and welfare of people must always be the number  
one priority, with the loss of vital information second, particularly in an emergency  
situation. The loss of property, reputation, and finally, the financial investment in the  
event are usually less critical because they can likely be replaced.  
The analytical tools used consist primarily of three types\: root cause, decision, and  
influence analyses. These qualitative and quantitative methods are used to evaluate  
and estimate the reasons risks are present or arise; the likely occurrence and impact seen  
The risk management process, tools, and techniques 39  
severity of a risk; the criticality and time sensitivity of the risk; and other or overlap-  
ping areas affected by the risk item. It is advisable to consider a combination of ana-  
lytical tools so that risk drivers and residual or secondary risks are identified and a  
holistic and comprehensive understanding of the risks is achieved.  
Jeynes \(2002\) suggests that typical evaluation factors include\:  
¢ The people affected.  
e The extent of potential harm or damage.  
¢ The likelihood of occurrence.  
¢ The possible disruption of the event.  
¢ The likely impact on owners, stakeholders, or public image.  
e The urgency or immediacy of impact.  
¢ The ability to recover.  
¢ The cost implications.  
It is important to consider both the direct and indirect exposures when analyzing  
risks. Direct exposures are those that have an actual and immediate effect, such as  
actual or threatened injury or damage to persons, loss or damage to property, or  
injury or damage to the environment. Indirect exposures are those that have inci-  
dental or subsidiary effects such as economic, legal, or political impacts.  
Risk analysis tools and techniques  
Cause/effect analysis  
This is a graphical predictive or diagnostic analytical tool used to explore the root  
causes or factors that contribute to positive or negative effects or outcomes. The cat-  
egories can include environment, budget, time, and any other resource factors perti-  
nent to the end effect. The most typical form is the Ishikawa or fishbone diagram \(see  
Figure 2.7\), named for its developer Kaoru Ishikawa, a pioneer in quality manage-  
ment processes.  
Constraint analysis  
Constraints are the factors that limit capability or capacity and they fall into four cate-  
gories — scope, quality, schedule, and resources \(any may include political or regulatory  
constraints\). Each must be recognized and analyzed to determine its flexibility, priority,  
and impact on the decisions to be made regarding response options and actions. The  
adage ‘good, fast, cheap\: pick two’ illustrates that trade-offs will often be necessary.  
Decision tree analysis  
This evaluation tool describes a decision under consideration and examines the  
implications of selecting one risk response option over another \(see Figure 2.8\). Each  
alternative will have different costs, benefits, and secondary risks \(those that arise  
after the response has been implemented\), and must be analyzed based on their fea-  
sibility, cost, and schedule implications.  
Fault tree analysis \)  
Another form of the cause/effect analysis, this deductive tool begins with a conclusion,  
and then’attempts to determine the specific causes of this outcome \(see Figure 2.9\). 40 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

impact on the risk, as well as the risk drivers that affect numerous risk factors. LT aT SE TE SS SST SSS SSIS At a A SR

Influence diagram  
This graphical evaluation tool is similar to mind mapping and illustrates the effects  
and scope of interactions any one element or change will have on other event ele-  
ments, plans, and associated risks. Sometimes referred to as a relations diagram, this  
tool may also be used to help identify factors in a situation that are driving many of  
the other symptoms or factors \(see Figure 2.10\). The arrows start at the influencing  
factor and end at the factor being influenced. The factors with the most outgoing  
arrows will be root causes or drivers.  
Probability/severity matrix  
This tool is used to quantify the likelihood and impact of identified risks in order to  
prioritize risk response activities \(see Figure 2.11\). Experts advise that the probabil-  
ity should be evaluated first, followed by estimating the potential severity of the  
consequences. It helps identify the risks that are most urgent or must be avoided,  
those that should be transferred or reduced, and those it is reasonable to retain.  
This tool is often used to quantify risk by assigning numerical values to each block  
and then multiplying the probability by the severity to reach a risk score. It is help-  
ful to specify the precise meaning or range of each axis descriptor \(see Table 2.4\),  
often based on statistical information, cost estimates, and historical records, so that  
ratings based on expert opinions and historical data will be consistent. A rating scale  
can be established giving an evaluative score to each factor that prompts specific  
response or decision protocols. For example, if ‘certain’ had a rating of 0.9 and ‘cat-  
astrophic’ a rating of 0.9, the risk score would be 0.81. It might be predetermined that  
any score above 0.65 requires an alteration of the event plan or consultation with  
additional experts. 42 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

event management in general. Each decision must be a conscious decision, based on a  
solid cost/benefit analysis, not by default or evasion. Ignoring or deferring such deci-  
sions increases rather than decreases risk. The risk manager must identify and analyze  
treatment options and prepare and implement treatment measures until the risk is  
acceptable.  
Risk avoidance  
The removal of risk liabilities or hazards. This may be achieved through the modifica-  
tion or elimination of those elements, requirements, practices, or activities that cause or  
generate the risk. It is not realistic to avoid all risks; events simply would not take place.  
The risk manager should consider methods that remove or decrease risk sources, sub-  
stitute less hazardous options, or modify the concept, specifications, and/or proce-  
dures until the risk is acceptable when contingency plans are in place. For those risks  
that are extreme or very high and cannot be modified, it is prudent to abandon or can-  
cel those elements.  
Risk reduction  
The mitigation or lessening of the impact of a risk by reducing the probability or likeli-  
hood of its occurrence and minimizing the severity of its consequences should it occur.  
Loss prevention methods may be employed including various forms of protection  
strategies, security and supervisory personnel, and protective equipment and devices.  
Risk diffusion and/or separation tactics may be used in which vulnerable objects or  
operations are segregated or relocated. Contingency plans may be made that ensure the  
availability of redundant or alternative equipment or services.  
Risk retention  
The conscious acceptance of a risk without engaging in any special effort to control  
it and retaining financial liability for losses that may occur. This does not mean that  
these risks may now be ignored. Acceptance still requires monitoring to ensure the  
risk does not become unacceptable or increase in its significance. Sufficient resources  
to overcome a risk should it occur must be allocated, as must sufficient funds be allo-  
cated to pay for losses should they occur. 44 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Risk transference  
The reallocation or transfer of the liability for and the impact of a risk to a third party.  
Also known as risk deflection, this is typically achieved through contractual transfer,  
purchase of insurance coverage, use of waivers of indemnity, or joint venture or part-  
nership structures. Depending on the type of transference, an additional risk may arise  
as the entity to which the risk has been transferred may not have sufficient resources or  
risk control capabilities to effectively manage the risks now under its jurisdiction.  
Other response plans that should be in place include contingency plans, crisis plans,  
and recovery plans. Contingency plans are the strategies and arrangements made to  
deal with and recover from uncontrollable known risks and unforeseen risks. A crisis  
plan is the formal record of agreed upon emergency management roles, responsibili-  
ties, strategies, systems, and arrangements. Recovery plans define the recovery  
activities, typically including workaround or deactivation strategies and continuity  
measures, which will allow the event organization to resume its business operations.  
Risk monitoring and control techniques  
There should be a monitoring system, activity, or process specified for every risk identi-  
fied, and these may aid in identifying and responding to risks that have not been identi-  
fied \(see Table 2.5\). Monitoring systems should also supply data for subsequent feedback,  
review, and evaluation activities for the refinement of future risk management plans.  
Control measures are those physical, behavioral, and procedural actions, devices, -  
strategies, and systems employed to prevent or reduce loss \(see Table 2.6\). Control  
measures must be continuously monitored and evaluated as closely as the hazards  
or risks they are designed to control.  
Risk documentation techniques  
Documentation is the formal recording of information, and this information is an event  
asset — an incredibly valuable resource that must be collected and protected properly.  
Documentation exists in many forms including written documents, graphical repre-  
sentations, audio recordings, video recordings, and photographs. Typical documenta-  
tion includes records, reports, evidence, and evaluations. The techniques for ensuring  
this documentation is generated and collected properly rely on incorporating these  
procedures into the event's operations and administrative functions \(see Table 2.7\).  
Historical records comprise the information assets and institutional memory of an  
event. Whether this information is kept in a sophisticated computer system or on vari-  
ous checklists, forms, pieces of paper, or note cards, effective risk management dictates  
establishing policies and procedures for acquiring and protecting these assets.  
¢ What to get\: Information to get includes all the specifications, contact details, com-  
munications, instructions, reports, checklists, and other paperwork associated  
with the event.  
¢ What to keep\: Information to keep includes anything that is mandated by law or has  
an impact on or provides verification of the event operations.  
¢ Why keep it\: Reasons for keeping this information include planning, operational,  
and archival functions as well as legal, ethical, risk management, and fiduciary  
responsibilities. How to keep it\: Records must be sorted and stored appropriately so the information  
in the records is accessible to those who need it — but ONLY to those who need it,  
in compliance with privacy and proprietary information requirements. —\_—e————— ener

Reports are a written account or record of information gathered or actions taken.  
They should facilitate the timely and efficient distribution of information to those  
who need it. They should also be required to ensure the timely and efficient collec-  
tion of information from those charged with specific duties and tasks to perform.  
\* Status reports should be linked to critical milestones in the planning process and  
the trigger points in risk response plans.  
° Risk analysis reports should include conclusions and recommendations, and must  
be timely and convincing.  
° Post-event reports should also include conclusions and recommendations, plus all  
the supporting documentation necessary to verify and/or confirm those conclu-  
sions and recommendations, as well as any necessary evidentiary materials.  
¢ Ad hoc reports may be necessary from time to time in order to track risk response  
and control functions.  
Proper evidentiary documentation will become critically important for the prompt  
and satisfactory resolution of commercial or legal disputes \(see Table 2.8\). From the  
boardroom to the courtroom, this documentation may facilitate independent audits,  
provide proof of compliance with regulatory requirements, and demonstrate that  
proper procedures were employed. ee lS SSS  
The risk management process, tools, and techniques 47  
Table 2.9 Typical evaluation techniques  
Analyses The various analyses conducted should be re-examined to determine the efficacy  
of the assumptions and conclusions  
Feedback In order to get feedback you must provide the mechanisms and systems for  
receiving feedback \(suggestion boxes, meetings, surveys, focus groups, etc.\)  
Interviews Interviewers must be provided with the questions to ask that will glean the  
information desired or required  
Performance audits Post-event meetings Questionnaires The quality, quantity, timeliness, and capability of all products, services, personnel,  
and providers should be assessed  
Post-event meetings \(debriefings\) are a primary method for collecting anecdotal  
information, expert reviews or analyses, and important feedback  
A set of open-ended and closed-ended questions allow opinions, attitudes, and  
observations to be collected efficiently and anonymously \(if desired\)  
Reports and Reports and reviews must be purpose-specific and properly structured in order to  
reviews gather the desired intelligence  
Statistics Statistical data must be captured efficiently and effectively — in order to count you  
must plan to count. Incorporate the collection of data for your reports in your  
standard operating procedures and implement measures to capture numbers and  
Statistics.  
Evaluation is the process of critique and measurement or rating against established  
values. Typical evaluation methods such as questionnaires, interviews, and statistics  
are primarily used for a post-event evaluation, but may also be used in risk monitoring  
functions in combination with techniques such as status reports and observation. All  
evaluation techniques include the collection and analysis of information \(see Table 2.9\),  
which must be scheduled appropriately and the results distributed properly on order  
to be effective.  
Every health or safety law or code has been the result of examining and evaluat-  
ing the causes and results of disasters, and every improvement or best practice orig-  
inated with trial and error. It is vital that one continually learns from the tragedies  
and triumphs, large or small, of each event. This can only happen if the information  
is recorded, analyzed, and taken forward as lessons learned.  
# Summary  
Risk planning should be as robust as the event planning. In order to create effective  
risk response plans for an event, a systematic process must be employed that identi-  
fies the potential risks, analyzes their causes and effects, and evaluates the options  
suitable for responding to each identified risk. Response plans must specify the trig-  
gers that will instigate a response, the procedures to be followed, and the person or  
personnel responsible for implementing the response.  
Consultation and collaboration with stakeholders increases the efficacy of risk  
assessments and facilitates effective communication strategies. Documentation  
provides the data required to verify and validate decisions and risk management  
activities, and significantly contributes to the ability to learn from successes and fiascos.  
The risk management tactics, tools, and techniques employed to protect assets and  
individuals from loss, harm, death, or destruction and to protect the event from eer S  
48 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
disruption, disgrace, or demise must be thoroughly and carefully considered from the  
inception through the production of the event. This can be an awesome and intimidat-  
ing responsibility, but by systematically conducting risk identification, analysis,  
response planning, control, and evaluation activities, this sometimes overwhelming  
duty will become manageable and instinctive.  
Key strategies  
¢ Prepare a comprehensive plan for managing risks so that you and your stakehold-  
ers have a clear understanding of the resources that will be required.  
¢ Involve and consult your key stakeholders and suppliers in the risk assessment  
process.  
¢ Every risk requires a decision on how to respond; deciding not to decide is usually  
a bad decision.  
e Link risk monitoring tactics to key decision points in the event management plan  
and timeline.  
¢ Make certain all event personnel know they have permission and the obligation to  
report risks they observe and will not be punished for doing so.  
¢ Information does not become usable intelligence unless it is properly captured  
and capable of being transmitted to others.  
e Use a variety of methods for identifying and analyzing risks to increase the qual-  
ity and effectiveness of your risk assessment.  
¢ Retain only those risks whose outcomes you can afford.

XYZ Bank will hold its annual awards gala banquet on the first Saturday in February  
at the convention center in the downtown of a metropolitan city to celebrate the  
accomplishments of their top performers in customer service. You are serving as  
the risk manager for this event, working with the event organizer hired by the bank.  
The event concept is as follows. . .  
After parking in the convention center's parking garage and making their way past  
two large exhibit halls \(expected to be in use during the day\), the 500 guests will  
arrive to alarge decorated entryway at the ballroom and check in at the welcome desk LT  
50 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
staffed by bank volunteers. Upon collecting their name tags and two drink tickets  
each, guests will enter the pre-function area and may check their coats for the evening  
at a commercial coat check service. Four bars will serve drinks and wait staff will pass  
hors d’oeuvres during the cocktail hour while a lounge singer performs accompanied  
by piano.  
When it’s time for dinner, guests will be welcomed into the ballroom decorated  
like a swank and elegant nightclub to the swinging sound of a 13-piece big band  
orchestra. Sixty well-dressed tables highlighted with pin spotlights rigged into the  
ceiling will surround a large dance floor in front of the stage. The tables are to be set  
with crisp white linens, floral centerpieces, and pre-set salads, surrounded by seats  
covered in striped Spandex to disguise the standard banquet chairs.  
The focal point of the ballroom will be a large three-level stage jutting out into the  
room on an angle, flanked with stairs for the award-winning guests to ascend to  
accept their richly deserved recognition. Extending out on either side of the stage  
will be two large rear-projection video screens to provide simultaneous video of  
speeches, entertainers and award winners captured by a cameraman with a hand-  
held video camera, and selected graphics to document the award ceremonies and  
entertainment attractions will be interspersed via PowerPoint® slides. The screens  
will be flanked with giant white floral displays on top of massive eight-foot tall  
white pedestals, highlighted with colored up-lighting from instruments at their  
base. The loudspeakers for the sound system will be arranged in stacks at the far  
edges of the screens against the wall.  
As guests finish their main course the awards ceremonies will start. Follow spots  
and recorded music will escort each winner up to the stage, and the simultaneous  
image magnification video will provide a close-up view for everyone in the audi-  
ence. To punctuate between the two types of awards to be presented, a fabulous and  
fun dessert parade will take place with the wait staff making a grand entrance and  
snaking through the tables with carts bearing flaming cherries jubilee to the sound  
of rousing music.  
After the awards ceremony the rest of the evening will feature the orchestra play-  
ing dance music to get guests out on the dance floor to demonstrate their ballroom  
best under the sparkling stardust ballroom effect of a mechanized mirror ball sus-  
pended above. The grand finale will be a balloon drop of 250 brightly colored bal-  
loons to signal the end of the evening at 11\:00 p.m.  
The convention center will be responsible for the setup of the tables and chairs by  
8\:00 a.m. the day of the event, and its in-house caterer will be responsible for the  
food and beverage service. Everything else is contracted from outside vendors,  
and there is one day to get everything installed and ready to go by the 6\:00 p-m.  
start time.

These claims from companies selling guides on how to start a business organizing  
meetings and events make it look easy, glamorous, and very profitable. Not one of  
them, however, mentions the liabilities associated with the job, nor do they point out  
the financial and legal consequences of failing to exercise proper duty of care toward  
the attendees, staff, clients, and others at the event. ‘I didn’t know’ will not excuse them  
in the boardroom or the courtroom.  
Tens, hundreds, or thousands of people are entrusted to your care when you plan  
an event. Lack of attention, lack of judgment, lack of caution, and lack of wisdom can  
all contribute to negligent behavior by the event organizer, leaving the organizer and  
the organization exposed to serious penalties, even imprisonment. The four chapters  
in this section will introduce you to the range of responsibilities that fall upon event  
organizers to ensure that they have done everything within their power to protect  
the safety, security, and welfare of all those involved in an event project. = = ee \*

# Introduction  
Events are part of the social fabric of our lives and part of that fabric is law and order.  
Countries, provinces, prefectures, states, cities, and municipalities make laws to serve  
the common good and protect their citizens from harm. Many of these laws will affect  
the way in which an event may be designed and implemented. There might be laws that  
govern where an event may be held, when an event may be held, what activities may  
take place, how the event site must be laid out, and what safeguards must be in place  
to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of those in attendance. It is incumbent upon the  
event organizer and event organization to ensure compliance with these laws, and it is  
best practice to embed the appropriate safeguards into the very design of the event.  
It must be clearly understood that the material covered in this chapter, and through-  
out this book, is not to be construed as legal advice, and may or may not be pertinent to  
your event or the jurisdiction in which your event is being held. You should always  
consult qualified legal counsel and the appropriate authorities when considering the  
issues presented herein. Legal counseling is a highly specialized and often jurisdiction-  
specific profession. The importance of proper legal counsel increases exponentially as  
an event increases in scope and/or crosses borders and changes language, especially in  
contracts. 56 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Legal responsibility  
The legal obligations associated with event management includes the negotiation  
and execution of the contracts and other legal documents associated with the acqui-  
sitions and endeavors of the event project, and oversight of the lawful design and  
implementation of the policies, procedures, and practices of the event organization  
and its representatives. The organization and production of meetings and events  
carries with it significant responsibilities to ensure the protection of the personal and  
property rights of others — those involved in the event and those impacted by the  
event. It is critical to understand the nature of legal liability and carefully consider  
the duties associated with accepting and controlling event liabilities.  
# Liability  
Liability simply means the legal responsibility for one’s actions and omissions \(and  
financial obligations\), and the obligation to compensate the person harmed by those  
acts or omissions. In other words, if one does something or fails to do something in  
connection with one’s implicit or explicit duties that results in injury or harmful con-  
sequences, that person or entity is open to a civil lawsuit to recover damages or may  
be subject to criminal prosecution. Contractual liability is the legal responsibility to  
meet one’s financial and performance obligations included within a contract.  
Professional liability may result from misrepresentation or the failure to inform, pro-  
vide accurate information, investigate, or deliver \(Foster, 2002\). Tort law is concerned  
with wrongful acts or non-contractual duties that allow an injured person to obtain  
compensation from the person or entity that caused the harm or loss. Intentional torts  
\(wrongs\) are typically not covered by liability insurance. Contract law deals with  
breach of contract liabilities.  
It is important to properly assign the liability for those duties or activities that the  
event organizer does not have reasonable control over. ‘\[E\]ach party should be  
responsible for their own acts of negligence or willful misconduct, and each party  
should indemnify the other party from such acts’ \(Connell, 2002, p. 127\). This is done  
through the contractual process, ensuring that those providing goods and services  
take responsibility for their actions and the suitability and safety of their products or  
offerings by including the appropriate contract clauses defining these responsibili-  
ties and expectations. For example, it is considered best practice to have contract lan-  
guage that specifies the hotel or caterer selling and serving alcohol at the event will  
be in full compliance with all applicable liquor laws or for pyrotechnics providers to  
be contractually required to be fully licensed, secure the proper permits, and provide  
specific levels of insurance coverage.  
Duty and degree of care  
Everyone is expected to conduct themselves in such a way that their actions do  
not injure others, and this applies to entities such as event organizations as well.  
As noted in Chapter 2, duty of care is the legal requirement that everything ‘reason-  
ably practical’ has been done to protect safety and health. When the standard of care  
has been breached by act or omission, the resultant liability is often assessed in  
degrees of negligence \(see Figure 3.1\). SS SSS«ST CS "=a REEL LAA A LL EC AE A nemianneaaniataes

Willful misconduct Deliberate disregard  
Gross negligence Reckless indifference  
Negligence Failure to act reasonably  
Figure 3.1 Breach of duty of care scale  
Degree of care, the standard or level of caution or forethought, is based on the cir-  
cumstances and evidence of the duty to act. The act of producing an event and invit-  
ing individuals to attend that event provides the evidence of the duty to act. Those  
who put themselves forth as professionals are often subject to a higher standard than  
an ordinary person because they are expected to have specialized knowledge and  
experience. Event organizers are expected to be able to foresee risks, assess their  
potential for causing injury or harm, take actions to mitigate that potential, and have  
a duty to warn individuals of known hazards.  
Due diligence  
Due diligence is the thorough and objective investigation to determine the accuracy  
of claims made by parties to a transaction and to evaluate the financial and organiza-  
tional stability, the conditions that may cause harm, and the technical capacity  
and/or infrastructure necessary to deliver on those claims. Event organizers conduct  
these investigations to ensure they are making prudent plans and purchases. They  
must be able to illustrate that they have conducted them in accordance with their  
duty of care responsibilities in order to mitigate any claims of negligence. This is  
applicable to the selection of the site, service providers, equipment, materials, and  
even the event components or attractions. Foster \(2002\) advises that event organizers  
should have documented evidence of due diligence activities such as safety and secu-  
rity checklists and that safety and security matters should be discussed and included  
in contracts. EEE  
58 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Laws, codes, and regulations  
Legislation and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from event item  
to event item. In addition to legislation, certain venues have rules and regulations  
that the event and event organization must adhere to in order to use their property.  
The risk manager must do the research necessary to determine what will be applica-  
ble to the event, where that event is taking place. Ignorance of the law is NO defense!  
There may be legal restrictions on what types of special effects are allowed, the  
construction of temporary structures such as grandstands or viewing platforms, and  
where smoking may and may not be allowed. There may be venue restrictions on  
what signage may or must be posted or what sponsor banners may be displayed,  
which food providers may be used, and which workers are allowed to perform what  
tasks. There may be specifications on how loud or late music may be played, how  
many portable toilets must be provided, and where guests are allowed to park. The  
risk manager should check with the venue, suppliers, and authorities to determine  
the pertinent regulatory requirements \(see Table 3.1\).  
These statutory and regulatory issues may apply to only certain types of events or  
certain types of sponsors or hosting organizations. For example, in the U.S., if organ-  
izing an event for a governmental agency or publicly owned company, all records  
surrounding an event may be subject to public disclosure, even those of the vendors.  
Specific records or all records might be subpoenaed in cases brought before the  
courts \(a significant reason that proper documentation and ethical business practices  
are vital\).  
Failure to adhere to the applicable laws, codes, and regulations could result in  
fines or penalties, the disruption or closure of the event altogether, and even civil or

The Le Race conviction  
In August 2003 New Zealand event organizer Astrid Andersen was convicted of criminal nui-  
sance and fined \$10000 in connection with the death of a participant at the March 2001 Le  
Race, a commercially organized 100 km cycling event from Christchurch to Akaroa. Thirty-  
one-year-old Vanessa Caldwell collided with an on-coming car on a blind bend while over-  
taking other competitors and was fatally injured. The court found that Ms. Andersen did not  
do enough to ensure competitors realized the road was not closed to other traffic. Although  
overturned on appeal in 2004, the conviction caused numerous sporting events to postpone or  
cancel their events for fear of liability as a result of an accident.

Contracts and other legal  
# documents  
The risk manager must determine what contracts, agreements, and other legal doc-  
uments are legally required and are standard and customary for the event operation,  
and then confirm that all the necessary legal documents associated with the event  
have been executed properly \(see Table 3.2\). This could include anything from  
engagement agreements with entertainers outlining such things as length of per-  
formance, encores, equipment needs, appropriate dress and behavior, or even spec-  
ifying the appropriate material or content, to confidentiality agreements requiring  
employees, volunteers, and participants to protect proprietary information or pre-  
vent disclosure of design details.  
Contracts  
It is best practice to have a written contract for any and all goods or services pro-  
cured for an event. A contract is an agreement between two parties, specifying the  
offer \(what will be done or given\), the consideration \(what will be paid or given in  
return\), and the acceptance of the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement  
\(see Figure 3.2\). It should specify what is to happen and when, what is to be provided  
by whom, who is to do what and when, what it will cost, and how you will come to  
terms should there be a disagreement about it \(procedures and remedies\).  
Given these dimensions of a contract, the purchase of a ticket or registering for an  
event should be considered a contractual agreement between the attendee and the  
event organization, which is why the wording on such items as tickets and registration np  
60 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
forms must be carefully considered and disclaimers regarding the limits of liability  
should be included in that language.  
A contract or legally binding agreement should result from negotiating the offer, con-  
sideration, and terms. A written contract is not a contract until signed \(accepted\) by  
both parties; it’s only an offer. Everything is theoretically negotiable, from the scope or  
quality of what is to be provided to the prices or rates for those goods and services  
offered and the accompanying terms and conditions. Make certain during negotiations  
that all fees and charges that might end up on the final bill are fully disclosed and are  
accurately reflected or limited in the final contracts, those you issue and those you sign.  
A confirmation letter may be used to clarify all the negotiated terms prior to the  
drafting of the final contract, but if signed by both parties it can constitute a legally  
binding agreement, and therefore, unless this is acceptable, it should clearly state  
that it is not intended to be the formal contract.  
Typically, the party making the offer will draft the formal contract \(often a standard  
template used by the company\), but the party accepting the offer can make changes  
prior to acceptance, which is in essence a counter-offer. Changes that are made after  
the contract has been signed by both parties should be added to the contract as an  
addendum or a separate letter of agreement signed by both parties. As Monroe \(2006\)  
notes, all items and costs are negotiable before the contract is signed; after it is signed,  
you have limited options for removing or improving any unfavorable items.

Contracts should contain anything that is important to both parties, and parties can  
agree to anything that is not illegal or against public policy \(Sorin, 2003\). As Hilliard  
\(2004\) notes, the contract will typically include a series of clauses that specify the  
precise expectations of each party and provide protections for one or both parties \(see  
Table 3.3\). It is advisable that all contracts, especially those representing a certain level  
of financial commitment or liability, be reviewed by competent legal counsel prior to  
execution.  
Force majeure \(French for ‘superior force’\) is the contractual clause that allows  
contract cancellation or termination without liability, upon written notice, when  
conditions beyond the control of either party occur that make it inadvisable, illegal,  
or impossible to perform under the terms of the agreement. This can include acts of  
God \(e.g., flood, drought, earthquake, lightning, etc.\), war, terrorism, outbreaks  
of disease, epidemics, government regulations, disaster, fire, strikes, civil disorder,  
Tabie 3.3. Important contract clauses  
Indemnification Insurance Permits and licenses Dispute resolution Choice of law and venue Agency Cancellation, attrition, and liability transfer Termination An indemnification clause may protect against liability  
resulting from alcohol liability, ADA violations, and  
intellectual property infringement.  
Specify the types and limits required of the other party.  
Request a copy of their certificate of insurance, but  
specify that failure to receive one does not waive the  
insurance requirement.  
Specify the types of permits or licenses required of the  
other party. Require a copy, but specify that failure to  
receive it does not waive its requirement and may  
constitute a default or breach of contract.  
Specify how contract disputes are to be resolved, which may  
include negotiation, mediation, binding arbitration, or  
litigation.  
It is expensive to litigate long distance. Specify which  
jurisdiction’s laws will govern the contract and where  
disputes and/or litigation will be handled \(typically where  
the contract is to be performed unless otherwise specified\).  
Contracts and agreements must be executed by only  
those having authority to do so \(i.e., authorized  
signatures by authorized representatives\). Specify who  
has authority to make changes to the contract. Ensure  
that there are procedures in place that prevent  
unauthorized persons from signing agreements.  
Pay careful attention to clauses that specify the damages  
and liabilities associated with conditions or restrictions  
\(e.g., cancellation and attrition clauses that specify  
monetary and/or liquidated damages, cut-off dates, and  
other deadlines\), and those that transfer liability \(e.g., hold  
harmless clauses\).  
Termination clauses should be in all contracts, specifying  
under what conditions either party may cancel the contract  
without liability, including force majeure language. i i a a ce  
62 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
curtailment of transportation facilities, or unavailability of necessary utilities. In  
light of current world events, the wording of traditional force majeure clauses may  
need to be expanded to stipulate precise parameters of force majeure language such  
as a disease outbreak with specific warnings by the World Health Organization, U.S.  
State Department, Centers for Disease Control, or the Department of Homeland  
Security advising against travel to the host destination \(Kopecky, 2004\).  
Tyra W. Hilliard, Esq., CMP, an attorney, educator, and consultant on issues of law  
and risk related to meetings and events offers the following advice\:  
A contract only encompasses the four corners of the document — in a legal contract dispute, the court often  
will make a decision on the meaning of the contract purely from what is contained within the four corners of  
the document. Parol, or external, evidence is often not allowed, even if it would serve to clarify or explain the  
intention of the parties.  
There are many types of clauses and, unfortunately, headers or titles are not used consistently so what ts titled  
‘Indemnification’ in one contract may be titled ‘Hold Harmless’ in another. This contributes to the confusion and  
frustration that many people have in reading, interpreting, and modifying contracts. In writing or reviewing a  
contract, it is important to use common sense — review the contract for what must be there in order to memorial-  
ize in writing what may have been discussed verbally. Then consider what legal protection is needed.  
Suppose an independent event or meeting planner is drafting a contract for event management services for  
a client to sign. Such a contract should include, at a minimum, full contact and company information for  
both parties, information about the scope of services, payment terms including amount and timing. These are  
the business terms. Next, the event planner should consider the legal issues and make sure appropriate  
clauses are included to address things like payment and damages to the event planner if the client cancels the  
event that is the subject of the contract. The contract should also address how changes in the scope of serv-  
ices \(greater or lesser\) will be made and how they will affect payment and deposit amounts. Finally, the con-  
tract should address liability issues including indemnification and insurance.  
If an event planner is contracting with an event venue, some contract clauses will be the same. The con-  
tract should still include full contact and company information for both the event planner’s organization and  
the venue, payment terms, and the space and services contracted for. The facility will also most likely require  
other terms and conditions governing the use of the venue such as what can and cannot be brought in to the  
building. Liability issues should still be addressed, including cancellation terms and damages, indemnification,  
and insurance. These are certainly not all of the terms and clauses that should be in either type of contract, but  
these are some examples of typical issues addressed in contracts. Legal counsel should be consulted before a con-  
tract is signed to ensure that the contract is fair and allocates risk appropriately between the parties.  
Contracts and agreements are a safeguard, protecting both the event organization  
and the person or other organization it is doing business with by establishing and  
clarifying expectations. If something is important to the success of the event, it  
should be in writing!  
Statutory and regulatory  
# obligations  
A statute is a written law enacted by a legislative authority, rather than one established  
by court cases \(common or case law\), which typically mandates, prohibits, or defines  
something. Regulations are rules, criteria, or requirements established as policy by offi-  
cial agencies or governmental authorities that are designed to control, direct, or manage  
certain activities rather than prohibit them. Sanctioning is the authorization, approval,  
or ratification given by a governing organization, often related to sports activities. LT SSeSessshunesiniessiamsnsesuusenssntassnsienenmnnsennssnt  
Legal and ethical compliance 63  
It is important to recognize that governments enact ‘tombstone legislation’ based  
on disasters \(including event disasters\) and other legislation based on activities and  
abuses that resulted in harm. Some of this legislation may have been originally  
intended for some other industry or situation, yet its wording makes it applicable in  
the event context. Likewise, other regulations are devised based on previous  
instances of injury, damage, or negative outcomes. In some cases it may be possible to  
secure an exemption from certain regulations by demonstrating to the governing  
authority that the nature or activities of the event are not truly applicable or will not  
subvert the purpose of the law. However, one must accept the limitations or condi-  
tions required by law when selecting an event site \(e.g., not being able to restrict pub-  
lic access to public building or providing notification of an outdoor concert to  
neighboring businesses and residents\) or event elements \(e.g., not being allowed to  
use open flames or providing a specific level of insurance coverage for carnival rides\).  
As previously shown in Table 3.1, there are numerous legal and regulatory issues to  
consider based on the type, size, site, and components of any specific event. It would  
take several volumes to cover all these issues and their relevance and implications in all  
locations, which is why it is incumbent upon the event organizer or risk manager to  
conduct the due diligence to identify those that are applicable. In addition, laws and  
regulations change from time to time with new legislation or rules superseding old or  
familiar requirements, particularly case law, which is developed via jurisprudence as  
lawsuits are brought before the courts. Berlonghi \(1990\) advises that at least one indi-  
vidual within the event organization be charged with the responsibility for maintaining  
a government affairs file that tracks the legislative and public policy matters pertinent  
to the event.  
Accessibility  
All events in the U.S. must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\),  
which specifies that all public accommodations must be accessible to those with a  
physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activ-  
ities\: walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, working, caring for  
one’s self, or performing manual tasks \(see Table 3.4\). In the U.K. events must com-  
ply with the Disability Discrimination Act \(DDA\). Most countries have adopted  
some form of barrier-free legislation, sometimes legislated on a jurisdictional basis.  
Certain attendees, participants, staff, and suppliers may have special needs that  
must be provided for in order to fully participate in an event and may require special  
services to facilitate their involvement. The layout of the site must meet the ingress,  
egress, and access needs of all those attending, participating in, or servicing the meet-  
ing or event. Review physical features, equipment, and emergency procedures for the  
handicapped during the site inspection. Architectural accessibility will or should be  
the responsibility of the facility. Program accessibility is the responsibility of the spon-  
soring organization of the meeting or event, which may include special or preferential  
parking, entrances, and seating; special assistive materials, devices, or equipment;  
and/or space allotments for special services and service providers.  
Antidiscrimination liability is not exclusive to the handicapped; it can apply to  
inequity based on race, color, creed, age, gender, sexual orientation, physical size, or  
physical deformities. It may be applicable to the policies surrounding the recruitment  
of employees and volunteers, the actions and reactions of event representatives, and  
the marketing of the event. Liability aside, sensitivity to and respect for the cultural  
differences within a given community or society and in other cultures can overcome ne EEE

many challenges when planning an event. These differences may be based in religion,  
ethnic background, historical tradition, and national, geographical, or organizational  
customs. The planning implications may encompass such things as\:  
¢ The scheduling and timing of the event or components of the event agenda \(e.g.,  
holidays, holy days, rituals or ceremonies, and protocol requirements\).  
¢ The foods and beverages to be served \(e.g., dietary needs and restrictions\).  
¢ The setting \(e.g., site restrictions, color usage, personal space requirements, and  
symbols or emblems\).  
¢ Behavior expectations \(e.g., dress codes, gestures, interaction, and etiquette\).  
Failing to consider and make arrangements for those with special needs is at the  
very least discrimination by neglect and failure to comply with accessibility regula-  
tions can lead to fines or injunctions against the venue and/or the event organiza-  
tion. The constituencies to consider include the attendees, participants, hosting  
organization or community, and other stakeholders that are important to the success  
and sustainability of the event. Provide a method for individuals with special needs  
to identify and describe their particular requirements using neutral language that  
does not highlight or ignore any specific disability. Review sensitivity training pro-  
vided for facility personnel and event staff regarding people with special needs.  
Intellectual property

\(see Table 3.5\). Intellectual property consists of original creations of the human intel-  
lect that are unique, recognizable, and reproducible. Intellectual property ownership  
is protected by law \(the tangible expression is protected, not the idea itself\), and even  
though these images or ideas may be the source for one’s own creativity, they may  
not be copied outright and used without permission of the owner.  
Intellectual property is often identified by symbols that indicate images or words  
may not be used without securing permission, and perhaps paying a licensing or  
usage fee \(see Table 3.6\). This has particular implications for meetings and their  
exhibits and audio-visual presentations, and theme development for special events.  
Meeting organizers need to ensure there is contract language that places liability for  
infringement on the presenter or exhibitor, and special event organizers must not use  
trademarked and other brand images or copyrighted material in the verbal or deco-  
rative components of themed events. In addition, event logos and names should be  
trademarked to protect them from misuse, counterfeiting of their products, and jeop-  
ardizing their reputation. Furthermore the information assets \(proprietary informa-  
tion\) of the event organization must be protected from loss, damage, or theft.  
Ray Verhelst of ConventionDisc, Inc. in Las Vegas, Nevada, offers the following  
advice about the digital copyrights and individual rights of those being taped when  
videotaping seminars\:  
Meeting organizers need to update their presenter waivers to include statements that place the sole respon-  
sibility for the rights to the content on the presenter. This means that any person speaking, showing a pres-  
entation, and/or handing out a document, must own the content or have verifiable rights to use that content  
within the scope of their presentation, including a statement that says the presenter can be recorded and dis-  
tributed regardless if it is for promotional or profit purposes. This means that when they build that exciting  
PowerPoint® presentation that they have secured the rights to all the images, quotes, and editorial text that  
might have been ‘borrowed’ to make a point, and all facts and figures from any research need to be approved  
for publication and distribution. You must make sure that your presenter is fully aware of this requirement  
and that by signing your waiver they will be claiming all this to be true.  
So often we see presenters that have taken video footage from television programs, commercials, and  
movies and used them within presentations to make a point. We see company logos, misuse of registered tag  
lines and trademarks, images captured directly from Google™, and countless passages from famous authors  
being thrown up on the screen with wild abandonment. When confronted with this problem in the post-  
recording session, they forgot they were being recorded and figured that the 50-100 people sitting in the room  
would never have any affiliation with these items so why worry. Not so. Large companies have entire depart-  
ments that do nothing but protect the company’s assets, which include logos, trademarks, and images. Movie 66 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

studios have extensive legal teams that do nothing but search the Internet looking for pirated content. A law-  
suit could bring terrible consequences to a small association.  
The second issue is for-profit presentations. When you ask someone to present at an event where attendees  
have paid a fee to hear others speak, you need to make sure your waiver releases you from any financial obli-  
gation to the presenter, unless you have agreed to some form of specific remuneration, and even then they  
must waive their rights to any additional compensation. This becomes particularly sticky when you have a  
presenter that earns their living by speaking on this very topic. In essence, you are asking them to provide  
you with free access to their livelihood.  
You must get the presenter to sign off on the rights to the recorded content and that you are under no obli-  
gation to account for any revenue \(tangible or intangible\) to the presenter so that the content that you have  
gained permission to use will fall under that release. This is critical to your organization's business model.  
Otherwise the presenter could claim that they were unfairly compensated based on the revenue you earned  
from their intellectual property.  
Whether you do a video and/or audio recording, you should notify all the attendees that the session is being  
recorded as a courtesy, allowing them time to opt out, but you are not required to obtain a release from every-  
one in the room. If we have the rights to record a session from the organizer and they have the rights to the  
content and permission to record the presenters, when an audience member is captured indirectly during a  
question and answer period, this is equal to journalism. But if we ask an attendee to give specific commen-  
tary directly into the camera, we then treat them as ‘on-camera’ talent and have them sign a basic waiver.  
Music licensing  
One of the most common copyright and licensing issues affecting the events indus-  
try is music licensing. Virtually all music is copyrighted and the performer, com-  
poser, and/or lyricist are to be compensated for the use of their creative property.  
Music licensing fees are paid to these artists through music licensing agencies or per-  
forming rights organizations \(see Table 3.7\). It is the host’s \(sponsoring organization\)  
responsibility to pay these fees, not the facility or the entertainer because they are not  
the ‘end user’ that caused the music to be performed. However, a client must be  
apprised of this or the event organizer could be subject to vicarious liability for  
unauthorized use. There are very limited exceptions regarding music licensing for  
private use, such as private social events including only family and friends, and cer-  
tain exemptions for educational or charitable purposes, but one should always  
check. Basically, if the event or event organization is making money while using it  
these fees need to be paid.  
¢ Applies to the copyright owner’s performance rights \(public performance of their  
songs\).  
¢ Synchronization, publication, mechanical \(recording\) rights are different.  
e Fees are based on type of performance and size of audience.  
e Violations can incur damages of \$50 000-\$100 000 or more per song.  
Privacy  
There is a vast amount of personal, proprietary, and public information associated  
with an event, which elevates the possibility that abuses of privacy could occur, par-  
ticularly given the electronic technology prevalent today. Governments around the  
world have adopted comprehensive information privacy protection rights such as  
the Australia Privacy Act, the Canadian Privacy Code, the European Union Data  
Protection Directive, and the proposed Asia-Pacific Privacy Charter. Rights of privacy a

in the U.S., in contrast, are a patchwork of federal and state statutes and common  
law decrees that both protect and imperil the rights to control the collection and dis-  
tribution of confidential information \(Gindin, 1997\).  
Protections from invasion of privacy and for user privacy in electronic contexts are  
applicable to many aspects of meetings and events, including web-based registra-  
tion, electronic payments, Web sites and blogs \(web logs\), and electronic marketing  
activities \(Foster, 2000\). Invasion of privacy torts \(wrongs\) include intrusion, appro-  
priation or misappropriation of identity for commercial purposes, false light public-  
ity, and public disclosure of private facts \(Tratos, 2004\).  
e Intrusion of privacy torts concern direct and indirect surveillance activities \(see  
Consider this... 3.2\) typically in connection with the monitoring of employee e-mail  
and other online communications — activities that could create liabilities for the  
employer in the form of breach of confidentiality, trade secret disclosure or misappro-  
priation, defamation, harassment, or copyright infringement. Monitoring policies that  
remove any employee expectation that such activities are private should be clearly  
specified in employee handbooks and employment contracts to prevent litigation.  
\* Appropriation relates to the rights of publicity accorded to celebrities, alive or  
dead, which is akin to intellectual property rights in that the celebrity’s persona  
represents commercial property value. This can apply to ‘look-alikes’ and ‘sound-  
alikes’ as well as catchphrases used in marketing or publicity materials.  
Misappropriation occurs when an otherwise private person’s likeness or name is  
used without consent, and ‘use of likeness’ waivers and cautionary language  
should be included in registration materials or entry signage indicating visual or  
audio recording for commercial purposes will take place. senses  
Legal and ethical compliance 69  
¢ False light publicity concerns an embellishment, exaggeration, distortion, or fabri-  
cated association that places a person in an embarrassing, untruthful, and/or defam-  
atory light, which has significant implications regarding the control of event-owned  
Web sites, blogs, and discussion boards. The appropriate disclaimers should be  
included on these sites that limit liability for third-party statements.  
e Public disclosure of private facts relates not only to the disclosure of embarrassing  
facts. It concerns the very tenets of privacy rights — that a person should have con-  
trol over the collection and distribution of their own information and a person’s con-  
fidential information should be safeguarded by those who collect it. This includes  
the right to be informed of data collection and transfer, to limit what data is collected  
and how it will be used \(including secondary uses\), to have access to verify its accu-  
racy and make corrections, and to have it securely maintained according to its sen-  
sitivity through the appropriate administrative, technical, and physical procedures  
\(Awerdick, 1996; Canadian Standards Association, 1996; Foster, 2000; Gindin, 1997\).  
Event organizers must make certain that their data collection and protection activities  
in connection with attendees, employees, and volunteers are conducted so that only  
information relevant to the purpose is solicited, in a way that ensures confidentiality  
of personal information, and that this information is used only for the purpose for  
which it was acquired. This is extremely important regarding electronic financial  
transactions, which have special duties of confidentiality and require encryption and  
other security measures. Considering the grave concerns over identity theft and the  
proliferation of intrusive electronic marketing practices, it would be prudent to  
develop and implement a privacy policy that encompasses all aspects of an event  
organization’s operations.

Smart badges and tickets\: benefit or concern?  
Radio frequency identification \(RFID\) technology provides numerous benefits but poses seri-  
ous security and privacy concerns. RFID technology uses chips \(tags\) encoded with informa-  
tion that corresponds with an attendee registration file, which are embedded in name badges  
to track attendance, exhibit visits, and other data mining activities using tracking antennas  
known as readers. At the 2005 Professional Convention Management Association Annual  
Meeting held in Hawaii, 2600+ attendees were personally greeted on plasma screens, shown  
audience counts and demographic profiles at plenary sessions, and had their continuing edu-  
cation unit credits tracked using RFID tags in their badges \(Ball, 2005\). Event organizers of the  
Tennis Masters Cup 2005 held in Shanghai used RFID tags embedded into tickets to reduce  
counterfeiting and to automate and accelerate patron’s entry into the Qi Zhong stadium;  
100000 ticket-holders waved their tickets past readers positioned at the stadium’s 16 auto-  
mated gates for admittance \(O’Connor, 2005\).  
However, three researchers that were able to obtain official badges, which included RFID  
chips, for the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society in Switzerland with fraudulent  
identification documents \(using names from an attendee list printed on the summit’s Web site\),  
expressed grave concerns over the non-disclosure of the embedded chip and the potential for a ——

illicit tracking of the movements of the prime ministers, presidents, and other high-level offi-  
cials in attendance, especially considering the lax registration security \(Hudson, 2003\).  
AUS. congressional report noted, ‘key privacy issues are notifying individuals of the exis-  
tence or use of the technology; tracking an individual’s movements; profiling an individual's  
habits, tastes, or predilections; and allowing for secondary uses of information. ... Without  
effective security controls, data on the tag can be read by any compliant reader; data transmit-  
ted through the air can be intercepted and read by unauthorized devices; and data stored in  
the databases can be accessed by unauthorized users’ \(GAO, 2005, p. 7, 23\).

Compliance management  
Compliance management encompasses the acquisition, proper display, and reten-  
tion of the necessary permissions and documents such as permits, licenses, written  
exemptions, and other instruments that demonstrate adherence to all accessibility  
mandates, property rights requirements, and other applicable statutes, codes, and  
regulations to signify the event project is being conducted in accordance with perti-  
nent statutory and regulatory obligations.  
Licenses, permits, and other compliance instruments  
Events often require a variety of compliance instruments or permissions in order to  
take place \(see Table 3.8\). These permissions are not merely a matter of bureaucratic  
formality; they are control mechanisms to ensure the activities or uses for which they  
are issued will be in compliance with the laws and regulations governing such activ-  
ity or use \(Berlonghi, 1990\). They warrant that those holding the event and provid-  
ing goods and services to the event have the competency and authority to do so. Legal and ethical compliance 71  
Many events sell merchandise associated with the event and may issue or obtain  
licenses that control the product quality and the images on them. Sports events often  
seek authorization or ratification by a sanctioning or governing sports authority. Events  
involving potentially hazardous activities or children’s programming will often require  
participants to sign waivers or consent forms acknowledging the associated risks and  
releasing the event organization from liability. Make certain that waivers of indemnity  
are provided to participants early enough so that they have sufficient time to consider  
the risks before they invest in the activity.  
Permit or licensing authorities may include health inspectors, law enforcement  
authorities, traffic or parking agencies, fire marshals, parks and recreation divisions,  
and/or other governmental departments. Check with the venue, suppliers, and  
authorities to determine the permits required and the process, cost, and time required  
to secure the necessary compliance instruments. Collect and retain all documents and  
documentation surrounding compliance with occupancy and regulatory issues.  
Permits are typically required for\:  
Public assembly \(e.g., demonstrations, rallies, protests\)  
Public property or space usage \(e.g., parking lots, parks, public buildings\)  
Encroachment on the public right of way \(e.g., roadways, streets, sidewalks, medians\)  
Usage of municipal or public services \(e.g., police, traffic control, power, water\)  
Installation of a temporary structure \(e.g., staging, tenting, grandstand\)  
Installation of an air supported structure \(e.g., inflated ‘bouncy’ attractions\)  
Soliciting money \(e.g., fund raising activities\)  
Sales of goods or services \(e.g., merchandise\)  
Sale or serving of alcohol  
Sale or serving of foods  
Fireworks usage \(e.g., indoor pyrotechnics, outdoor or aerial displays\)  
Open flame usage \(e.g., bonfires, fire torches\)  
Animal attractions \(e.g., petting zoos, pony rides, animal entertainers\).  
Many municipalities have established a special events department that manages the  
application for and issuance of all event-related permits, and often have brochures,  
Web sites, or manuals that indicate policies, fees, and timelines. In various jurisdic-  
tions and for certain types of events, some applications must be submitted as much  
as six to eight months in advance, while others range from 30 to 120 days prior to the  
event. Sometimes a single meeting with all the applicable agencies may be possible  
and sometimes separate meetings with individual departments or authorities is  
required. Some jurisdictions hold these meetings on an ‘as needed’ basis and others  
might only hold them periodically.  
Some permit or license applications are short and simple; others may be lengthy  
and complex. There may be conditions and requirements that must be met in order  
to secure the compliance instruments necessary for the event, such as providing  
proofs of financial ability, insurance coverage, site plan approvals, and/or current  
business or other licenses. Permits may be issued on a conditional or temporary  
basis, requiring certain things be done, changed, or provided before the time of the  
event, in which case it is important to ensure these requirements are communicated  
to the appropriate vendors and/or event personnel so that they will be implemented  
and monitored.  
Certain officials might need to conduct on-site inspections to comply with the terms  
of the permit or license. Health inspectors may need to review the food preparation i  
72 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
areas and waste management facilities. The fire marshal may need to confirm the  
actual layout matches the approved floor plan, as well as conduct flame tests on cer-  
tain materials to ensure they meet safety specifications. Arrangements must be made  
to accommodate these inspections and ease the inspectors’ access to the site and the  
event's records as necessary.  
Develop a good working relationship with the authorities, particularly those with  
whom you interact regularly. This could help facilitate speedy inspections and per-  
mit issuance, plus it may provide the opportunity to educate officials about the fac-  
tors unique to events that warrant exemptions and special approvals. One frustrated  
tent rental professional began holding seminars for local fire officials on tents and  
equipment typically used for events to show them the safety features and how they  
differ from the considerations typically covered in fire codes. These became a win-  
win activity for both parties because the fire fighters could receive continuing edu-  
cation credit for attending \(Hurley, 2004\). Building this relationship could also  
provide you with important education based on their perspectives and expertise  
that will improve your practices and procedures.  
Securing all the appropriate licenses and permissions can be costly, particularly as  
governments seek to increase revenues and decrease costs by imposing various fees  
and taxes on events that require administrative and municipal support services such  
as health and fire safety inspections, traffic management, and crowd control. Large  
public entertainment events such as festivals and concerts are the primary targets,  
but private, corporate, and association events face numerous charges and fees as  
well depending on the level of interaction they have with permitting and licensing  
authorities and the impact the event has on a community and its municipal services.  
No matter how bothersome or costly it may be to acquire these permissions, do not  
be tempted to avoid or circumvent the process; the potential cost of discovery is too  
great.  
It is very important to consider every aspect of the event plan and the event  
planning to ensure all decisions and activities are legally permissible, and that the  
appropriate contracts, licenses, and other documentation are in order. Get your  
permissions before you spend — make certain you are allowed to do what you  
want to do before too much time and money has been invested in the event, and do  
not promote your event until you have permission to hold the event. Create a check-  
list of permits and other compliance instruments each time for every event and  
develop bureaucratic cooperation by accommodating and educating your local  
authorities.  
Ethical issues  
Ethics encompass the judgments and choices made and the actions taken that reflect  
and enact beliefs of what is right versus wrong. Embedded in most codes of conduct  
for the event and other industries \(see Table 3.9\), these standards guide the decisions,  
negotiations, and activities in a way that promotes equitable practices and demon-  
strates the ethical values below\:

Ethical practices  
Using the word ethics as an acronym may help reinforce your understanding of the  
underlying tenets of ethical behavior and practices\:  
E  
I  
Equality — there must be equal access in all aspects of an event from procurement  
to participation, and there should be no discrimination or favoritism in your  
practices.  
Trust — trust is established when you prove that you do what you say you will do  
and deliver what you said you would deliver, taking responsibility for your  
actions and your obligations.  
Honesty — represent yourself honestly and appropriately, always telling the truth  
about your capabilities, your authority, the situation, or the costs associated with  
the event.  
Integrity — avoid deception and conduct your activities with honor by asking  
yourself if you would want your actions disclosed to your client or published on  
the front page of the newspaper.  
Clarity — set clear policies and procedures that specify what is acceptable and  
what is not, and ensure informed consent is accorded to all parties. Ln

S Sincerity — be straightforward, candid, and maintain a genuine respect for your  
colleagues, clients, customers, and competition.  
Ethical practices are based on precedent, custom, tradition, standards, and fairness.  
However, what is standard and customary can vary significantly in different cul-  
tures and different locations. And what is ‘right’ may often be a situational challenge  
subject to varying justifications. This is why policies and procedures should be  
established that define the proper code of conduct for your event activities and oper-  
ations \(see Table 3.10\). These policies should cover acceptable and unacceptable  
behavior, equal opportunity, financial requirements, procurement, and regulatory  
compliance, and these policies should specify how breaches will be handled.  
Sound and ethical practices will reduce risk exposure and help achieve the goals  
of risk management. From policies on accepting gifts and gratuities to meticulous  
bookkeeping procedures, establishing formal policies and procedures helps one  
conduct the affairs and business of the event operation in the proper manner. This  
not only reduces risk, it helps create and enhance your reputation as an event man-  
agement professional, instills public confidence, and raises the image and standards  
of the industry as a whole. 76 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics Scandal  
December 10, 1998\: Scandal broke out as the head of the coordination committee overseeing the  
organization of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games announced that several members of the  
International Olympic Committee \(IOC\) had taken bribes. It was alleged that the Salt Lake  
Olympic Bid Committee doled out gifts, all-expense-paid ski trips, Super Bow\] trips, health care  
benefits, 13 scholarships, jobs, questionable real estate deals, and thousands of dollars in cash to  
IOC members or their families in order to win the event. The controversy plunged the IOC and  
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee into embarrassing chaos for months. As a result of investi-  
gations conducted by the IOC, U.S. Olympic Committee, Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and  
the U.S. Department of Justice, 10 members of the IOC were expelled and another 10 were sanc-  
tioned, and a senior member of the U.S. Olympic Committee and the president and vice presi-  
dent of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee resigned. Although nothing strictly illegal had been  
done, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious and stricter rules were  
adopted for future bids with ceilings put into place as to how much IOC members could accept  
from bid cities.  
# Summary  
Operating an event and event organization legally and responsibly is a cornerstone  
of effective risk management, one of its primary goals. It is essential that all the legal  
and ethical obligations are properly identified, attended to, monitored, communi-  
cated, and documented to limit the liabilities inherent in meeting and event projects.  
Meetings and events may be splendid in nature, but they are serious business with  
serious consequences should something go wrong.  
Negotiating, crafting, and executing the appropriate contracts and written agreements  
requires careful attention to the details included in them so that the relationships built  
with them are fair and beneficial to both parties. They must be approached from the per-  
spective of a safeguard rather than an onerous task. They should clearly define the expec-  
tations and exemptions agreed to. Doing business without them is asking for trouble.  
Compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements reduces risk  
and illustrates care and respect for those in attendance and other stakeholders.  
Embedding these requirements into the event plan from its inception facilitates efficient  
permissions and effective performance. Failure to comply could jeopardize health and  
safety, the financial interests of the event, and the very existence of the event itself.  
Key strategies  
° Respect the personal and property rights of everyone directly and indirectly  
involved in the meeting or event project.  
\* Use written contracts or other legal documentation for all event business activities  
and transactions.  
e Ensure that the event organization has access to and use sel when appropriate. fessi \] 2

° Develop positive relationships with the regulatory authorities that have jurisdic-

special needs by asking the experts and the individuals that know them best.

# Introduction  
The event organizer and event organization is responsible for providing a safe and  
healthy environment for all those who have been invited to or are involved in the  
meeting or event. Loss of life and injuries sustained in structural fires, workplace  
accidents, and other disasters has been studied by experts for more than a century  
and has resulted in sound guidance on preventative measures. The same holds for  
illness caused by poor sanitary practices and exposure to unhealthy substances. This  
vast body of knowledge and the expertise of the public health and safety officials  
charged with enforcing the rules based on this research and guidance must be incor-  
porated into the planning and production of meetings and events.  
Prevention and mitigation are the first line of defense, which must be followed by  
proper monitoring and timely response procedures. Safety hazards are usually easy  
to see and typically have immediate consequences. Health hazards, however, are  
often harder to recognize because the effects of exposure may have delayed conse-  
quences \(Rossol, 2000\). It is incumbent upon the event organizer and risk manager  
to conduct the appropriate investigations and establish and/or enforce the appropri-  
ate policies and procedures to identify, mitigate, and respond to the health and  
safety hazards that may be inherent or emerge. It is also important to develop an  
organizational and operational culture that acknowledges safety as a priority and  
recognizes that safety is everyone’s responsibility. Seas sisssistrsissfsihsssstsssssnemmmen,

Life safety codes  
The International Safety of Life at Sea \(SOLAS\) Convention was first devised and  
adopted in 1914 in response to the Titanic disaster, and the National Fire Protection  
Association’s NFPA 101 \(Life Safety Code\) had its origins with its Committee on Safety  
to Life in 1913 in response to notable fires involving significant loss of life. The begin-  
nings of the National Electrical Code \(NFPA 70\) arose in response to fires associated  
with the introduction and usage of Thomas Edison’s light bulb in factories in 1879 in  
order to mitigate the hazards associated with electricity. These consensus codes have  
been developed based on research conducted by maritime, fire engineering, and con-  
struction associations worldwide, and have quantified and codified the strategies, life-  
saving devices and arrangements, and construction requirements necessary to ensure  
public safety.  
Although every country and community throughout the world has its own fire  
and rescue service and governing authority \(often referred to as the AHJ, Authority  
Having Jurisdiction\) and adopts its own standards or codes, lawmakers and fire offi-  
cials often rely on NFPA 101 as the foundation for public safety programs for life  
safety from fire and other emergencies. In addition to the U.S., NFPA codes have  
been adopted and adapted throughout the world including Asia-Pacific nations,  
Canada, European Union nations, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle  
East \(see Table 4.1\). The risk manager must confirm the applicable codes with the  
AHJ in the location where the event is taking place.  
Fire and rescue services, from volunteer fire brigades to national defense agencies,  
deal with more than just fire fighting. They are typically the first responders for  
structural collapses, hazardous material incidents, water rescues, and numerous  
other emergencies. They have the training and expertise to provide critical advice  
that will help event organizers ensure their events are in compliance with the codes  
developed to prevent loss of life due to fire, electrocution, or drowning.  
Fire inspection, prevention, and protection  
Fire safety is a primary consideration for all events, event sites, event workplaces, and  
event operations. It encompasses the prevention of fire as well as the safety of people  
and protection of property should a fire occur. Attention must be focused on the eee  
82 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
actions and equipment that will prevent a fire from occurring, as well as the ability to  
evacuate people and provide response access to fire fighters and their equipment. —  
In most jurisdictions, the mandated prevention and response requirements — the fire  
codes — are based on NEPA 101, which ‘addresses those construction, protection, and  
occupancy features necessary to minimize danger to life from fire, including smoke,  
fumes, or panic ... Achieving an acceptable degree of life safety depends on additional  
safeguards to provide adequate egress time or protection for people exposed to fire’  
\(NFPA 101, 2000, p. 23\). The code addresses the following aspects of fire safety\:  
¢ Detection  
Evacuation  
Inspection  
Notification  
Response procedures  
Response services  
Site contents  
Site layout  
Site maintenance  
Suppression.  
All event layouts should be evaluated by a fire marshal to ensure that the appropriate  
fire safety precautions and emergency plans are in place based on the type and scope  
of event taking place. A life safety evaluation is ‘\[a\] written review dealing with the  
adequacy of life safety features relative to fire, storm, collapse, crowd behavior, and  
other safety related considerations’ \(NFPA 101, 2000, p. 30\). Using Table 4.2 as a guide-  
line should help you evaluate event venues under consideration, and confirmation of  
proper inspections and compliance should be required from venue management.  
Although life safety evaluations consider a variety of fire prevention and fire sup-  
pression capabilities, of primary concern is the means of egress and the ability of  
occupants to exit safely and quickly if a fire or other emergency should occur. It is  
important to remember that in many circumstances a fire can become lethal in less  
than two minutes!  
Consider this... 4.1  
Bradford football stadium fire  
May 11, 1985\: A small fire developed into a flashover event within seconds and engulfed the entire  
grandstand at Bradford football stadium transforming it into an inferno that claimed the lives of  
53 people. When the fire broke out there was little reaction from the nearby crowd who watched  
it grow, apparently thinking the smoke was from a flare because smoke flares had become a typi-  
cal occurrence at the football matches. The blaze took only four minutes to grip the entire stand,  
with the flames moving quicker than people could walk, and escape was hampered even further  
because more than 3500 people were packed into the main stand area and the doors at the back of  
the stand were locked to try to stop people coming in without paying. The only fire extinguishers  
were in the clubroom, put there so that they could not be used by fans as missiles. The Bradford  
football stadium fire resulted in the U.K. Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.

Structural integrity  
The purpose of the event and its emotional qualities \(e.g.,  
competitiveness\), the duration and time of day of the  
event, and the activities to be conducted will affect the  
calculation of safe occupancy loads.  
Factors such as gender, age, physical capabilities, sensory  
capabilities, purpose for attendance/participation and  
commitment to activities are used to predict behavior in  
reaction to an emergency.  
The size and density of the crowd will affect movement  
ability, and this will be factored into the occupancy load  
allowed by the fire marshal. The occupancy load is the  
maximum number of persons for whom means of egress is  
provided \(allot at least 15 square feet/1.4 square meters per  
person; if occupant load exceeds 6000 a life safety  
evaluation may be required\).  
Arrival and departure patterns and volumes; ticketing policies  
and practices; counter flow, cross-flow, congestion, and  
queuing situations; and the physical dimensions, complexity  
\(e.g., wayfinding\) and contents \(e.g., seating\) of the building  
affect occupancy loads and evacuation flow capacity adequacy.  
Means of egress is a continuous and unobstructed way of  
exit travel from any point in a building or structure to a  
public way, which allows occupants to promptly exit a  
building or structure in the event of an emergency.  
Flow capacity is the volume of people able to go through a  
given space or route in a given amount of time under given  
circumstances and is affected by factors such as seating  
volume/configuration, stairs, ramps, passageways, route  
complexity, and the merging of flows along egress paths.  
The flow capacity diminishes as the crowd density increases  
because movement Is restricted.  
Visual and audible notification systems \(e.g., fire alarms,  
public address systems\) must be in place and have an  
emergency power source, their signals must be distinctive  
from other communication systems, and voice  
announcements must be capable of being effectively heard  
above the ambient noise level.  
The relative danger of contents or activities causing the  
start or spread of fire or the generation of smoke, gases, or  
explosion is evaluated based on the character of the  
contents, configuration, and the operations conducted.  
The number, functionality, and efficiency of suppression  
systems such as automatic sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers,  
and other fire-fighting equipment must be sufficient for the  
occupancy load and activities conducted.  
Permanent, temporary, and moveable structures and non-  
structural components \(e.g., lighting\) are evaluated based on  
static and dynamic load limits \(crowds and crowd sway,  
precipitation, wind, etc.\) and stability.

Facility condition Facility operations and personnel The general condition of the facility is evaluated, including  
the building’s features, maintenance and cleanliness, and the  
amenities and services offered to calculate their affect on  
evacuation and response capabilities.  
The amounts, actions, attitudes, and aptitudes of personnel  
are considered in terms of their care of, respect for, and  
rapport with the attendees, as well as their training and  
readiness to conduct emergency response procedures.

characteristic of the fabric was an attribute of the thread from  
which the fabric was woven or knitted and will not wash out.  
A factory-issued flame retardant certificate should be issued by  
the manufacturer.  
¢ Flame retardant means that a chemical is added or applied to a  
fabric to increase the resistance of that product to fire. These  
treatments are non-durable, meaning they can be removed by  
exposure to water or moisture and must be reapplied as  
needed, typically on an annual basis or upon washing.  
¢ Satisfactory fire resistance depends on proper identification of  
the precise content of the substrate and the proper application  
of the appropriate fire retardant chemical. Some fabrics and  
other products may not accept fire retardant treatments and  
therefore must be flame tested \(check with the local fire  
authority for flame testing standards and techniques\).

Fire prevention strategies include avoiding combustible materials such as flamma-  
ble décor \(see Table 4.3\), keeping all areas clear of rubbish or debris, and avoiding the  
misuse of electrical equipment. All flammable gas containers need to be properly  
secured to prevent falling and protected from accidental damage or intentional tam-  
pering. Use of open flames \(for lighting, cooking, etc.\), pyrotechnics, spark-producing LL LL CL EC NTT ELLE CANA tanontnamneneentneee

equipment, and other incendiary activities must be carefully monitored and con-  
trolled. Of particular note is the variety of products and display materials one might  
find in a trade show, especially cooking or equipment demonstrations and the dis-  
play of vehicles, which must have their electrical system disconnected and fuel tanks  
sealed and/or locked. Individual exhibitors must abide by the same fire code  
requirements as the event organizer.  
Fire detection systems include smoke and heat alarms, which should be placed  
throughout the event site in all hazardous, unoccupied areas without automatic  
sprinkler systems. This may include storage areas, backstage areas, and under  
stages, platforms, or grandstands. Fire officials will advise you on the need for these  
based on the size, location, and configuration of the event layout. Do not forget the  
value of an alert pair of eyes; ensure all volunteers, stewards, and security personnel  
are advised that they are part of the fire detection plan.  
Fire suppression systems such as sprinklers and extinguishers should be con-  
firmed at any facility used for the event. Extinguishers should be in a conspicuous  
and clearly visible location, unblocked and readily accessible for immediate use,  
located along normal paths of travel and exit, and installed on hangers, brackets, in  
cabinets, or secured on shelves \(never standing upright on the floor because a falling  
cylinder could break off the valve and become a missile hazard\) \(Safetyinfo.com\).  
There should be at least one fire extinguisher for every 1500 square feet of floor area  
\(Berlonghi, 1990\). Fire extinguisher types differ according to the type of com-  
bustibles causing the fire \(see Figure 4.1\) therefore the fire marshal should be  
advised of the type of materials that will be used at the event \(Berlonghi, 1990\).  
Lighting and visibility are critical in an evacuation situation \(evacuation will be  
discussed further in Chapter 6\), particularly regarding the illumination of exit signs  
and egress paths. Fruin \(1984\) reminds us that ‘line of sight becomes line of flight’ in  
emergencies. All escape routes and exits must be clearly visible, with an independ-  
ent emergency lighting power source. Never cover exit signage with décor, no mat-  
ter how unaesthetically pleasing that may be. Also keep in mind that smoke \(from a  
fire or used as a special effect\) may significantly impair visibility.

Night club disaster  
February 20, 2003\: Pyrotechnics set off by the heavy metal band Great White ignited the ceil-  
ing and soundproofing near the stage of the Station Club in West Warwick, Rhode Island. The  
audience initially perceived the fire as part of the pyrotechnic show, but flames engulfed the  
building in less than three minutes and the dense smoke rendered the lighted exit signs invis-  
ible. Rhode Island Governor Don Carcieri said that ‘the building went up so fast no one had a  
chance.’ Hundreds were left dead and injured as panicked patrons fled for their lives, jam-  
ming exits as they tried to escape the heavy smoke and fire. West Warwick Fire Chief Charles  
Hall stated that because the wooden structure was small and built before 1976, it was not  
required by law to have a sprinkler system. The nightclub fire triggered an overhaul of the  
state’s fire safety code that implemented stringent new regulations.

Assembly occupancy  
Any occupancy of a building or structure for a gathering of 50 or more persons is  
considered an assembly occupancy \(NFPA 101, 2000\) and subject to fire code regula-  
tions covering the type, number, and location of fire suppression systems, the types  
of materials that may and may not be used, the warning and communication sys-  
tems, and the condition and composition of evacuation routes. According to the U.K.  
Occupiers Liability Act of 1957 the occupier of premises has the legal duty to ‘see  
that the visitor will be reasonably safe using the premises for the purposes for which  
he/she is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there’ \(HSE, 1999, p. 185\).  
The occupancy includes all the areas used in conjunction with the event, including  
parking areas, staging areas, storage areas, and overnight camping areas. These codes  
are also applicable to open spaces and temporary or one-time event sites \(including  
tents and marquees\). The risk manager should also consider adjacent areas, even dif-  
ferent floors in a multi-story building, and the potential for fires or incidents \(e.¢.,  
transportation accidents\) affecting the safety of the event site.  
Considering the propensity for using unique venues as sites for events it is even  
more important to seek input from fire safety officials. The temporary or unusual  
nature of using such venues for an event may not have been considered when it was  
originally inspected for its primary use. These sites require an inspection as a key  
component of the risk assessment. The primary focus will be on the capacity, con-  
tents, and configuration of the event site. When inspecting a building or event site as  
an assembly occupancy, the fire official will be looking at, among other things\:

Although the probability for fire may be low in any particular purpose-built or  
unique venue, the potential for loss of life is extremely high. It is best practice to  
become familiar with the fire safety measures required in your jurisdiction and work  
closely with fire officials to confirm your event site and operations meet the highest  
possible standards. This need for cooperation also holds true for aviation, coastal,  
and law enforcement authorities as applicable.

India consumer fair inferno  
April 10, 2006\: Fire engulfed the three huge marquees packed with shoppers in which the five-  
day Brand India Fair \(a popular consumer goods show\) was held at Victoria Park in Meerut,  
India. Skepticism exists about the official toll but news reports proclaimed 52 dead and 131  
injured in the blaze that was purportedly started by a short circuit in one of the haphazard  
wiring systems supplying electricity to the air conditioners. The steel-framed tents shaped like  
aircraft hangars were about 100 meters long each, interconnected in a Y shape, with no emer-  
gency exits and only one entry-—exit corridor with stalls on either side. Although the organiz-  
ers received authorization from city officials to operate, they did not obtain the mandatory fire  
safety clearances from the city’s fire department. Arrest warrants on charges of homicide and  
criminal negligence were issued for the organizers of the fair, but they had fled after the fire.

Other safety hazards  
Anything and everything included in the event agenda or attractions and everything  
at the event site has potential safety implications. Injuries have occurred when items  
thrown into the crowd by participants on parade floats have struck spectators and  
others that run into the street to gather these souvenirs have been struck by float  
vehicles. Spectators rhythmically stomping at sports events can cause vibrations that  
result in structural weaknesses or knock over equipment. Fans seeking a better view  
of the stage might climb up on just about anything.  
Electrical installations with their tangled web of power cords and cables not only  
pose slip and trip hazards; they become a potential ignition source for fire and elec-  
trocution. Pressurized gas cylinders \(including those used for carbonated drinks\) eR  
88 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
can become missiles if they fall over and the nozzle breaks off, and inadequate light-  
ing can make hazards on pathways invisible and criminal behavior anonymous  
\(Silvers, 2004a\). All temporary structures and decorative items must be properly  
constructed and securely anchored. All equipment must be installed and operated  
correctly and protected from damage or misuse. Barriers must be placed around any  
fall or protrusion hazards and exclusion zones, and appropriate safety warning  
signs must be placed as required.  
Consider this... 4.4  
Grandstand disaster narrowly averted  
April 18, 1999\: The Three Tenors Concert in Pretoria, South Africa was delayed so that approx-  
imately 4000 audience members could be moved off five grandstands and re-seated else-  
where. Although two structural engineers had approved the structures as safe, just prior to the  
start of the performance parts of the scaffolding system were beginning to buckle under  
the weight of the audience. An observant security guard heard metal groaning, cut through  
the side webbing of the grandstand to inspect the area, and quickly communicated the situa-  
tion to the command center. Without hesitation the evacuation of the stands was ordered and  
within moments all available event staff started quietly asking people to exit the stands. This  
subdued and hushed evacuation was to ensure a panicked and rushed mass movement did  
not cause more damage, and was accomplished in less than 10 minutes.

Don’t forget Mother Nature. Severe storms can bring down power lines, high  
winds can send a tent crashing into people and hurl things hundreds of meters away,  
heavy rains can flood waterways or render open fields a massive mud puddle, and  
lightning can strike poles, towers, trees, or golfers trying to get that hole in one.  
Carefully consider the flora and fauna at any outdoor event site. Pests, pollens, and  
poisonous plants are only part the hazard picture. Low branches, thorny bushes, and  
unwanted animals are potential problem-makers, as is the health of the vegetation —  
falling tree limbs have caused serious damage and injury.  
Safety meetings and inspections  
During the risk assessment meeting\(s\) the risk manager needs to elicit all possible  
health or safety hazards associated with the goods, services, and personnel to be  
used to produce the event. Specifically ask all vendors and suppliers to identify  
potential physical hazards and the safeguards necessary to prevent exposure to ill-  
ness or injuries. Use this opportunity to communicate a commitment to safety in all  
aspects of the event. Reiterate this in contractual language and reinforce it on-site  
with safety meetings with all event personnel, even subcontractor laborers. Unequiv-  
ocally state that unsafe practices or conditions are not acceptable. Let everyone  
know that safety is everyone’s responsibility and give everyone permission and the  
protocols for reporting unsafe conditions.  
During preliminary site inspections the risk manager should look for any event  
element or aspect of the event site that might have the potential for injury, scanning SSSA nnsnennsananssessesussssusenansemsntunesnsansnenassusaemen

the environment above, below, from side to side and front to back, and from event  
start to finish. Use a site inspection checklist to make certain all obvious and obscure  
elements are examined \(see Appendix C\: Site inspection checklist\).  
All safety inspection certificates should be checked, including their expiration  
date. For example, all U.S. sailing vessels \(including those one might use for a din-  
ner cruise event\) are inspected annually by the Coast Guard and there will be a cer-  
tificate of inspection posted on board, which ensures that the vessel meets all safety  
regulations and that the crew is able to perform its emergency duties. Ask the venue  
for its current public safety inspection certificates or compliance documentation,  
and discuss its policies and procedures for maintaining a safe and secure facility.  
Walk-through inspections should take place just prior to the event to identify  
safety hazards that were unanticipated or have emerged. Walk-through inspections  
must also be conducted periodically during the event to monitor the status of the  
safeguards that were put in place and to identify any emergent hazardous condi-  
tions. This is particularly important for multi-day events, and a daily safety briefing  
is highly recommended.  
Public health issues  
Public health legislation, enacted in various forms throughout the world, seeks to  
ensure a sanitary environment, the surveillance and control of infectious disease, and  
the promotion of healthy behaviors and personal hygiene. Event organizers and risk  
managers have a duty of care obligation to do everything in their power to identify and  
prevent the accidental or intentional exposure to health hazards at an event. Guidance  
on mass gatherings offered by Australia \(Emergency Management Australia, 1999\),  
Canada \(Hanna, 1994\), the U.K. \(HSE, 1999\), and the U.S. \(FEMA, 2001\) are all in agree-  
ment on the scope of health hazards at events \(see Table 4.4\).  
Many of the public health hazards at events will be identified when evaluating the  
event site, the activities included in the event agenda, and the likely composition and  
behavior of the event audience \(to be addressed further in the operational safeguards

covered in Chapters 10, 11, and 12\). Mitigation of most public health hazards relies on  
the provision of a sanitary environment and hygienic conditions to ensure that expo-  
sure to contaminants is eliminated or limited through proper planning, policies, and  
procedures. It must also be remembered that rain, wind, heat, humidity, and cold can  
affect sanitation and health exposures.  
Waste management  
Waste management consists of planning for the collection and disposal of all the  
solid and liquid waste created at the event. Sanitation and environmental regula-  
tions dictate certain aspects of this because an event site that is littered with rubbish  
may become a health hazard, creating the possibility of accidents, injuries, and ill-  
ness. Sufficient trash receptacles, efficient clearing and cleaning, meticulous grounds  
keeping, and properly scheduled waste removal are necessary to mitigate potential  
hazards \(Silvers, 2004a\).  
The event organizer is considered the waste producer and as such must comply  
with all sanitation or environmental protection codes, including the selection of  
suitable waste contractors and the legal disposal of all waste products \(HSE, 1999\).  
Waste management should be contracted rather than delegated to volunteers to  
ensure it is done properly and the event site is well maintained \(Berlonghi, 1990\).  
Toxic or hazardous waste, including some household and cleaning supplies \(see  
Table 4.5\), and other sewage and sullage must always be disposed of according to  
prescribed and required procedures \(Silvers, 2004a\).  
Improper or haphazard maintenance practices can lead to infestations, fire haz-  
ards, and generally unsanitary conditions. Diligent collection throughout the event  
prevents rubbish build-up and facilitates efficient post-event clean-up. Storage areas  
should be properly positioned, monitored, and maintained to ensure packing mate-  
rials, excess inventory, equipment, and supplies do not create unhealthy or unsafe  
conditions. Access to these areas should be strictly controlled for security reasons  
and as a safety precaution. Rubbish and combustible materials should not be stored  
near tents, structures, or fire exits.  
Particular attention needs to be paid to food service areas and sanitary facilities  
areas. Food waste can putrefy in a very short period of time and rapidly attracts  
insects and vermin. The waste associated with toilet facilities, including feminine

sanitary supplies and disposable diapers/nappies, is sometimes considered a form  
of hazardous waste requiring special handling. In addition, clinical waste, also des-  
ignated hazardous material, may be generated by first aid stations and must be dis-  
posed of accordingly.  
Particularly for outdoor sites, pest control may be important, perhaps requiring  
clearing or cleaning out of infested areas, spraying for insects, and coverings for all  
waste receptacles. The risk manager should determine if vector-borne diseases are  
prevalent or possible and work with public health authorities to control the vector  
\(e.g., insects, birds, dogs, rodents, or vermin\). If domestic animals such as dogs are  
allowed at the event, owner rules must be established for their control and the clean-  
up of their waste.  
A pre-event inspection should be conducted to determine the condition of the  
event site or property, then conditions must be monitored throughout the duration  
of the event. The site should be inspected after the event to make certain it has been  
cleaned and repaired to its original \(or better\) condition to prevent damage sur-  
charges or cleaning fees.  
Sanitation and hygiene  
Cleanliness and hygienic conditions are imperative for many reasons, including health  
and safety from injuries or illness, but also for the comfort and welfare of the event  
audience, participants, and personnel. Depending on the type, scope, activities, and site  
of an event, providing the appropriate sanitation systems and conditions could entail  
special equipment and services, importing power and water, the provision of supplies  
and personnel, and numerous scheduling and other logistical requirements.  
Water is a critical component of health and hygiene. The quantity and quality of  
water supplies must be assessed, particularly for outdoor events and temporary  
event sites, including the potential for water supply sabotage and the location and  
logistics of getting emergency water supplies. Free and freely accessible drinking  
water must be provided at all events. Potable \(drinkable\) water must also be pro-  
vided for cleansing needs \(and hot water is often a requisite for catering operations\),  
and non-potable water may be needed for dust abatement. Ad hoc swimming or  
washing in contaminated water can cause gastrointestinal disease and access should  
be restricted with fencing and/or warning signage if water quality is unsuitable.  
Sanitary facilities \(toilets\) must be in sufficient numbers to accommodate the  
expected number and types of users for the expected duration of the event. They  
must be positioned appropriately to serve the various event populations \(facilities  
for staff and vendors may need to be segregated from the general public popula-  
tion\). They must also be properly monitored and maintained to ensure they are clean  
and well stocked with the necessary supplies \(HSE, 1999\).  
Standards vary according to jurisdiction \(check with the local authorities\), but  
guidance suggests a minimum of two stalls \(toilet plus urinal\) per 100 people should  
be provided for events with less than six hours duration. However, this does not  
take into consideration the flexibility of access timing \(e.g., everyone heading to the  
toilets during intermissions or breaks\) or the activities taking place \(e.g., consump-  
tion of alcohol, coffee, or other fluids\). One must also consider ‘potty parity’ \(gender  
equity\) when evaluating the number of toilet facilities. Studies reveal that, on aver-  
age, it takes five minutes for women to go to the toilet and three minutes for men;  
and women take 55 to 65 percent longer in public toilets than men due to waiting for a  
92 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
stall availability. Therefore more facilities must be provided for women and separate  
facilities for men and women may need to be re-designated depending on the com-  
position of the crowd.  
For undeveloped or under-developed sites, portable sanitary facilities may need  
to be brought to the event site. Handicapped accessible facilities may need to be pro-  
vided and deluxe portable toilet trailers may be used for upscale events. Hand-  
washing facilities should always be provided. Note that these facilities should be  
monitored to ensure they are not being used for illegal activities. Portable toilet units  
must be positioned and anchored properly to prevent accidental or intentional tip-  
ping. Toilet facilities should be well lit, well marked, and separated from food serv-  
ice or storage areas. Access for delivery, maintenance \(pump-out and cleaning\), and  
removal must be incorporated into the site and operational plans.  
Food safety  
Food and water is fundamental to life. The preparation and delivery of food and  
beverage service must be safe, sanitary, and sufficient, and is governed by specific  
governmental regulations and operational requirements. Food service regulations  
vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include health permits, zoning laws,  
specific business and occupational licenses, levels of insurance coverage \(including  
product liability\), employment laws, and other laws and codes pertaining to prepar-  
ing and serving food to the public. .  
From the in-house catering departments of hotels and event facilities to independ-  
ent off-premise caterers to take away providers such as restaurants and grocery  
stores, caterers and catering organizations vary widely in quality, experience, expert-  
ise, and capability. Food and beverage concessions at public festivals, stadiums, and  
arenas may need to be selected from authorized vendors \(those with contracts with  
the facility or municipality\). All caterers and concessionaires should be checked to  
ensure they hold the appropriate and necessary health permits, business licenses, and  
insurance coverage. Sanitary conditions from sufficient potable water and facilities  
for washing foods and equipment to employee hygiene to pest control must be in  
place and impeccable for any catering operation, on-premise or off-premise.  
Food-borne illness, often referred to as food poisoning, is caused by the consump-  
tion of a contaminated food with the common symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, vom-  
iting, abdominal cramps, headache, and/or fever. It is often the result of improper  
sanitation and handling or the incorrect preparation of foods with inherent contam-  
inants \(see Table 4.6\). Foods with inherent contaminants \(e.g., seafood, poultry, and  
Table 4.6 Sources of food contamination

dairy products\) should be identified in the risk assessment for off-premise events or  
events using food concessionaires. These foods require special attention because  
although the food itself is safe when cooked properly, hazardous substances may be  
left on the preparation surfaces that must be cleaned and sanitized properly to pre-  
vent cross-contamination. Gastrointestinal illness questionnaires should be filled  
out by anyone suffering from symptoms because numerous instances of similar ill-  
ness within a short period of time can indicate a contamination problem. The  
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point \(HACCP\) food safety assurance system high-  
lights potential problems in food preparation, transportation, display, storage, and  
service \(see Figure 4.2\). It may be wise to confirm adoption of a food safety manage-  
ment system such as this with any caterer or catering operation under consideration  
for an event in order to identify, monitor, and control contamination risks and haz-  
ards associated with food-borne illness.  
Occupational safety is also a consideration. The catering operations must guard  
against such hazards as burns from cooking and serving equipment, cuts from  
knives or broken glass, slips and trips on spilled liquids or electrical cords, falls, fire,  
and fumes. Those preparing and serving foods and beverages should be properly  
trained in food handler hygiene and food service proprietors must have an incident  
reporting system to identify and report any infectious diseases in the staff.  
Consider this... 4.5  
Hepatitis on the trade show floor  
September 22, 2005\: The Clark County Health District \(CCHD\) in Las Vegas, Nevada, was  
notified that a person serving free ice cream samples at the Global Gaming Expo \(G2E\) 2005,  
held September 13-15 at the Las Vegas Convention Center, was infected with hepatitis A, a  
viral infection of the liver. People who were served ice cream samples by the infected food  
handler may have been at risk for developing the illness. Although there is no treatment for  
hepatitis A, symptoms can be prevented in exposed persons who receive gamma globulin  
within 14 days of their exposure, in this case no later than the 28th of September. The G2E  
organizers immediately provided the CCHD with the names and contact information for  
everyone registered as a conference attendee and the CCHD distributed a public health notice  
via e-mail to all attendees on September 23, 2005 with the name of the specific booth, the dates  
that the infected food handler was working, and the nature of the disease so that any person  
who ate free samples served at the booth could contact their local health department and/or  
physician to determine the need for gamma globulin.  
Occupational health and safety  
The event risk manager is not only concerned with the health and safety of the event  
audience, but also with all those who have come together to create and operate the  
event. All job sites and workplaces should be safe and healthy places for workers and  
others — a legal responsibility for both the employer and the employee. This is some-  
thing the event organizers must consider when planning the event site and operations. 94 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

Occupational health and safety \(OHS\) is regulated in most countries via legisla-  
tion and standards. There are 14 jurisdictions in Canada \(federal, provincial, and ter-  
ritorial\) each having its own OHS legislation based upon Part II of the Canada  
Labour Code. OHS standards in Australia are administered by the National  
Occupational Health and Safety Commission. The European Agency for Safety and  
Health at Work was set up in 1996 in the European Union to collect, analyze, and  
promote OSH-related information. South Africa has the Occupational Health  
and Safety Act of 1993 and the Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 governs OHS  
standards in the U.K. In the U.S., standards are promulgated by the Occupational  
Safety and Health Administration and adopted and enforced by the states.  
What all OHS legislation, standards, and various regulations developed for spe-  
cific industries and activities have in common is the mandate to provide a work  
environment that is safe and employees are protected from hazards that may cause  
injury, damage, or disease. This is not the exclusive responsibility of employers.  
Employees have a duty to share in this responsibility by complying with the policies  
and procedures that are designed to protect health and safety, as well as report  
unsafe and unhealthy conditions to their employers and work together to identify  
eat\: and develop control and precautionary measures to improve workplace  
safety.  
OHS standards extend further than the employer and employee. ‘Event organis-  
ers, concert promoters, licensees, specialist contractors and venue owners all have a  
statutory duty to protect the health and safety of their workers and others who may  
be affected by their work activity’ \(HSE, 1999, p. 187\). In this light, providing a safe  
and healthy work environment encompasses volunteers, participants, and attendees  
as well. Whether mandated by law or not, event organizers and risk managers EEE EES SIS SS SS  
Health and safety 95  
should strive to ensure compliance with the highest standards of workplace safety  
possible. The typical OHS standards address the following OHS issues\:

Electrical safety  
Equipment maintenance  
Equipment training

Occupational hazards  
Everyone, from the event organizer to the suppliers to the volunteers, must be com-  
mitted to a safe working environment and safe work practices and must be active  
participants in the commitment to on-the-job \(OTJ\) safety. Everyone is responsible  
for identifying the health and safety hazards of any work being done, anything  
being produced, processed, used, stored, handled, or transported, as well as any  
equipment or machinery being used.  
As shown in Table 4.7, OTJ hazards are often categorized by type as physical, chemi-  
cal, ergonomic, infectious, or stress. Conducting a risk mapping exercise with employ-  
ees and other stakeholders in order to locate and highlight the places where these  
hazards occur on a map or floor plan of a work or event space will allow the risk man-  
ager to prepare effective risk reduction and control strategies \(Hazards Magazine,  
1997\).  
Time, training, and precautions  
The key components of OT\] safety are sufficient time, training, and precautions. Most  
job site accidents at events occur when people are rushing to complete a job. This is  
when workers forego the appropriate safety precautions in order to get the job done  
as quickly as possible. For example, climbing on things or standing ona chair to reach  
something instead of getting the ladder or appropriate lift device, or using the wrong  
tools for the job at hand are frequent causes of accidents. Adequate time must be allo-  
cated to accomplish the work to be done, particularly during the move-out, which is  
often done late at night and with personnel that are already tired. eee

Bob Estrin, event venue infrastructure consultant with b.e.creative in Orange,  
California, offers this perspective on the causes of event accidents\:  
Event accidents occur at a much greater rate to employees and staff than to attendees. These end up being  
classified as workplace injuries so we tend not think of them as ‘event’ accidents. A large number of unre-  
ported injuries occur during load out. If we want to be totally accurate we should track accidents from the  
time of departure en route to the venue until all staff have retuned to their point of origin. So what causes  
these accidents?  
Time\:  
Rushed travel  
Inadequate load in time  
Not enough set up time  
Rushed take down  
Equipment\:  
e Misuse  
e Incorrect items  
Staffing\:  
@ Training  
e Lack of event information  
e Not supplying correct number of staff  
A more detailed analysis leads to the conclusion that the true underlyin § cause is economic. The cost of doing  
a properly staffed event with adequate venue time is not often factored into the proposals in the event indus-  
try. Profit margins are thin and time is a costly commodity. The true cost of an accident can be extreme. Most  
businesses can’t bear the burdens that can exist beyond what insurance covers LL eS Aertel eens hic etme

Dangerous tent handling practices result in tragedy  
October 2004\: Three workers in Arkansas were electrocuted when the supports in the intact  
tent they lifted over a fence touched power lines. Three other workers handling the tent sur-  
vived. The practice of moving a tent without dismantling it is common in the event rental  
industry, often the result of tight deadlines and last minute changes demanded by clients. The  
high turnover rate of the low-wage workforce typically used by rental companies to install  
tents contributes to the lack of awareness of the possible dangers and safe tent handling pro-  
cedures, but this should be mitigated by proper supervision, including pointing out power  
lines and other hazards prior to moving a tent. The tragedy was repeated nine months later  
\(July 25, 2005\) when four scout leaders were electrocuted and three others injured while pitch-  
ing a dining tent under power lines at the Boy Scout Jamboree in Virginia.

Workers must be provided with the proper tools, equipment, and materials to effi-  
ciently and safely do the work required. Proper training must be provided to all per-  
sonnel operating machinery, vehicles, or other equipment that could be dangerous to  
the worker or others in close proximity. Personal protective equipment \(PPE\) and  
proper clothing is required when handling certain materials and doing certain tasks  
and could include safety chains, rails, or straps, safety boots, hard hats, surgical or  
metal gloves, long-sleeved shirts, goggles, face guards, respiratory masks, back  
braces, harnesses, hearing protection, toe guards, and other gear.  
In addition, proper equipment such as ladders, aerial lifts, forklifts, hand trucks,  
platforms, and scaffolding must be provided when installing, moving, and removing  
décor and production equipment. Numerous worker injuries are the result of incorrect  
manual handling procedures, including lifting, carrying, pushing, or pulling, causing  
back injuries and muscle strains. These often lead to muscular-skeletal disorders,  
which can cause chronic debilitating pain. These are the cause of many workers’ com-  
pensation claims, which can be very costly as insurance rates rise. Many injuries are  
due to fall hazards, including falling off something, something falling on someone, or  
falling with a collapsing structure or piece of equipment. These injuries, and some-  
times deaths, occur primarily during installation and/or construction, but fall hazards  
associated with the site terrain must also be considered. Guidance suggests that fall  
protection should be provided when the work surface \(e.g., stage\) or worker is six feet  
\(1.8 meters\) or more above the ground.  
The work environment  
The health and safety of work environments has been studied extensively by indus-  
trial hygienists. Unlike most workplaces, however, events are temporary in nature  
and often occur in unusual or unfamiliar settings or venues that are not built with  
the theatrical capabilities so often employed for event productions. Typically the  
workers, paid and volunteer, do not work regularly in a particular venue doing the  
same thing day after day. Add to this the pressure to get the event set up in time for  
‘the show to go on’ and the fact that the ‘show’ is rarely repeated, the assurance that EEE  
98 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
the work environment is safe and healthy can be problematic. Exposure to haz-  
ardous substances, excessive heat or cold, extreme noise levels, and unsatisfactory  
illumination so often endured by event personnel must be controlled.  
Exposure to hazardous substances or conditions may be the result of using unsuit-  
able or mishandling equipment, inadequate ventilation, improper storage practices, or  
not using the appropriate protective equipment and clothing. Indoor use of diesel or  
propane powered equipment \(e.g., vehicles or vehicle mounted platforms, cooking  
or grilling devices, etc.\) can cause significant carbon monoxide exposure. Exposure  
to air-borne chemicals, dust, or other toxic emissions can occur when using aerosol  
sprays, solvents, paints, certain adhesives, and atmospheric special effects \(e.g., fog and  
haze effects, artificial snow, and pyrotechnic smoke\).  
High noise levels can cause health hazards ranging from headaches to permanent  
hearing loss. Noise protection must be provided for workers exposed to occupational  
noise levels of more than 85 decibels \(dBA\), which would encompass many event  
activities and event personnel, particularly for concert or sports events \(typically hav-  
ing levels of 120 dBA and higher\). Poor lighting can cause eye strain and obscure slip  
or trip hazards. Make certain sufficient illumination is provided throughout the dura-  
tion of the job from set up through move-out. Good job site housekeeping is also  
important. Slip and trip hazards are often the result of improperly placed equipment,  
poorly stored materials, uneven surfaces, spilled liquids, and debris.  
Duty to warn  
All workers have the right to know the hazards associated with the use of various  
materials or equipment and conditions in the workplace. Material safety data sheets  
\(MSDS\) should be procured for all hazardous materials \(e.g., chemicals\) and must be  
made accessible to workers using these materials. MSDS include information about  
hazardous or toxic ingredients, physical or chemical characteristics, fire and explo-  
sion data, health hazard data, special protection information, special precautions,  
reactivity data, spill or leak procedures, and emergency procedures \(McSwane, Rue,  
and Linton, 2003\).  
Hazard warning, prohibition, fire safety /equipment, and other mandatory, direc-  
tional, and informational signs are required on job sites. Safety and warning signs  
should be placed at all hazardous locations \(e.g., ‘Caution\: Wet Floor’ signs\) and on  
all hazardous equipment or supplies. At times inspectors have required warning  
signage in places that are not accessed or accessible during an event, such as back-  
stage electrical installations, but the signs must be posted regardless. Warning tags  
or labels, which will be on original containers or packaging, should be placed on all  
hazardous materials and must be replicated if the contents are transferred to and  
stored in another container so that in the event of an accident, illness, or spill, emer-  
gency responders will know what they are dealing with \(Rossol, 2000\)  
Proactive safety policies  
Many OHS standards suggest or require companies with a certain number of  
employees create a safety officer position or a safety committee that has oversight  
responsibilities to ensure health and safety hazards are identified and addressed  
according to the standards. Best practice guidance suggests that event organizations  
do the same by establishing policies and procedures that limit undesirable behavior LLL TTS nmin  
Health and safety 99  
and conditions. Although compliance with OHS standards may or may not be a legal  
responsibility toward event volunteers, it is certainly a moral obligation. The devel-  
opment and implementation of employee and volunteer standards of conduct that  
address areas of activity that pose potential problems or hazards will help prevent  
accidents and injuries and create a culture of safety awareness. Train all employees  
and volunteers about safety issues in general and their specific duties in particular.  
Make certain they have adequate experience before undertaking hazardous opera-  
tions. Periodically update information and retrain them as necessary \(Reiss, 2001\).  
Many event professionals feel that it is up to the event manager or event risk man-  
ager to set the standards for safety on the event job site by holding a safety meeting  
with the suppliers and their workers prior to the installation of an event. This meet-  
ing should instill in workers \(paid or volunteer\) the commitment to a safe work  
environment and empower them to participate in and enforce that commitment.  
This includes workers advising supervisors when hazards are identified, including  
co-workers working improperly. The event organizer or risk manager should also  
confirm that all independent contractors have appropriate safety programs in place,  
paying particular attention to any bids that are significantly lower than others,  
which might indicate substandard equipment or untrained personnel are being used  
\(Silvers, 2004a\).  
# Summary  
Event organizers have a legal, ethical, and financial responsibility to make certain  
that the event and event operations are at the highest standards of safety possible.  
Neglecting these public health and safety issues indicates an indifference to the  
probable consequences that should have been recognized by a professional and  
exposes the organizer and/or organization to liability for any harm that occurs.  
Existing statutes and codes legislated by municipalities and jurisdictions respon-  
sible for their citizenry cover many of these issues, and are based on standards estab-  
lished by national and international organizations that have studied accidents,  
injuries, emergencies, and disasters to determine the preventable causes. The event  
risk manager works with representatives of the applicable regulatory agencies to  
ensure a safe and healthy event, event site, and job site.  
Sanitary conditions are critical to the protection of the public health. Requirements  
are based on the health codes of a jurisdiction as well as the cultural and cosmetic  
standards of the event type, scope, and location. The monitoring of sanitary condi-  
tions is exponentially more important as the duration of an event expands and food  
service is provided. Special attention must be paid to outdoor and undeveloped  
event sites.  
The health and safety of every audience member, provider, participant, and paid  
or volunteer worker is the primary responsibility of the event risk manager. Appro-  
priate training must be delivered, precautionary measures to control hazards must  
be devised, and abiding by these measures must be enforced for everyone’s safety.  
Although some may argue that compliance with occupational safety and health reg-  
ulations is too burdensome for volunteer-driven events and would add too much  
expense to the production budget for all events, protecting the health and welfare of  
these people will help protect the event’s assets \(and its existence\) by reducing the  
liabilities that subject the event to financial risk. a EEE

You have been retained as a risk consultant by the XYZ Fun Fest, a nine-day family-  
oriented event that has an attendance of more than 50 000. One of your tasks is to  
develop criteria and policies for selecting food and beverage concessionaires at their  
annual outdoor festival that will avoid or mitigate food and beverage service and  
safety hazards. These criteria should focus on ‘proofs’ that their practices are such  
that health and safety hazards will be minimized, and may include food-borne ill-  
ness, scope of menu items and ingredients, occupational safety hazards, alcohol  
service, and compliance issues.  
Write a 10-point food and beverage concessionaire policy that the festival can use  
when soliciting and contracting concessionaires \(e.g., Concessionaires shall provide  
documentation that they follow the HACCP food safety system\), and justify your  
recommendations citing a minimum of three reference resources. Health and safety 101

# Introduction  
There are probably as many ways to incur losses as there are ways to acquire gains  
\(see Table 5.1\). Losses can be large or small; accidental, intentional, or due to negli-  
gence; controllable or beyond one’s control; due to internal and external sources; or  
due to conditions or incidents \(e.g., natural, man-made, technological, or political\).  
For every item on the strategic or operational planning list and for every facet of the  
event project, there are potential losses to be considered that could jeopardize the  
resources and reputation of the event organization.  
Loss prevention  
Loss prevention means different things to different industries. In the retail industry,  
it focuses on stopping or reducing loss from shoplifting and employee theft; in the nn nnn LESSEE SI Ea

construction industry it focuses on safety to reduce workers’ compensation liability;  
in knowledge industries it focuses on information asset protection. Fischer and  
Green \(1998\) contend that external theft accounts for only half the loss that internal  
theft does, suggesting that the event organization needs to look inward as well as  
outward when assessing vulnerabilities. Whether using bar codes to track raw mate-  
rials in the prop shop or inventory in the souvenir sales booth, restricting access to  
office supplies or client lists, or checking for falsified purchase orders to kickbacks  
from suppliers, loss prevention begins within.  
Some think loss prevention is synonymous with protection services \(security\),  
while others see it as all measures used to reduce the frequency of losses. Loss pre-  
vention encompasses these perspectives and, in fact, all the topics covered in this  
book. It employs numerous strategies \(see Table 5.2\) to address or treat the identified  
risks in order to protect financial, physical, environmental, and human assets from  
loss and destruction, and to control the negative impact should it occur.  
Loss prevention, as illustrated in Figure 5.1, encompasses five areas of activity that  
should be applied to the event purpose, product, processes, place, people, and prac-  
tices. It may also be seen as a progressive strategy that, first, puts in place all the pre-  
ventative countermeasures possible, which are identified in the risk response plan.  
These must then be monitored in order to detect if the countermeasure has been com-  
promised or if a hazard or vulnerability has been exposed. Once an exposure has  
occurred, its impact must be controlled and overcome, if possible, through contingency Loss prevention and security 105

planning. And, finally, if a loss occurs, the organization needs to be able to recover from  
its impact.  
To facilitate proper detection, Berlonghi \(1996\) suggests that safety patrol teams be  
developed with the lone responsibility of circulating through the event looking for  
safety hazards and unsafe activity and reporting such to the proper supervisory or  
security personnel or authorities and assisting response personnel as requested.  
Control measures, as noted in Chapter 2, are those physical, behavioral, and proce-  
dural actions, devices, strategies, and systems employed to prevent or reduce loss  
\(Jeynes, 2002\) and there should be control measures specified for each identified risk  
\(see Figure 5.2\). According to Jeynes \(p. 62\), ‘There are as many ways to control or  
reduce the impact of a hazard as there are types of hazard.’ It is also important to  
fully understand the critical functions of the event operations to ensure these are  
protected with effective control measures and timely contingency plans. 106 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Contingency and continuity  
# planning  
Contingency plans are the strategies and detailed plans to deal with and recover  
from possible and unanticipated problems or risks should they materialize. They  
must be developed to address those risks that will be retained \(often referred to as  
Plan B\). Conducting a gap analysis should uncover any gaps or vulnerabilities in the  
event's planning, site, or operations. The gap analysis should examine the following.  
e What is critical?  
e What is vulnerable?  
e What is uncertain?  
¢ What is missing?  
e What else? What else? What else?  
For every vulnerability or uncertainty identified, alternative ways to overcome them  
must be carefully considered \(see Figure 5.3\). This may include alternative, redun-  
dant, or additional dates, sites, activities, equipment, and/or personnel should  
something go wrong, such as weather problems, equipment problems, or procure-  
ment problems. There will be different costs, logistical impacts, and triggers to be  
established with each contingency plan considered. It is also important to consider  
Internal  
communications

the ‘domino effect’ \(Berlonghi, 1990\) wherein one failure or incident prompts or  
causes subsequent failures or risky conditions, which trigger further failures, which  
produce further breakdowns, and so on. Think about and fully integrate how a sin-  
gle vulnerability and the facets of its contingency plan affect other facets of the over-  
all event plan.  
If inclement weather could be a problem for an outdoor event, a tent might be  
secured or a substitute indoor space might be reserved. If power is critically important  
to the event, a back-up portable generator would be considered. If already using a  
portable generator for the event power, perhaps a second generator as redundant  
equipment will be ordered. One of the more noted speakers at a conference might be  
asked to move his or her presentation to the keynote slot if the keynote speaker is a no-  
show. Berlonghi \(1996\) advises securing commitments from personnel and suppliers  
to be prepared to provide goods and services if called upon in an emergency only if  
needed, which can reduce the costs associated with a contingency plan. It is also best  
practice to confirm and collect contingency plans from each of your suppliers so that  
these may be integrated into your overall contingency planning \(ICCA/COPE, 2005\).  
Consider this... 5.1  
Hurricane causes cruise conference havoc  
August 1996\: An association had selected a five-day cruise as the venue for its annual profes-  
sional development conference. Months and months of hard work lining up and plotting out  
an extensive and compact schedule of educational sessions that left the time in the ports of call  
free had to be tossed out the port hole when Hurricane Dolly approached the Caribbean on the  
first night out. Cruise ships have the option to simply sail around such things as hurricanes  
and their contract with you \(your ticket\) says that they intend to go to these ports, but are free  
to change the itinerary. And change it they did, overnight. The planner had to completely  
rearrange and reschedule the conference agenda to coordinate with the ship’s new itinerary.  
Instead of 14 hours of ‘at sea’ time for the conference sessions, there was now only nine and a  
half hours. In addition, not only was the conference planner scrambling to rearrange every-  
thing; the ship was scrambling with all their programming for the thousand other passengers  
as well. The planner had to coordinate and confirm all conference plans using the various pub-  
lic lounges with the ship’s plans for those lounges. In the end, only two concurrent session  
options were canceled, one session was changed from a general session to a concurrent session  
as one of the speakers canceled because he was due to have boarded in Cozumel \(no longer  
on the itinerary\), and two general sessions were shortened.  
Once the contingency plan options have been identified, the deadlines and proto-  
cols for implementing the plan must be determined, including who will do what,  
when, and where. These deadlines must then be incorporated into the time line and  
other operational plans. Certain contingency responses can be made at any time dur-  
ing the event time line, but some decisions must be made by a certain time prior to  
the event, such as ordering and installing a tent or portable generator. It is also advis-  
able to test your ability to activate back up and contingency plans with a trial run  
\(ICCA/COPE, 2005\). Fe 108 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
nmmnnnenmmnesnemmeeeenenee sees a sa saasaaaaaaaaaaaaasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal  
Communications are an important aspect of contingency planning because the deci-  
sion to activate a contingency plan must be conveyed to those who will be involved in  
and impacted by its implementation. Although most contingency plans are put in  
place to assure a seamless operation \(an invisible work around\) should something go  
wrong, it may be necessary to impart certain information to other internal and exter-  
nal constituents should it become necessary to implement the contingency plan. This  
may include informing the client, staff, performers and participants, suppliers, author-  
ities, attendees, and perhaps the neighboring residents or general public.  
Contingency planning must incorporate the event needs with the event budget.  
According to Silvers \(2004a, p. 57\), ‘You must verify and validate your contingency  
plans with the host organization or your client so that the resources required to  
implement a risk response or contingency plan are fully funded and supported.’  
Sometimes the client or host may decide not to invest in these safeguards, but the  
event risk manager is responsible for making the client aware of them. If the client  
does not wish to invest in them \(their cost-benefit attitude may be different than  
yours\), other recovery strategies must be devised or the client’s written agreement  
that nothing is to be done \(and that the client accepts the consequences\) must be  
secured.  
Continuity planning addresses how the event or event organization will recover  
from an incident or disaster. The objective of continuity planning is to be prepared and  
able to work around and continue normal operations with minimal or no interruption.  
This plan should focus on salvaging, reconstructing, and/or replacing damaged or  
missing equipment, hardware or software, records, workforce capacity, environmen-  
tal conditions, venue capability, or other vital support in order to resume business  
\(FEMA, 2004\). Continuity plans, like contingency plans, need to consider the replace-  
ment time and costs for key personnel, equipment, and supplies \(Broder, 2000\), and  
they must be devised before an incident occurs or they will be at best expensive and at  
worst ineffective \(Smith and Merritt, 2002\).  
Risk financing and insurance  
Risk financing and risk management funding are not the same thing \(AIRMIC,  
ALARM, and IRM, 2002\). Risk financing is the allocation of funding for the financial  
consequences of risk exposure, either through the retention of the risk \(self-insured\) or  
the transfer of risk through the purchase of the proper insurance coverage for the  
event and event organization. Risk management funding is the allocation of sufficient  
resources to conduct effective risk management processes and procedures and imple-  
ment risk treatment activities. Sufficient financial resources must be allocated for both.  
When determining whether to retain risk and pay for it through the event organi-  
zation’s own financial resources or transfer the risk through the purchase of insur-  
ance coverage, NFPA 1250 \(2000\) offers the following guidance.  
¢ Low severity/low frequency\: Retain; affordable risk.  
e Low severity/high frequency\: Retain; predictable costs.  
¢ High severity/low frequency\: Transfer; costs too high.  
e High severity/high frequency\: Avoid; do not be in that business \(transfer only if can-  
not avoid, but insurance likely to be costly\) eee

Lighting balloon sails away  
Giant lighting balloons were used to add illumination to a large outdoor company party.  
These patented helium-filled glowing globes are made from rip stop nylon with a lighting fil-  
ament suspended inside and anchored to the ground by their power cord. Even though the  
weather was wonderfully calm the night of the party, late in the evening a wind gust came up  
and before the event staff could get all the balloons brought down to earth, one snapped loose  
from its power cord and sailed off over the desert in the dark. There was no way to track its  
trajectory to recover it, leaving the event company that leased it liable for replacement costs.  
Luckily, the event company had insurance coverage for such a loss; otherwise the costs could  
have wiped out the entire profits for the event project.  
Insurance management  
Insurance coverage is purchased to pay for losses that the event organization cannot  
afford. These losses may include the costs of litigation or event cancellation, the  
replacement costs due to loss or damage of property, the loss of key personnel, and  
the financial exposure and legal settlements that may be awarded due to negligence,  
injury, or death. Insurance management deals with ascertaining liability exposures  
and contractual insurance coverage requirements, sourcing suitable providers, and  
acquiring the proper insurance policies in order to maintain suitable loss prevention  
coverage and risk financing for the event project.  
Within the menu of risk responses, insurance is the transference of financial liabil-  
ity from one entity to another; in this case the insurance carrier or underwriter. Some  
think that risk management is simply the purchasing of enough insurance to cover  
potential losses \(perhaps a valid but assuredly expensive attitude\). The insurance  
industry, however, may be reluctant to offer coverage to the meetings and events  
marketplace because it does not thoroughly understand what the exposures are.  
Even with those underwriters that do understand the exposures, insurance coverage  
may not be available for every liability or risk. And, even if it were, it would likely  
be too expensive in the context of most events. The hosting organization must eval-  
uate the event exposures and secure the appropriate insurance coverage based on  
what is legally required and fiscally prudent.  
Use a professional broker/agent  
This discussion should not be construed as advice on what insurance coverage you  
should purchase, but instead, a guideline for what should be discussed with compe-  
tent insurance consultants. There are hundreds of insurance products that might be  
applicable to events and event organizations \(see Table 5.3\). Event risk managers  
and event organizations must make decisions about what insurance coverage to  
purchase based on the particular type, purpose, scope, program of activities, com-  
ponents, audience, legal obligations, marketing, sponsors, merchandising, organiza-  
tional structure, personnel, vendors, and location of the event.  
Every event is different and every event organization is different. For example, a  
convention might be most concerned with event cancellation and host liquor liability nnn

insurance; an independent event organizer would likely purchase errors and omis-  
sions insurance; a historical battle re-enactment event would want its insurance to  
cover the use of archery, black powder, cavalry, or cannons; an outdoor festival might  
seek weather insurance; a charity hole-in-one contest might purchase a prize indem-  
nification policy; an incentive travel program may consider travel delay protection;  
and staging a concert event on a sports field may require turf insurance. However, all  
public events need some form of commercial general liability coverage \(also known  
as public liability or spectator insurance\).  
Note that these are products. You must be a savvy consumer and buy only what  
you need. Insurance salespeople have a knack for outlining every possible bad thing  
that could happen — adverse weather conditions disrupting air transport or affecting  
outdoor activities; the venue is damaged by fire or storm; no-show speakers or enter-  
tainers due to illness or delays; strikes or natural disasters causing disruption to  
scheduled services; terrorism dissuading people from traveling; outbreaks of infec-  
tious diseases leading to quarantine or restricted access; unforeseen political events  
such as coups or disputes with other countries causing border closure; and death of  
heads of state causing periods of official mourning \(www.event-assured.com\). Any of  
these things \(and many more\) can and have happened, but you must be realistic  
about what insurance coverage is mandated, essential, and sensible based on your  
event or event organization.  
The event risk manager works with a qualified insurance agent or broker to evalu-  
ate the event liabilities by reviewing the event operations and its risk assessment.  
Determine the contractually required coverage, including the requirements from the  
venue, client, and perhaps certain suppliers. Determine the necessary and pre-existing  
coverage. Examine the pre-existing coverage to determine any gaps or exclusions.  
Finally, determine if the limits of coverage are sufficient. Note that independent agents  
and brokers represent a variety of insurance carriers; exclusive agents work for a  
single underwriter. ene  
Loss prevention and security 111  
Full, candid, and continuous explanations of what operations and activities are  
included in an event and conducted by the event organization, as well as the geo-  
graphical extent of those operations and activities, are critical because this will not  
only assist with identifying and purchasing the proper types and amounts of cover-  
age, it is a contractual issue. An insurance policy is a contract, and as such, the infor-  
mation provided by the insured becomes the legal basis for payment or rejection of  
a Claim. In addition, the purchaser \(the insured\) has a continuing duty of disclosure  
to the seller \(the insurer\) to communicate any changes in assets, new or unusual  
activities, or risk exposures that will be undertaken at an event.  
Analyze the insurance coverage you are purchasing to ensure the coverage meets  
your expectations. For example, liability insurance covers legal defense costs as well  
as damages awarded up to the limits of the insurance policy, after which you must  
pay the remaining costs \(Sorin, 2003\). You must understand the policy limitations  
and exclusions, the perils \(causes of loss\) covered and how those perils are defined,  
the locations and property covered, the persons covered, the time periods covered,  
the deductibles, and your duties in the event of a loss \(Berlonghi, 1990\). Foster \(2002\)  
advises that a rider should be purchased for any exclusions in a liability policy as  
needed, with particular attention paid to contractual liability associated with indem-  
nification and hold harmless clauses, and also advises that general liability and pro-  
fessional liability coverage should be procured from the same carrier to prevent  
separate carriers assigning a loss to the other. Considering the increase in frivolous  
lawsuits, the soaring costs of legal representation, and the high damages awarded  
by juries, Sorin \(2003\) recommends a minimum of five million dollars in general lia-  
bility coverage for event companies.

Traveling product demonstrations  
Traveling exhibitions are a common event for companies wishing to demonstrate their products  
to a variety of people. The live exhibition is presented as entertainment and is often more effec-  
tive in promoting the product than television or radio advertising. At one of the periodic risk  
management meetings for a traveling product demonstration for a major insurance company  
one of the risks identified was people slipping on purpose and suing the company. This is a form  
of fraud. It was regarded as a ‘possible’ to ‘high’ risk because insurance companies are often pre-  
disposed to settling such claims and may have been seen as an easy target for insurance fraud.  
The exhibition with performance stages traveled around the country and was very popular,  
attracting thousands of people every day. However, in this case, the risk was not picked up at the  
beginning of the tour but the management of the event was ‘risk aware’ and soon realized their  
exposure.

Cost-saving options should be explored with the insurance broker, such as higher  
deductibles, riders, umbrella policies, extensions to existing coverage, and being listed  
as additionally insured or co-insured on client and supplier policies. Additionally  
insured requirements may be reciprocal with venues and other vendors, which must 112 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

be confirmed with and arranged by your insurance company. This may entail a fee or  
increased premium, which should be passed along to the requestor if possible. Also  
require the insurance company of those that have listed your organization as addi-  
tionally or co-insured on their policies to provide you with a notice of any policy can-  
cellations, non-renewals, or changes in coverage \(Connell, 2002; Krug, 2000\).  
The event risk manager should also collect certificates of insurance from all sup-  
pliers and subcontractors, and must confirm the validity of those documents as well  
as the viability of those underwriters with your own insurance broker. This certifi-  
cate is issued by the insured’s insurance company or agent and specifies the types  
and liability limits of coverage carried by the insured and its expiration dates. This  
proof of insurance coverage limits your liability exposure and ensures that sufficient  
financial resources are available to support indemnification in case of a loss.  
# Security  
According to Broder \(2000\) security is the application of protection techniques to  
minimize loss opportunity. The role of security is to protect the harmony of the event  
and the assets of the event organization using a variety of tactics \(see Figure 5.4\).  
Security management covers the sourcing, selection, and deployment of the person-  
nel and equipment to be used to provide protective services and support for the  
event project, and the implementation and supervision of the appropriate command  
and control systems to ensure its efficacy.  
Security plans, personnel, equipment, and procedures are an integral part of risk  
management. They are put in place to protect people, property, image, reputations,  
and event assets from damage, harm, injury, loss, or worse \(see Table 5.4\). Security per-  
sonnel may also provide important safety and welfare assistance and fill important  
emergency response functions. Security is required at virtually all events to protect eee

Security planning  
The security plan is only one facet of a risk management plan, specifying methods  
and devices to be used to provide the protection requirements pertinent to a partic-  
ular event or organization. It is widely recommended that a security vulnerability  
assessment \(SVA\) be conducted to determine the weaknesses that could be exploited  
and the appropriate countermeasures and the defensive systems that will mitigate  
those exposures. The National Fire Protection Association’s guidance on premises  
security practices \(NFPA 730\) recommends this methodical and systematic process  
to ensure that assets, physical features, policies, operations, obligations, internal  
activities, and external environments are thoroughly examined and analyzed from a  
protective perspective. The threat assessment in particular classifies critical assets,  
identifies potential targets, and investigates potential adversaries to determine what  
is known about them and their tactics \(NFPA, 2005\).  
Examine the event plans and survey the event site to determine what areas, activ-  
ities, items, or individuals are secure, secure only at certain times, or vulnerable \(see  
Table 5.5\). Assess the security infrastructure of the event location, including the  
crime prevention plans of the city, security plans of the venue, and emergency and  
evacuation plans for both \(Tassiopoulos, 2005\). Identify past or potential problems  
that must be addressed. Define what can and will be done, and what improvements  
will be necessary to provide the level of security required. Specify when and by  
whom these actions or improvements will be accomplished.  
The security plan should address general, high-risk, and other specific security  
needs pertinent to your event and event site \(IAEM, 2004\) and specify your security-  
related measures and procedures, yet the plan must be flexible enough to respond to  
changes and unexpected events \(NFPA, 2005\). It should address the following ele-  
ments \(Berlonghi, 1990; NFPA, 2005\)\:  
¢ Risk factors\: critical assets, inherent and historical risks, and dangerous situations,  
conditions, controversies, or rivalries.  
e Access control systems\: procedural, physical, mechanical, and electronic barriers.  
e Security personnel\: sources, procedures, command structure, deployment, and  
schedules.  
¢ Site maps\: site plan, restricted areas, assembly points, interior and exterior routes  
\(access and escape\), and surrounding vicinity as appropriate \(local, district,  
regional, national, air fields, harbors, border crossings\). esac eet A A EAE

Each type of event \(and each time an event is held\) presents its own unique vulner-  
abilities. A convention, for example, might have different high-profile guests or pre-  
senters each time it is held that require specific procedures, levels of protection, and  
personnel ranging from confidential arrival and departure facilities and personal  
bodyguards to canine bomb detection sweeps and the vetting of all event personnel.  
If the convention includes a trade show, there may be hundreds of exhibitors dis-  
playing expensive products or proprietary equipment that must be protected from  
theft \(actual property or industrial secrets\). If the convention might attract demon-  
strations or confrontations due to its controversial nature or presenters, one must  
remember that, in the U.S., people have freedom of speech and freedom of assembly  
rights — as long as they don’t block entrances or exits, prevent persons from entering  
or leaving any premises, use physical force on any person, throw any type of matter,  
use offensive language likely to promote violence, or commit any criminal act  
\(Beene, 1992\) — and plans must be made to accommodate yet control them.  
In general, the cost of security measures should not exceed the monetary value of  
the assets or areas to be protected \(NFPA, 2005\) but in terms of protecting human  
safety and welfare, which should be your Number One priority, there is no established  
‘value’ for a human life that would justify or ratify a cost/benefit analysis. However,  
no organization has unlimited resources to devote to security measures. One must  
make these decisions based on the realistic assessment of the vulnerabilities specific to Loss prevention and security 115  
the event, the available resources of the event organization, and the capabilities of the  
available protective measures. For example, the 2002 Winter Olympic Games had a  
security budget of \$350 million and the security workers out-numbered the athletes by  
four to one at the Opening Ceremonies, which was appropriate for an event of that  
size and status at that time in that location. A statistical understanding of prior occur-  
rences at the particular location or type of event production will help evaluate invest-  
ment options, and the risk manager should collect this information from law  
enforcement officials, industry resources, and the event's historical records.  
It is also important to balance the security measures from a marketing standpoint  
and a liability perspective. One must look at the impact security measures will have  
on the event experience. Will they cause undue inconvenience for the attendee or  
give the event a militaristic atmosphere? These objections can often be overcome  
with careful planning, integrating the security measures into the very design of the  
event and communicating their importance to the audience in the context of provid-  
ing a safe and secure environment. Investing in and implementing security meas-  
ures will also need to be considered as if one were defending one’s decisions in a  
courtroom, which subjects the defendant to the 20\:20 hindsight definitions of what a  
‘reasonable person’ would have done. The courts \(and juries\) will look at the fore-  
seeability of the risk, its magnitude, and the severity of harm caused measured  
against the expense, practical inconvenience or difficulty, and usefulness of the secu-  
rity measures not employed to determine the reasonableness of your decisions and  
whether or not negligence occurred \(Risk and Reliability Associates, 2003\). When  
choosing not to employ certain security measures you must weigh the significance  
of the risk and the effort and resources needed to reduce it, and be prepared to  
defend your choices.  
Personnel  
The term ‘security’ encompasses the protection of property as well as the personnel  
used to maintain a safe and secure event environment. Depending on the type and  
scope of the event, you might use volunteer event stewards, in-house or venue-  
supplied guards, private security company personnel, and/or uniformed police. In  
some cases peer or volunteer personnel in event staff shirts may be more acceptable  
to or appropriate for an audience than uniformed security guards or law enforce-  
ment personnel. In other contexts, the presence of highly visible security may pro-  
vide a feeling of safety and prevent the outbreak of violence or vandalism. In all  
cases security personnel should be trained observers and enforcers.  
° Contracted\: An outside company or private firm that supplies uniformed security  
personnel. The company may require a Private Patrol Operator’s \(PPO\) license to  
conduct business and supply security guards \(IAEM, 2004\) and security guards  
may need to be licensed as well \(Van der Wagen and Carlos, 2005\). Some guards  
may be authorized to carry weapons.  
° Law enforcement\: Officials whose primary responsibility is to maintain law and  
order and protect the public safety — not the event’s business interests \(Somerson,  
2003\). Officers may be restricted to outside a venue unless there is a public distur-  
bance. Off-duty police might be used but they will likely be required to respond to  
outside emergencies if needed. They may be uniformed or undercover \(plain-  
clothes\), should be used for ejections and arrests whenever possible, and should  
be the only personnel authorized to carry firearms at an event. seta

¢ Peer\: Trained security personnel of the same general age and appearance as the  
audience. They are typically dressed in T-shirts or event-specific logo clothing and  
are often supplemented with and supported by uniformed security guards  
and/or law enforcement.  
¢ Personal\: Bodyguards or special security forces that provide personal protection  
for individuals. The level of protection is based on threat vulnerability. Their  
scope of authority and actions are often non-negotiable.  
¢ Proprietary\: Employed or subcontracted in-house security personnel provided by a  
venue or company employees of the client charged with protection responsibili-  
ties. Their scope of authority and actions may be negotiable, and they may be sup-  
plemented with other types of security personnel.  
¢ Volunteer\: Voluntary personnel charged with observation duties and directing peo-  
ple to the appropriate or authorized areas. They should not be required to perform  
any dangerous or confrontational functions. This type of security may include the  
active or passive presence of psychologically persuasive persons such as ministers  
and mothers known as ‘God Squads’ \(Tarlow, 2002\).  
The need for personnel is based on the need for response \(NFPA, 2005\). Event organi-  
zations should always use a detailed request for proposal \(REP\) outlining specific  
needs when outsourcing a security force \(see Appendix D\: Security plan worksheet\),  
and then thoroughly assess the policies and practices of the firms under consideration,  
particularly their pre-employment screening, drug testing, and training programs  
\(NFPA, 2005\). This is both a sound procurement practice and the performance of the  
due diligence to prevent negligent hiring liability. Assessment criteria must be estab-  
lished in order to evaluate potential providers \(Berlonghi, 1996; Fischer and Green,  
1998\). Factors that should be considered when selecting a contracted security firm are  
shown in Table 5.6. The criteria that should be considered in the performance evalua-  
tion are shown in Table 5.7. ——— ene ener

Security personnel should always be fully briefed on the event site and expectations,  
including the risk factors and vulnerabilities, procedural requirements, response  
duties, and personal demeanor. The attitude of security personnel can affect a situation  
positively \(pacification\) or negatively \(escalation\) \(NFPA, 2005\). They must not use  
excessive or unreasonable force nor abuse their limits of authority. Whether security  
personnel are used to conduct searches for controlled substances prior to admission to  
an event or they are used to assist with medical or emergency evacuations, they are part  
of the event team and part of the event experience. They should be employed and  
deployed in a manner that befits the goals, objectives, and purpose of the event, and  
they should provide comfort rather than confrontation \(Silvers, 2004a\). However,  
Rogers \(2004\) advises that all event staff should be trained in ‘aggressive hospitality,’  
the observation and polite confrontation of suspicious behavior, which allows them to  
assist the lost or confused individual and warn those with criminal objectives that their  
presence has been noted, as well as staff awareness of suspicious packages or activity.  
# Equipment  
The security plan and personnel may employ a variety of equipment and technology  
to support security operations and enhance their effectiveness \(see Table 5.8\).  
Technological forms of security, such as closed circuit TV cameras and other surveil-  
lance equipment, allow specific areas or activities in the event to be monitored con-  
stantly by fewer personnel. Security personnel assigned to control items or objects  
prohibited within the event area may use passive and active search methods requir-  
ing special equipment. eee eh  
118 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Consider this... 5.4  
Mag and Bag  
At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, all people entering a venue were required  
to pass through the ‘Mag and Bag’ security inspection. This included all spectators, volun-  
teers, contractors, athletes, officials, and dignitaries. They were required to walk through mag-  
netometers \(metal detectors\) and submit their bags and any containers to a physical search to  
prevent prohibited items from being carried into the venue. All spectator tickets included this  
requirement in its instructions and recorded announcements reinforced the procedure as peo-  
ple approached venue entrances.  
‘Low-tech’ equipment may also be employed, including simple flashlights for  
investigating under grandstands or stages, and the humble whistle to gain attention.  
If a threat is sufficient \(a bomb, illegal drugs, or other dangerous vulnerability\),  
canine sweeps, patrols, or package inspection may be in order. Special equipment  
may also be necessary to allow security personnel to effectively communicate with  
supervisors and event organizers, as well as move to and through the event site to  
respond to incidents. In addition, an important part of the security plan is the docu-  
mentation of incidents and conditions, which may become evidence in lawsuits  
and/or evaluations, and security personnel should always have the materials  
needed to provide this documentation \(e.g., clipboards, cameras, tape recorders\).  
Two of the most effective preventative security devices are access credentials and  
proper lighting. Access credentials \(to be discussed further in Chapter 12\) should be  
a primary precaution employed at any event, and may be as simple as a badge or as  
sophisticated as an electronic key card. Badges may be color-coded by area or date  
authorization, and colors should be changed daily depending on the duration of the  
event, including set-up and tear-down, and security personnel must be trained to  
recognize the credentialing system. All event and subcontracted vendor personnel  
should be required to wear identification badges to prevent thefts, tampering, and  
other criminal activity. Security lighting should illuminate all event activities, areas,  
perimeters, and sensitive locations or equipment to discourage or deter intruders or  
criminal acts by making detection certain \(NFPA, 2005\).  
# Deployment  
Deploying the appropriate security measures and personnel depends on the identi-  
fication of vulnerabilities — those areas, items, and people that require protection \(see  
Table 5.9\). The number and types of security personnel and equipment will be dic-  
tated by the identified risks to persons and property, and the requirements and capa-  
bilities of the venue or event site. Deployment includes the schedules and areas,  
posts, or positions where security personnel are assigned, and encompasses the  
duties the various personnel must perform. Proper deployment should prevent  
duplication of effort as well as lack of effort \(leaving things undone or ignored\).  
Security personnel should be deployed and equipment positioned in a manner that  
provides increasing stages of protection \(NFPA, 2005\), as illustrated in Figure 5.5. The  
use of physical or psychological devices and methods to discourage undesirable neem

Detect

action is the first level to be employed. Next, one must be able to detect if, when, and  
where an undesirable action or intrusion has occurred. Obstructions should be used  
to impede or limit the action or intrusion if it occurs. Counteractive measures are then  
used to interrupt or neutralize the action or occurrence. Somerson \(2003\) advises that  
defensive strategies should prevent, isolate, and then contain a situation, and the  
deployment of procedural and technological tactics must be sufficient for the  
response to be timely and effective.  
Security personnel must be provided with clear instruction regarding where they  
are to be, what they are supposed to be protecting, how long they are to be doing  
their job \(beginning and ending times\), and the procedures for responding to  
actions, occurrences, or conditions that might be encountered. It is advisable to also  
explain why they will be doing this, particularly for volunteer personnel. Berlonghi  
\(1996\) advises that you must clarify the areas of responsibility, actions, and rationale  
of the job assignment, the rules and regulations pertaining to one’s conduct, and the  
specific actions for responding to various incidents. Neen een eee ee ee a aaa aE  
120 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
These instructions may be the basis for an RFP or tender brief, which becomes the  
responsibility of the contracted security firm to incorporate into their job descriptions  
and post assignments. Event organizers should not attempt to directly manage con-  
tracted or facility security forces; they should only define their needs and expecta-  
tions, including specific or emergent vulnerabilities, and leave the supervision of  
implementation to the security firm to limit liability and increase accountability  
\(Silvers, 2004a\).  
Job descriptions should focus on the purpose and objectives rather than detailed  
specifics to facilitate flexibility appropriate to the situation. For example, one might  
specify the need for security patrols around the floor of a trade show to guard  
against thefts or the perimeters of a festival to guard against unauthorized entry.  
Such patrols should be conducted at irregular intervals so that perpetrators cannot  
time their activities according to a scheduled absence \(NFPA, 2005\), and stipulating  
a specific schedule could be counterproductive. In addition, increases or decreases  
inherent in the fluctuation of crowds might dictate more surveillance be conducted  
or be focused on specific areas at certain times.  
# Communications  
Communications between and with the security personnel must be planned for care-  
fully \(see Table 5.10\). Getting the right information to and from the right people will be  
critical, particularly in an emergency situation. The event risk manager should seek  
the advice and counsel of the appropriate law enforcement and other safety and secu-  
rity authorities to determine the appropriate types, levels, and deployment of security,  
and the most effective and efficient communication strategies and protocols, based on  
the type, purpose, scope, site \(and vicinity\), activities, and audience of the event.  
The chain of command and control must be clearly defined and all the appropriate  
security forces must be included in the development of the policies and procedures.  
Obviously, as the intent, extent, or content of the event increases in size or threat vul-  
nerability, the more security and public safety entities will become involved in the  
event protection strategy. Each agency or entity will have its own internal hierarchy  
that must be coordinated within the overall command structure. Protocols must be  
established that clearly define which agency or entity will be responsible for what,  
and when and how command is transferred from one to another.  
Military, law enforcement, industrial security specialists, cowd management spe-  
cialists, and other security experts all agree on the need for an incident command  
center or joint operations center \(JOC\) to serve as a central site that co-locates  
security agencies and operations and serves as the centralized hub of on-site com-  
munications \(Beene, 1992; Berlonghi, 1990; BOMA, 2001; Emergency Management  
Australia, 1999; FEMA, 2001; Fischer and Green, 1998; Hanna, 1994; HSE, 1999; U.S.  
Army, 1985\). Whether an on-site trailer, office, room, booth, or simple table at the  
Table 5.10 Elements of the security communications plan  
Chain of command \* Media/public relations policy  
Command post e Procedures and protocols  
Equipment ¢ Represented groups  
Information needs Loss prevention and security 121  
back of the room, this command post should be established from which the stew-  
ards, guards, or other security personnel are deployed, and through which all  
security-related communications take place.  
On-site communications equipment may include telephones and mobile phones,  
multi-channel two-way radios, pagers, the public address system, and hand-held  
loudhailers. It will be important to establish which entity will provide what equip-  
ment and how these will be integrated into the communications plan. Radio fre-  
quency allocations and message authentication protocols may be required,  
equipment exchange and/or interfacing may become necessary, and visual signals  
such as flags or hand and arm gestures may be employed \(U.S. Army, 1985\). Event-  
specific equipment such as projection screens and variable message boards may also  
become part of the security and emergency communications arsenal.  
External communications strategies must also be devised. This can include secu-  
rity and safety advice and advisories for attendees and participants disseminated  
prior to and during an event. Tarlow \(2002\) advises that security pamphlets and  
warning signage be developed that includes information about people and things to  
avoid, safety and security tactics, and emergency procedures. Public relations com-  
munications in general and procedures for crisis situations in particular must be  
established \(to be discussed further in Chapters 8 and 9\) and integrated into the  
security communications network.  
Incident response and reporting  
Although many of the situations listed below may seem outside the realm of most  
special events, primarily due to the typical celebratory nature of events, it is impor-  
tant to realize that as the stakes and stakeholders rise in value and visibility, and the  
audience and activities increase in scope and scale, such incidents become more pos-  
sible and probable. And, in today’s world, terrorism and agenda-motivated violence  
cannot be discounted.

e¢ Demonstrations ¢ Natural disasters  
¢ Disorderly behavior e Property damage  
e Evacuations ¢ Riots/crowd panic

Sela e Violence  
Security personnel will most certainly be involved in responding to such incidents, as  
might other responders including law enforcement, medical personnel, rescue per-  
sonnel, and others. Many of these incidents will be discussed further in Chapter 6, but  
the event’s security forces \(peer, private, proprietary, volunteer, or contracted\) must be  
prepared to handle the initial response because they will most likely be the first on the  
scene. They must know what and what not to do, who to contact, and what their level  
of authority and responsibility is. Make certain the training and briefing is commen-  
surate with the responsibilities surrounding the response to an incident or condition,  
and provide written instructions for specific threats \(see Appendix E\: Sample instruc-  
tions for security personnel\). ee  
122 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Purpose Report  
of reports contents  
Figure 5.6 Incident reports  
An incident report should be written for each and every incident or condition that  
occurs \(see Figure 5.6\). These reports not only serve as evidence for law enforcement  
and liability protection in lawsuits, they are critically important to the ability to  
anticipate and analyze future event security plans and procedures. As Berlonghi  
\(1990\) notes, incident reports must be factual, unbiased, and accurate. They must be  
prepared on-site, at the time of the incident, so that the individuals are interviewed  
correctly and the actions and/or conditions observed are recorded properly. Security  
personnel must be provided with the materials \(incident forms, witness interview  
cards, pens, cameras, etc.\) and the training on how to properly complete the docu-  
mentation required \(see Appendix K\: Sample incident report form\).  
Incident logs should also be kept so that patterns of injuries or incidents can be  
identified and investigated. For example, numerous cases of gastrointestinal distress  
could suggest a food safety problem with one of your festival’s concessionaires and  
recurring incidents of theft near the back of the trade show might indicate that there  
is an unlocked door at the rear of the hall that should be locked or guarded.  
The incident reporting system should have a centralized data entry methodology  
to ensure information collected can be used effectively, allowing risk managers to  
show that decisions and strategy recommendations have been made based on data a  
Loss prevention and security 123  
rather than instinct \(Somerson, 2003\). After action reports that enumerate the lessons  
learned and recommendations for future events should always be prepared. It is  
important that you be able to identify what worked well and contributed to the  
safety and security of the event as well as the challenges encountered that must be  
overcome, both of which serve as examples in future security planning.  
# Summary  
Risk could be defined as a situation wherein losses could occur. No event is, or ever  
could be, risk free; there will always be exposures to risk. The role of risk manage-  
ment is to prevent and/or reduce the potential loss associated with such exposures,  
which may be achieved by implementing the proper safeguards. Knowing the risks  
and being prepared to compensate for and finance them will make the event organ-  
ization risk resilient.  
Loss prevention encompasses prevention, detection, control, contingency plan-  
ning, and recovery, and must be financed with the appropriate resources, including  
the purchase of insurance coverage as a risk response strategy. The use of an insur-  
ance professional skilled and experienced in events will be an important contributor  
in securing the proper insurance coverage to transfer risk liability.  
Security, a key component of loss prevention, relates to both the protection of peo-  
ple and property and the personnel used to maintain a safe and secure event envi-  
ronment. A security plan must be devised based on the risks identified and the  
resources required to respond. Security measures should be examined and employed  
throughout the event planning process, including physical and procedural deterrents  
and communicating event rules, regulations, and advisories to event attendees and  
personnel in advance. The type and level of security will have an impact on the image  
or marketing objectives of the event, but should always be based on the established  
protection priorities and the objective of avoiding opportunities for dangerous or  
criminal acts by anticipating and controlling access, invisibility, and indifference.  
Key Strategies  
¢ Identify and integrate no-cost or low-cost loss prevention tactics as standard oper-  
ating procedures.  
\* Calculate the amount of the potential loss to determine the level of protection to  
invest in.  
¢ Develop contingency plans that will allow you to work around the condition or  
incident with as little disruption to the event as possible.  
e Find an insurance broker that has experience in the type of events you produce, or  
spend the time to educate the broker using your risk assessment.  
¢ When procuring security services clearly specify what needs to be protected and  
when in an RFP that is based on a thorough risk assessment.  
© Select the right type of personnel for the event context; pop concert security is dif-  
ferent from conference security and providing personal protection is different  
than guarding property.

advance with advisories as appropriate. 124 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

You are coordinating a three-day collector car show at a major expo center that  
includes an auction of American and European classic cars, muscle cars, custom-built  
hot rods, and celebrity vehicles. Approximately 1300 hundred bidders from through-  
out the U.S. and 14 countries are expected as more than 400 cars will cross the auction  
block over the three days, and many of these buyers are planning to pay in cash \(total  
sales at last year’s event were \$22 million\). The ticketed gate show also includes 250  
exhibitors offering related goods and services as well as souvenirs and collectibles to  
the estimated audience of 5000 each day, but the auction itself is only open to qualified

Saturday, and Sunday; and the exhibitor tear-down schedule is from 5\:00 p.m. Sunday  
through 5\:00 p.m. on Monday. Twenty-five of the celebrity vehicles, scheduled to be  
auctioned off on Sunday, will be on display in the center of the main exhibit hall \(Hall  
A\), with the remaining vehicles garaged in an adjacent exhibit hall \(Hall B\) until their  
appearance on the auction block situated inside a third adjacent exhibit hall \(Hall C\).  
The exhibit hall used to garage the vehicles \(Hall B\) is open to the public for an addi-  
tional fee \(free to registered bidders\), but the auction block hall \(Hall C\) is only open to  
registered bidders, which is where they will obtain their buyer credentials and con-  
clude their purchases at the registration office \(open from 9\:00 a.m. to 6\:00 p-m. on

# Introduction  
Emergency preparedness is a discipline and a condition. As a discipline, it is delegated  
to public safety professionals and often mandated by governments to ensure its citi-  
zenry is protected in situations that threaten the health and welfare of humans, dam-  
age to the environment, and threats to homeland security due to acts of God, human  
accident or intention, or technological failures. The condition of preparedness is the  
objective of governments, businesses, event organizations, and individuals to ensure  
emergencies can be dealt with quickly, safely, and effectively, although this is not  
always a certainty.  
Various governments and organizations use different terminology for the disci-  
pline and the various degrees of emergency including civil protection, crisis manage-  
ment, disaster management, and emergency management. The event risk manager  
should become familiar with and use the terminology of the jurisdiction in which the  
event will take place. For our purposes the following terminology is suggested\:  
¢ Crisis\: A sudden or evolving situation that results in an urgent problem that can  
turn into a catastrophe.  
¢ Disaster\: A situation or event that exceeds normal response capabilities requiring  
the use of assets beyond a jurisdiction’s scope of resources.  
e Emergency\: A condition, situation, or occurrence that is or is believed to be endan-  
gering life or property and that requires an urgent response. nn  
128 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
The event risk manager must consider and prepare for the possibility of small and  
large incidents occurring before, during, or due to the event. Emergencies or disasters  
can cause damage, losses, injuries, and fatalities and may be precipitated by unfore-  
seen, unpredictable, or uncontrollable actions or conditions \(or they could actually be  
foreseeable, predictable, and controllable as is often identified in postmortem investi-  
gations\). They may occur within an event or outside the event; either way, they can  
have an impact on the event and its ability to operate. No event is immune.

Emergency management  
Emergency management encompasses the identification of possible emergencies,  
the assessment of their potential impact on the event and event population, deter-  
mining the appropriate responses and the resources available to respond, the proto-  
cols for declaring and responding to an emergency, and the event organization’s and  
its audience’s ability to react appropriately. The event risk manager must consider  
organizational and regulatory policies, support services, facility capabilities, train-  
Ing programs, evacuation plans, communication methods and messages, personnel,  
equipment, vehicles, and current events \(the political, social, or atmospheric climate  
occurring during the event\)  
Widespread guidance identifies the scope of emergency management as a four-  
part approach as shown in Figure 6.1, often described as the life cycle of a disaster.  
The two proactive phases of activity — mitigation and preparedness — include the  
assessment of potential threats and the capacity to deal with them should they occur. Emergency preparedness 129  
Mitigation =\>.

Figure 6.1 The scope of emergency management  
The response and recovery phases address the activities undertaken when it  
becomes necessary to react to an incident or condition and its consequences once it  
has occurred.  
Event organizers are not responsible for managing a major emergency or disaster if  
it occurs; this is the duty of the local authorities. However, there are two important rea-  
sons one should understand what emergency management professionals do and how  
they do it. First, the event organization needs to know how to react to and interact with  
responders to an emergency. They have a system and procedures that will go into  
effect once they are called in, and although you will surrender control to the respon-  
ders, you will still have responsibilities to your constituents \(e.g., attendees, staff, sup-  
pliers, etc.\). Second, the tactics and protocols they use should be emulated in your own  
plans because these principles and procedures have been proven to be effective. The  
core elements of emergency management functions are shown in Table 6.1 and may be  
used to assess the emergency management capabilities of your event organization.  
# Mitigation  
Mitigation is an important first step in the management of emergencies because it  
involves identifying and understanding the types of emergencies, large and small,  
that could occur at an event and then developing strategies that will eliminate those  
hazards that can be avoided and reduce the impact of the others should they occur.  
Awareness is fundamental to the ability to properly prepare for, respond to, and  
recover from the direct and indirect consequences of an emergency \(Crown, the,  
2005a\). This is part of the duty of care owed to attendees — the due diligence that the  
event organizer should conduct. Organizers also have a responsibility to the hosting  
organization to implement appropriate loss prevention strategies to ensure its inter-  
ests are effectively protected during an emergency. These two realms, the attendee en

Bees for breakfast  
Errol Ninow, specialist risk consultant with the firm of Alex Gintan Associates in Johannesburg,  
South Africa, recounts an event he attended at a local horse racing track that demonstrated a  
serious lack of duty of care.  
Known as ‘Breeze ups’ or ‘Breezing,’ 2-year-old juvenile horses are shown to potential buy-  
ers the day before the auction sale. The event included a champagne breakfast for the wealthy  
and international buyers. The setting was perfect with clear skies and sunshine on a wonder-  
ful summer’s day. People milled about the beautifully decorated tented areas admiring the  
iced fruits and other delicious breakfast delights being served. The commentator was extolling  
the virtues of pedigree and conformation of the baby racehorses as each in turn galloped past  
the assembly of about one thousand people who had turned up to enjoy the day.  
A catering truck pulled up behind one of the breakfast marquees and parked right on top of a  
huge African Bee’s nest, which had made its home in the long grass. Within minutes the pick-up  
truck was virtually invisible beneath a swarm of bees. The honey, marmalade, and lush fruit on  
offer for breakfast were descended upon by the massive swarm of bees. The result was total  
chaos. People were running in every direction in a futile attempt to avoid being stung by the  
bees. The screams of agony and fear could be heard hundreds of meters away. Attendees were  
helping one another to cars and driving those badly stung to local hospitals for medical atten-  
tion. Some were allergic to bee stings. Fortunately no one died, but for half a dozen people it was  
touch and go with their lives hanging in the balance. Here’s how the event organizer was cruci-  
fied at the postmortem\:  
1 No medical personnel were deployed  
2 No ambulance was available on site  
3 No local hospitals had been advised of the event  
4 No competent safety officer or person in charge  
5 No emergency planning was done  
6 Access and egress was on foot only to the breakfast site, which was actually in the middle of  
the race track  
7 The PA system could not be heard clearly 120 meters away from the site  
8 No emergency telephone numbers were available \(local hospitals, etc.\)  
9 A proper site inspection had not taken place  
Threat assessment  
The event organizer or risk manager needs to examine the potential causes or condi-  
tions that could create an emergency situation. A threat is defined as the intent or  
capacity to cause loss of life or create harmful consequences to human welfare,  
endanger the supply of essential services and supplies, cause severe damage to  
property or the environment, or jeopardize national or personal security. This could se  
132 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
include natural, human-made, or technological threats, and may be related to the  
event location, timing, activities, or attendees. They could have a sudden or slow  
onset, and could occur a considerable time or shortly before an event or during it.  
They could occur at the event, adjacent to it, or elsewhere completely yet seriously  
affect access or attendance.  
Everything from catastrophic natural disasters to technological failures to weather  
patterns should be examined \(see Table 6.2\). Is the event site vulnerable to a nearby  
industrial accident? Is the location subject to severe meteorological conditions such  
as hurricanes, tornados, or snow and ice storms? Is it subject to geological disasters  
such as earthquakes or land subsidence? How would a power outage affect the  
event activities or an epidemic or pandemic affect the attendance? One must also be  
aware of the social, economic, and political atmosphere; upheavals can cause dis-  
ruptions, decline or collapse of service capability, and may be grounds for complete  
avoidance \(cancellation\).  
It is incumbent upon the event risk manager to research the possibilities and con-  
template what actions or strategies should be employed to reduce the negative  
impact should any of these disasters occur before or during the event. Conduct the  
necessary investigations to identify the types of historical, geographic, geopolitical,  
technological, and regulatory hazards that exist \(Wahle and Beatty, 1993\). For example,  
a meeting organizer might secure facility or area crime statistics from local law  
enforcement or a festival organizer might secure weather statistics from the weather  
service. All event organizers need to pay attention — not only to the internal condi-  
tions of the event and event organization, but also the world outside the insular  
microcosm of the event project.  
Review the types of emergencies that have occurred at similar events, at that event  
location, and at other facilities in the area. Look at the proximity of the event site to  
geographic features and hazards such as seismic faults, bodies of water, major air-  
ports, or facilities that produce, use, or transport hazardous materials. Consider the  
results should a technological system fail \(e.g., power, computers, heating/cooling  
systems\). Carelessness, misconduct, substance abuse, lack of training, fatigue, and  
other factors can result in emergencies caused by human error. The location, design,  
construction, or layout of a facility or structure may enhance safety or pose hazards.  
Look at the regulatory requirements pertaining to the event audience, activities, and  
providers. Look at everything\: the event, its surrounding area, the critical infra-  
structure in the community, and the situations in the world at large.  
Terrorism  
With every actual or threatened terrorist incident that occurs, intense concern grows  
as the incident or threat is covered extensively in the news media, which is precisely  
what the perpetrators are hoping for. The actual casualty statistics from terrorist inci-  
dents, although sensational due to their nature, are small. That is not to say that ter-  
rorism should not be a concern for event organizers because, in today’s world, such  
acts are possible anywhere at any time and guidance suggests that planned public  
events may be prime targets due to the large number of people in attendance, the  
certain sensational and emotional impact, and the guaranteed media coverage  
\(FEMA, 2001\). Cetron, DeMicco, and Davies \(2006\) predict that the amount of ter-  
rorist activity is likely to increase throughout the world in the upcoming decade and  
advise that hotels, restaurants and clubs, transportation systems, and major sports  
events are particularly vulnerable. a! — ee

Mitigating actions include standard safety and security precautions such as proce-  
dures for handling unattended packages or unauthorized parcel deliveries, conduct-  
ing pre-event security sweeps of the site, limiting concealment areas where weapons  
or perpetrators may be hidden, and employing appropriate admittance controls  
\(FEMA, 2001\). It should be noted that although responding to terrorist \(and other  
intentional\) incidents may be the same as any other emergency in terms of life safety  
and property protection, such incidents will fall under the control of law enforcement  
and special tactics may be required to preserve important evidence \(Crown, the, 2005a\).  
Mitigation through contingency planning  
Determine the critical operations and assets of the event \(e.g., key people, revenue  
sources, information, infrastructure, etc.\) and focus your efforts on protecting them  
with contingency plans. As discussed in Chapter 5, contingency plans should be  
developed to mitigate the consequences of the identified threats by addressing the  
disruptions that will occur. Define the potential impact of the incident on human  
welfare, property, and the business of the event. Determine what internal and exter-  
nal preventions and protections exist; decide if you are willing to live with that. Then  
decide how you will respond should a threat manifest itself and support that deci-  
sion with the appropriate funding, physical and human resources, and planning.  
¢ What will you need to do if severe weather requires event postponement or  
cancellation?  
¢ What will you need to do if there is an interruption or loss of power, telecommu-  
nications, or other utility services?  
¢ What will you need to do if local transportation service is interrupted due to dam-  
age or a strike?  
¢ What will you need to do if all your computer systems go down?  
¢ What will you need to do if the facility you were to use has been destroyed by a  
fire or flood?  
Contingency planning is necessary for both the small scale interruptions to the abil-  
ity of the event to continue as planned and being able to withstand the consequences  
of a large scale emergency or incident. If the threat or its consequences are too great,  
or the resources available to mitigate the consequences are too meager, the decision  
to avoid must be seriously considered.  
# Preparedness  
Preparedness includes all the plans made and actions taken to ensure the capability to  
respond to an emergency. Event organizers and/or risk managers should conduct an  
assessment of the external and internal resources, capabilities, and capacity for  
responding to an emergency with the objective to coordinate and integrate response  
activities \(see Figure 6.2\). Identify the existing plans, programs, policies, and response  
resources of the jurisdiction’s public safety authorities, review those of the event  
organization, and determine what gaps or resource conflicts need special attention  
\(Wahle and Beatty, 1993\). Berlonghi \(1996\) advises that meetings with these authorities  
can be very beneficial to the event organization because, in addition to providing a cette eer

clear picture of what will happen should an emergency occur, they will also give the  
event organization insights into how it can synchronize plans and procedures in its  
emergency action plan. At the very least, such meetings will be an opportunity to let  
the local authorities know what to expect regarding the nature and activities of the  
event and to ensure those authorities include the event in its response activities should  
an emergency occur.  
Identify the type, quantity, response time, limitations, capacity, and costs of the  
resources that will be used to respond to an emergency, which can include personnel,  
equipment, supplies, energy sources, communications systems, medical services,  
food and water, and shelter \(NFPA, 2004\). Also determine if or how those resources  
might be restricted or appropriated in a community-wide disaster. For example, is the  
facility you are using designated as a shelter or the last resort refuge in the event of a  
severe weather incident? If so your event space, supplies, and equipment might be  
appropriated for use in response activities. Are any of your vendors designated and  
contracted as suppliers in the community’s response plans? If so they may become  
unavailable or unable to respond to your needs \(e.g., busses or power generators\)  
because the government's resource needs are going to take precedence.  
Emergency action plan  
Emergencies must be planned for by preparing detailed plans \(see Table 6.3\). This  
could include how to quickly and effectively transfer authority from the event  
organizers to the lead emergency response agency, the designation of assembly areas  
for evacuees, the use of public address \(PA\) systems to cellular telephones for com-  
munications, or the need for a first aid kit to a fully equipped on-site mobile hospi-  
tal. The level of response to be provided by the event organization will depend on its  
legal responsibilities, the event context, and the services available. Ee

In order to protect life and limb within a crisis or disaster situation, there must be a  
specific, reasonable, and agreed-to plan of response that can be implemented effi-  
ciently and calmly. Every event project should have a formal, written emergency  
action plan \(EAP\) that addresses the arrangements for emergencies not requiring out-  
side help and for those that do. It should clearly describe what will be done by  
whom, when, where, and how \(Emergency Management Australia, 1999; FEMA, 2001;  
Hannah, 1994; HSE, 1999\). Such plans must be clear, unambiguous, and easy to use,  
include robust notification and activation procedures, and be supported by adequate  
resources \(Crown, the, 2005b\).  
¢ Identification of the emergencies the organization is prepared to handle.  
¢ Clearly established internal and external roles, responsibilities, and structure of  
authority.  
¢ Decision protocols for declaring an emergency and when, by whom, where, and\_  
how warnings will be issued.  
e Monitoring systems, personnel, and protocols \(early warning significantly  
improves outcomes\).  
¢ Notification of the type and location of the emergency situation to and from a cen-  
tral point.  
e Activation of fire/evacuation alarms or other warning or audience notification  
systems.  
e Evacuation of the premises by everybody who does not have specific duties to  
perform.  
¢ Shutdown of machines, appliances, or equipment, securing records and cash, and  
safe storage of chemicals or materials in use.  
Virtually all assembly occupancy facilities in the U.S. are required to have an EAP,  
which should be incorporated into the event’s emergency planning — when and if the  
facility provides you with a copy. Some facilities are hesitant to release their EAP for  
security reasons, but if so, you should have them provide you with the salient points  
necessary for you to coordinate and cooperate with them. At the very least have the  
facility provide a staff tour through the facility to familiarize them with the layout of  
the facility, emergency exits, and the procedures for contacting in-house security or  
emergency personnel. The contents of a site-specific EAP, according to U.S. Occupa-  
tional Safety and Health Administration \(OSHA, 2002, 2005\), are shown in Table 6.4.  
Event-specific plans should include individual action plans for the most likely  
emergencies according to the event location and activities \(see Appendix F\: Emergency  
plan worksheet\). For example, an event held ina tornado-prone area might have spe-  
cific instructions regarding warning alarms and shelter locations, and an event includ-  
ing controversial topics or presenters might include instructions on what to do if a  
bomb threat is received. These instructions may be printed on separate sheets or cards  
for distribution to the appropriate staff. SEERA enrUunsssitins ect

Training  
Two of the most common problems with emergency response plans include personnel not knowing  
what actions to take in an emergency and the lack of training and practice for those who have been  
assigned duties. All event staff, volunteers, and other personnel expected to play a role within an  
emergency action plan must be provided with the proper training and sufficient opportunity to test  
the equipment and protocols they will be asked to employ in the event of an emergency. They must  
know how to summon help, how they will receive instructions, what their duties and responsibilities  
are, and the limits of their authority. Training activities provide desensitization to the crisis, allowing  
individuals to proceed with their assigned responsibilities - doing what they need to do to get through  
the emergency. a  
138 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Conducting training exercises are also important from an evaluation perspective  
because they can help identify planning weaknesses and resource inadequacies, and  
test the efficacy of the command and communications structures \(Berlonghi, 1996\).  
Debriefings should always be included after any exercise, drill, or simulation to  
allow the personnel involved to articulate their concerns about skill levels, expecta-  
tions, and shortcomings as well as potential emotional effects.  
# Response  
Emergency services personnel are the best trained and equipped to handle emer-  
gencies, and you should recognize and include them when planning your internal  
response plans. Emergency responders include variety of public and/or private  
safety agencies designated to respond to emergencies of various types as established  
by a jurisdiction’s emergency response plan. The primary emergency response serv-  
ices to be considered include fire, police, and medical response, but other response  
services may be included based on the event's location and activities or the scope of  
the incident \(see Table 6.5\). The event risk manager should have full contact infor-  
mation for all applicable responders.  
Depending on the size and type of event being held and the activities to be con-  
ducted at the event, emergency response services may be required on site during the.  
event or may simply need to be accommodated efficiently if response is necessary.  
For example, although having firefighters and firefighting equipment on site is not  
typically necessary \(other than the requisite fire extinguishers\), if the program  
included pyrotechnics then personnel and equipment would likely be mandated.  
High-risk events such as powerboat or automobile races and air shows will require  
significant on-site emergency services for participants and spectators.  
If on-site emergency personnel and equipment are not required, the response time  
for firefighters, police, and ambulances to come to the rescue must be determined.  
The access routes for emergency services to the event site must be open and direct,  
and these routes might need to be dedicated exclusively to this purpose. For large

events or expansive event sites, the event organizers should provide all emergency  
response services with a grid overview map of the event site so response to the right  
place within the event site will be quicker. If emergency services personnel are on  
site during the event, they should be provided with full access to all areas of the  
venue, including performer and other restricted areas, and must be provided with  
the appropriate access credentials to ensure such access is not given to imposters.  
Crisis communications  
One of the key elements in a crisis or emergency action plan is the collection, protec-  
tion, and dissemination of vital information. An emergency communications system  
needs to address and enable the notification of emergency responders regarding the  
existence and nature of the emergency, and inform the affected publics \(attendees,  
staff, participants, and providers\) about the actions that need to be taken. One of the  
hazards of a poorly crafted communications plan is that dangerous vulnerabilities  
may be created due to people being uninformed or unconvinced about conditions or  
consequences. Haddow and Bullock \(2003\) advise that a communication plan must  
have the following attributes\:  
¢ Be responsive and informative and manage expectations.  
e Provide information and combat misinformation.  
¢ Be timely, accurate, consistent, and easy to understand.  
e Prevent confusion and maintain credibility.  
Communication plans must also include the strategies and protocols for informing the  
internal and external publics regarding the status of the emergency through a desig-  
nated spokesperson and a specific media plan. When dealing with the media, your  
objective is to tell your story before someone else tells it for you \(Regester and Larkin,  
2002\). Designate an area where the media may work, provide an interview area that will  
accommodate cameras, provide escorts to other areas of interest, and have a one-page  
handout for the media on the background history and nature of the event \(Hodge, 2005\).  
Additional guidance on media plans and spokespersons will be covered in Chapter 9.  
The event organizer should develop an event-specific communications plan that  
includes such strategies as creating and distributing an emergency contact list to  
staff and volunteers; collecting emergency contact information from attendees and  
designating someone to call the emergency contact should an attendee become ill,  
injured, or die; designating someone to follow up with attendees who were treated  
and released; and arranging for emergency message boards, Web sites, and call-in  
centers. This plan should be integrated with a facility’s plan, specifying the duties  
and responsibilities the event staff will assume on behalf of the event organization.  
A specific who-to-contact protocol should be established that identifies the hierar-  
chy for notification and the individuals \(and their alternates\) charged with notifying  
emergency response personnel. Guidance may also be included. on the use of cellu-  
lar phones, which may or may not be reliable in certain circumstances, and the most  
effective emergency numbers. For example, cellular phone calls to the universal  
emergency telephone number \(e.g., 911 in the U.S. and Canada, 112 or 999 in the  
U.K., 112 in the E.U., 000 in Australia, 120 in the mainland of the Peoples’ Republic  
of China\) may require the provision of information such as exact location and caller  
identity for the proper dispatch of services, and calls to the in-house emergency  
number may be more appropriate or effective when in a hotel or convention center. i

# Recovery  
Being prepared for an emergency includes being able to live through and carry on  
after an emergency. All emergency management or disaster plans should include  
post-incident recovery components. These recovery strategies may encompass any-  
thing from the recovery from the psychological and emotional trauma by the per-  
sonnel and participants involved in the emergency to the administrative, financial,  
promotional, and operational recovery of the event organization.  
Examining the recovery responsibilities and tactics employed for a major disaster  
illustrates the most extreme consequences, which can then be scaled down for the  
event organization according to the severity of the incident. The recovery functions  
the authorities will be undertaking are shown in Table 6.6 and may serve as a guide-  
line for the actions the event organization may also need to conduct.  
A disaster takes the scope of an emergency into a mass casualty situation with a  
broader impact than simply the event itself. It should be noted that a casualty is a  
person that has been either injured or killed and a victim is a casualty or a person  
directly impacted by the incident. The first priority is the protection of people and  
getting them safely out of danger should a crisis or catastrophe occur. Then the  
emphasis is on consequence management and the continuation of services.  
Consequence management encompasses the actions necessary to prevent the  
escalation of an emergency’s impact by protecting public health and safety, restoring.  
essential government services, and providing relief to governments, businesses, and  
individuals affected by a disaster. In the U.S., for example, the Federal Emergency  
Management Agency \(FEMA\) has existing arrangements with 26 federal agencies  
and the American Red Cross that may be involved in response and recovery opera-  
tions including the emergency support functions of transportation, communica-  
tions, public works and engineering, firefighting, information and planning, mass  
care, resource support, health and medical services, urban search and rescue, haz-  
ardous materials, food, and energy \(Haddow and Bullock, 2003\).  
For the event organization, particular attention should be focused on the care and  
treatment of its affected publics including the attendees, participants, and personnel,  
including the injured, uninjured survivors, the deceased, and the family and friends  
of casualties \(Crown, the, 2005a\). Medical treatment for the injured, from on-site first  
aid to transportation to a medical facility, will be an immediate need. Short-term  
shelter and first aid will likely be needed for uninjured survivors who could be suf-  
fering shock, anxiety, or grief, or may simply need assistance with contacting friends  
and relatives or finding alternate transportation or temporary accommodations.  
They will also be important witnesses in any incident investigations and interviews  
will likely need to be conducted. Fatalities will fall under the jurisdiction of law  
enforcement and the coroner’s office, yet it may fall upon the event organizers to  
assist with identification and family notification.  
. Family and friends will be deeply and urgently concerned about the status of the  
incident and the condition of their loved ones, sometimes resulting in overloaded  
communication systems. Call centers may be set up by response agencies or the event  
organization to accommodate incoming inquiries. Care must be taken to authenticate  
the relationship of the inquirer to the casualty to ensure confidential information is  
not released, and one should never release the name of a victim until the next of kin  
is notified. Sheltered locations may also need to be set up for survivors and relatives eee

waiting information about missing family and friends to provide welfare and protect  
them from the more aggressive and less reputable media.  
Consideration must also be given to the effects an emergency could have on the  
event operations if the emergency occurs before the event is scheduled to take place.  
If a disaster occurred at a destination you had selected for an upcoming event, you  
will want to know its recovery capability and prognosis. In addition to the condition  
of the facility and event-specific services you had contracted, you must assess the  
condition of the other attributes and attractions that contributed to the selection of the  
site, as well as the location’s infrastructure in general. For example, although a pre-  
mium destination prior to hurricane Katrina in late August 2005, projections indicate  
that it will be at least 2008 before a high percentage of meeting planners will schedule  
their conventions in New Orleans again \(Cain, 2006\). A planned event could not real-  
istically be postponed for three years, therefore alternate arrangements would need  
to be made, and quickly, in order to proceed within a reasonable time period.  
# Evacuations  
Events typically involve large numbers of people gathered in a limited space.  
Therefore it is important to understand the characteristics of and techniques for  
effective evacuations of an event site or premises. The need to evacuate an event site  
could occur for any number of reasons including natural, accidental, or intentional  
emergency incidents, with severe weather the most probable for outdoor events and  
fire for indoor events. Berlonghi \(1996\) notes that there are three intentional reasons  
for evacuation including remedial — in response to something that has taken place;  
precautionary — in anticipation or for the prevention of a dangerous situation; and  
tactical — in response to a specific warning and targeted area, often related to geo-  
logical or meteorological threats and hostage or terrorist situations.

NCAA game delay  
March 16, 2006\: The Cox Arena at San Diego State University was evacuated when a hot dog  
cart attracted the attention of two bomb-sniffing dogs during a security sweep about two  
hours prior to the first-round game in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tourna-  
ment, an immensely popular national college basketball championship. The start of the game  
was delayed by about 70 minutes as the concession cart was investigated and another full  
security sweep was conducted. The teams and fans had not yet entered, but some personnel  
and vendors were inside the 12 000-seat arena and were evacuated, and all were kept at a safe  
distance until it was determined there was no danger to the public. In an effort to get back on  
schedule for the nationally televised series of four games that day, pre-game warm-ups for the  
teams in the second contest were moved to a nearby gymnasium and the transition time allot-  
ted to clear and refill the arena between the first and second sessions was reduced, which  
resulted in many fans missing the starting portion of the second-round game \: ASS SSS SSS SSS SSCS SSS SSS SESS SSS SSS SSS  
Emergency preparedness 143  
An evacuation plan delineates the decision-making procedures, audience com-  
munication methods, and exit route configuration and condition. As noted in Table  
4.2, the evaluation of the efficacy of an evacuation plan will include the nature of the  
event, nature of the occupants, crowd density, access/egress movement, means of  
egress, flow capacity, communications systems, and personnel preparedness.  
Most public assembly facilities have detailed emergency and evacuation plans in  
place, but the event risk manager should not take this for granted. Unusual or unde-  
veloped sites will require the creation of an emergency response plan including evac-  
uation procedures, protocols, and means of egress. This should be prepared in  
consultation with the applicable emergency response services and public safety agen-  
cies. Typically it is a facility’s legal responsibility to declare and instigate an evacua-  
tion in an emergency, and the event organizer has the obligation to comply and  
coordinate efforts with those in authority. Once official emergency responders arrive  
\(e.g., police, fire department, etc.\), they have authority over all other private entities.  
The event organization should integrate its resources into the evacuation plan as  
appropriate. For example, security personnel and event staff may be used to help  
direct people at critical points along the evacuation route, and pre-determined gath-  
ering points away from the building or event space may be established where atten-  
dees and personnel may be accounted for. Any evacuation plan should also include  
specifics for assisting those with special needs such as those with mobility, hearing,  
or sight impairments and those who speak a different language, including any addi-  
tional requirements or characteristics specific to the event production and audience.  
Audience preparation is a key component of preparedness and successful emer-  
gency response \(NFPA 101, 2000\). Audience preparation for properly responding to  
an emergency begins before an emergency occurs by ensuring they are in a state of  
awareness. This may include pre-event communications and on-site signage, mate-  
rials, and announcements.

The Special Event adopts author's recommendations  
In 2005 The Special Event, the annual convention produced by Special Events Magazine,  
adopted my recommendation to request all presenters make fire safety announcements at the  
beginning of each session, and included the following instructions and script I wrote for them  
in their Speaker Information Packets\:  
e Please take a moment to review that attached guide to emergencies. As the person ‘in front,’  
you WILL be the ones counted upon to interpret announcements, sirens, or alarm bells and  
to instigate a quick and calm evacuation of the space you are in.  
e In all sessions please announce\: ‘In accordance with The Special Event’s commitment to  
safety at ALL events, please note in case of emergency, leave by the nearest exit, which may  
not be the way you came in. Please look around now and locate the nearest exit to you.’  
A Guide to Emergencies brochure provided by the Miami Beach Convention Center was also  
included in the Speaker Information Packet, which outlined their emergency capabilities and  
procedures for evacuation, fire, hurricane, and bomb threat, and included all the appropriate  
contact numbers. i

Human behavior and movement factors  
Safe and effective evacuation is not reliant exclusively on physical factors such as  
clear and unobstructed exit routes and signage. It must also incorporate the psycho-  
logical behavior of the people involved in the evacuation situation. The Society of  
Fire Protection Engineers highlights the factors that contribute to the ways in which  
people respond to an emergency situation — a fire \(SFPE, 2002\). These factors are also  
applicable to movement behavior in practically any crowded or crowd situation.  
People’s movement is based on the cues received, the pre-movement and trans-  
movement decisions they make about those cues, and the physical conditions facili-  
tating or impeding that movement, as shown in Table 6.7.  
Au, Ryan, Carey, and Whalley \(1993\) identify the response behavior process as to  
sense, interpret, plan/decide, and act; they identify the following factors that affect  
individual ability to perform these functions\:  
¢ Ability to sense\: conditions in the environment; availability and clarity of information.  
e Ability to interpret\: content of information; information source; knowledge, experi-  
ence, and expectations.  
e Ability to plan/decide\: knowledge and experience; goal and objective; alternatives  
and choices; consequences; mental condition and emotion.  
° Ability to act\: physical condition of the individual; physical characteristics of the  
venue; physical conditions at the venue.  
Fruin \(1984, 1993\) identifies the four interacting elements in a crowd situation as time,  
space, information, and energy or crowd force, which significantly impact an evacu-  
ation egress. These can converge to create potentially fatal crowd densities due to bot-  
tlenecks caused by architectural configuration and inaccurate perceptions of  
conditions and urgency. Still \(2001\) characterizes the factors in emergency egress  
dynamics as objective \(escape from danger\), motility \(individual movement speed\),  
constraint \(density and environment interactions\), and assimilation \(reaction time\),  
and compares this model to Jonathan Sime’s 13 egress assessment parameters includ-  
ing communication, mobility, social affinity, alertness, role, position, commitment, Emergency preparedness 145  
focal points, familiarity, visual access, crowd density, enclosure, and complexity.  
Mileti and Sorensen \(1990\) describe these as warning receiver attributes\:  
¢ Environmental attributes\: physical and social cues \(others reacting\) and proximity  
in distance or time.  
¢ Social attributes\: network \(family, community\), resources \(physical, social, eco-  
nomic\), role \(age, gender, responsibility, status\), culture \(ethnicity, language\), and  
activity \(working, resting, engaged in recreation\).  
¢ Psychological attributes\: knowledge \(of hazards, protective actions, plans\), cogni-  
tions \(stress, risk perception, locus of control\), and experience \(type and recency\).  
¢ Physiological attributes\: disabilities.  
What should be noted is that one of the common factors is experience or familiarity —  
familiarity with the hazard, the venue, the cues, the options, and the exit routes.  
Research shows time and again that, in an emergency, most people will try to leave  
the same way they came in, which is why it is important to familiarize attendees with  
their other options before an emergency occurs, and may indicate the need to employ  
stewarding personnel to redirect individuals to the closest or most appropriate exit.  
The other common factor is information — the accuracy and authority of the infor-  
mation the individual is given that shapes their reaction and decision to start to move.  
Mileti and Sorensen \(1990\) contend that a warning system must incorporate the warn-  
ing response process of hearing, understanding, believing, personalizing, deciding to  
respond, and confirming in order to take appropriate protective actions. The nature  
and the content of the warning will also have an impact on whether or not it is effec-  
tive, including the warning source \(officialness, credibility, and familiarity\), channel  
\(types and number of mediums used\), frequency \(number and pattern\), and message  
attributes that make them convincing and reasonable \(Mileti and Sorensen, 1990\),  
shown in Table 6.8.  
Fruin \(1984\) advises that people in a crowd situation cannot see the whole picture  
and are highly susceptible to rumor unless clear and complete communications take  
place, and stresses that a PA system must be connected to the emergency lighting cir-  
cuit or other standby power source in case of a power failure. Still \(2001\) advises that  
people rely on authority figures in times of crisis and suggests that clear chains of  
command are almost equally as important as clear routes of exit.  
Mileti and Sorensen \(1990\) suggest that frequent and official warnings help people  
focus on accurate information rather than rumor and inaccurate or non-official data.  
They also expose several myths about emergency warnings such as public hysteria,  
keeping information simple, the ‘cry wolf’ syndrome, the first warning instigates  
action, and people follow instructions blindly. People do not panic except when in a  
confined space and there is an immediate and clear threat of death or injury. People  
are information hungry in a warning situation and repetition is important. People  
will trust a new warning if the explanation is given regarding why the information in  
the previous alarm was false. Most people seek more information and validation of a  
warning message before taking action, often because they do not recognize what var-  
ious signals \(e.g., alarms or sirens\) mean. People will not automatically follow  
instructions without the reason for them and that reason must make sense.  
Berlonghi \(1990, 1996\) recommends the preparation of carefully worded scripts for  
emergency announcements that a well-trained announcer can deliver in a calm and  
authoritative manner. All such announcements should begin with a polite request for  
attention, end with a thank you, and be repeated a minimum of two times. Some ee ee

sonnel that a specific type of incident has occurred. Evacuation information and  
instructions may also be printed in event programs and posted on on-site signage for  
non-controversial circumstances such as severe weather or earthquakes.  
Medical emergencies  
The most likely emergency that will occur at an event is a medical emergency wherein  
someone has been injured or suffers from an illness that must be attended to immedi-  
ately. It is estimated that one percent to two percent of an event audience will typically  
require medical attention during the course of an event; approximately 99 percent of  
these casualties representing mild to moderate injuries or illnesses that may often be  
handled on-site. Good sense and duty of care demands that the provision of emergency  
medical services \(EMS\) to respond to this must be carefully considered.  
In order to assess the likelihood and potential severity of a medical emergency, the  
event risk manager should consult with the venue and local emergency medical  
responders such as ambulance services or other health authorities regarding the  
type and scope of the event, audience demographics and expected behaviors, and  
the size, location, and layout of the event site. Outdoor or undeveloped sites in par-  
ticular need special consideration regarding geographic conditions and the antici-  
pated weather. Special attention must also be given to audiences including the very  
young and the elderly, events of long duration, those including alcohol service, and ee ee ee  
Emergency preparedness 147  
events with a history of crowd disturbances \(e.g., concerts or sports events\). It is also  
important to include the pre- and post-event operations and personnel when plan-  
ning EMS.  
It is highly recommended that a medical services provider be appointed to over-  
see this assessment and develop, as well as deliver, the emergency medical response  
system for larger, more complex public events \(Berlonghi, 1996; HSE, 1999\). At the  
very least the event risk manager must determine the existing capabilities of the  
event venue and local community, and then develop the response plan accordingly.  
The capability assessment should consider the services available at the event venue,  
including the first aid facilities and equipment such as portable automated external  
defibrillators \(AEDs\), and identifying which staff members have been certified in  
first aid procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation \(CPR\) and the Heimlich  
maneuver. Private and public ambulance systems and response times should be  
identified, and the location of and route\(s\) to the designated receiving hospital or the  
closest medical facility or emergency room to the event site should be determined.

Helicopters for medical evacuation  
In the lead up to a community festival, a representative from the local hospital mentioned that  
there must be a space for helicopter to land in case there was an emergency. The festival takes  
place near the coast and the emergency helicopter is used for sea rescues, transporting victims of  
any accident at sea to the hospital. The festival committee’s response to this problem was to  
‘rope’ off a helicopter landing area. This was to make sure that the public would not be in dan-  
ger and that the helicopter could land. On the surface this solution seems logical and one that  
most festival organizers would use to exclude crowds from an area. During the festival, how-  
ever, the helicopter needed to land. When it came to the landing area the blades of the helicop-  
ter caused such an updraft that the rope was in danger of being sucked into the blades. The  
result was that the helicopter could not land in that space. The life experience of all the commit-  
tee members did not include helicopter landings, therefore could not foresee such a problem.  
Had they discussed the plan with the aeromedical provider directly, and appropriate perimeter  
control strategy could have been devised.

Scope and level of on-site medical services  
Guidance varies widely on what scope and level of medical service is sufficient at an  
event, primarily because every event is different. Berlonghi \(1990\) suggests that a  
registered nurse with a physician on call should be the minimum requirement for a  
small event. NFPA \(2005\) specifies that EMS personnel should be on site for events  
with crowds over 10000, and the telephone number for calling them should be read-  
ily available at all events. Mass gathering manuals for Australia and the U.S. advise  
that events with fewer than 500 patrons and located in close proximity to ambulance  
or hospital services generally do not require on-site EMS personnel; at least one  
on-site first aid post with two trained personnel are required for any event with more en ee  
148 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
than 500 patrons; two on-site posts and 12 personnel for events with 10000 patrons;  
and that every event venue should have at least one designated climate-controlled  
first aid room with power and running water \(Emergency Management Australia,  
1999; FEMA, 2001\). The Health and Safety Executive \(HSE, 1999\) in the U.K. sug-  
gests a formula that specifies, at a minimum, two first aid personnel per 1000 for the  
first 3000 in attendance at small events where no special risks are considered likely,  
and that no event should have less than two first aiders. Tarlow \(2002\) recommends  
a baseline of one EMS staff person per 1000-1500 participants and four paramedics  
per every 10000 participants. Although there are no international standards there  
may be specific requirements in individual jurisdictions, therefore the event risk  
manager should always check with local authorities.  
EMS can range from having an ambulance stationed on site, a first aid tent or  
room, or an on-site infirmary or hospital, and personnel can range from first aiders  
certified in basic first aid to emergency medical technicians \(EMTs\), paramedics, and  
registered nurses and physicians on site or on call. The factors to be considered will  
include the number of people expected \(including personnel and providers\), the  
environment, the activities, the audience demographics, and the access routes and  
response times for responders.  
It is best practice for event organizations to ensure all their staff is trained in basic  
first aid. Such courses are affordable and widely available from such charity-based  
international organizations as the Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies and St. John  
Ambulance. Many of these societies and other community organizations often have  
experience in and are prepared for providing EMS to events at a reasonable cost \(pos-  
sibly partially deductible as a charitable donation\), and a local hospital or health serv-  
ice organization might be willing to coordinate and provide this service as a sponsor  
at a large public event. Ensure that all volunteer or contracted EMS providers and  
personnel have the proper credentials and malpractice insurance \(Berlonghi, 1996\).  
Site considerations for on-site medical services  
In medical emergencies, quick response can mean the difference between life and  
death. The site considerations for positioning on-site medical services include the scope  
and layout of the area, how help will be summoned, how help will reach the injured  
person, and casualty extraction and transportation to the first aid station and evacua-  
tion to the hospital. All event staff and security should know the location and route to  
the first aid area or areas, and these positions should be on highly visible on-site navi-  
gational signage, identified in PA announcements, and printed in collateral materials.  
Communication modes and methods must be established between event person-  
nel and on-site medical personnel. All medical response personnel must have com-  
munications capability with off-site medical services. All on-site first aid personnel  
should be uniformed distinctively \(e.g., T-shirts, tabards, or jackets\) so that atten-  
dees will be able to locate the correct assistance in a crowd. These uniforms should  
be uniquely color-coded and words such as ‘Medical’ or ‘First Aid Team’ printed on  
them \(Berlonghi, 1990\). Of note, a red cross, as designed by and registered to the  
International Red Cross and its National Societies, should not be used unless offi-  
cially sanctioned by them. A white cross on a green or dark background with the  
words ‘First Aid’ is often used instead.  
Crowd density conditions may indicate the need for roving first aiders or medical  
teams on foot, bicycle, or golf carts. Injured person extraction might include hand-  
carried stretchers or golf carts equipped with litters for large event grounds, and a  
Emergency preparedness 149  
evacuation could include ambulances, four-wheel drive vehicles for difficult terrain,  
or even a helicopter pad or landing strip for aeromedical response. It is not recom-  
mended that private vehicles be used for transport unless absolutely necessary.  
On-site first aid facilities for patient evaluation and attention should be positioned  
to ensure rapid access from all areas of the event site and provide patient privacy  
\(Silvers, 2004a\) and it may also be important to consider religious, cultural, or ethnic  
requirements that may relate to medical treatment and gender proximity issues  
\(Crown, the, 2005a\). These facilities must be clearly visible and provide rapid and  
unobstructed access for the entrance and exit of ambulance service. If more than one  
first aid post is provided, one must be designated as the primary facility \(HSE, 1999\)  
and should be located near the event entrance or the location with the best ambu-  
lance ingress and egress capacity.  
Medical incident procedures  
Untrained personnel responding to a medical incident should immediately call for  
medical help, should not do more than they are trained to do, and should not  
attempt to move a victim unless it is necessary in order to remove them from immi-  
nent danger. Consent should be obtained from the victim, or the parent or guardian  
if the victim is a minor, before providing care \(consent is implied if the victim is  
unconscious\). The immediate vicinity should be cordoned off to protect the privacy  
of the victim and prevent further injury or interference with medical treatment by  
curious or concerned by-standers. An injury or illness incident report should be  
filled out for every medical contact made with event staff or medical personnel, even  
if minor, and especially if care or treatment was refused.  
Incident reports, treatment logs, and refusal of treatment records must be docu-  
mented and maintained for potential liability claims, public health and medical insur-  
ance requirements, and event history and statistical purposes. Medico-legal issues  
such as access to records, record and data retention, and consent forms must be con-  
sidered when planning this documentation \(Emergency Management Australia, 1999\)  
and strict control must be exercised over the confidentiality of this medical informa-  
tion \(Berlonghi, 1990\) including medical condition and contact information collected  
prior to the event. For example, many convention and meeting organizers ask for  
emergency contact information \(e.g., name and day /evening /cell phone numbers\) as  
well as the name of the attendee’s hotel in the registration process, which is then stored  
in a different database and discarded after the conference. Sport events often require  
medical information from participating athletes, also disposed off after the event.  
# Summary  
Emergency preparedness is just that — being prepared to respond to and manage an  
emergency. Key components of managing an emergency or crisis efficiently are early  
warning, the unambiguous delegation of duties, and avoiding panic. In many event  
contexts and sites, emergency response plans are created and governed by local pub-  
lic safety agencies. This, however, does not excuse an event organizer from seeking out  
these plans and providers. It requires the event risk manager to confirm their existence  
and merge them into the event's operational plans, or in their absence create, organize,  
and implement them. The proper methods for monitoring the potential causes of an ntact  
150 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
emergency situation, including precautionary measures and trained observers, must  
be incorporated into the overall event plan and operations.  
The event manager or event risk manager should emulate and coordinate efforts  
with emergency responders, including access requirements, evacuation and the  
treatment of victims, and the protocols for multi-agency response or mutual aid  
agreements. Should an emergency occur, the appropriate response must be imple-  
mented, which could range anywhere from assisting or ejecting specific individuals  
to evacuating the entire event site. And in an emergency, attendees must be clearly  
informed of the situation and the appropriate behavior. They must be given credible  
and forceful information regarding the severity of the situation and practical instruc-  
tions for the actions to be taken.  
Being prepared is legally, morally, and professionally the right thing to do. Medical,  
fire, and weather emergencies occur all the time. Some are small, some large, and some  
catastrophic. It is far more likely that it will be the smaller emergency that you will need  
to deal with, but if a natural disaster such as hurricane Katrina can virtually destroy one  
of the most popular tourist and convention destinations in the U.S., it could happen  
where you are planning to hold your next event. It is your duty to be prepared.  
Key strategies  
e Liaison with applicable emergency response services and public safety authorities  
to become familiar with their procedures for emergency response and to ensure  
they are aware of your event and activities.  
\* Confirm that the event location and the facility have formal emergency action  
plans in place and that these are regularly tested with the appropriate drills.  
¢ Create an internal, event-specific emergency action plan for every event.  
\* Create a contact list for all key emergency response services.  
e Ensure there is a succession plan for people assigned key responsibilities or  
decision-making authority.  
¢ Conduct audience preparation activities such as pre-event advisories and on-site  
signage and announcements.  
¢ Determine the distance and directions from the event site to area hospitals and/or  
trauma center and the response times to the event site for ambulances.  
e Ensure all volunteer, employed, or contracted event personnel know how to rec-  
ognize emergency and medical incidents and how to summon the proper help.  
e Ensure key event staff are certified in basic first aid, CPR, and the Heimlich  
maneuver.

# Safeguards  
Every event is a complex business  
Our festival is 30 years old and it’s always been a success. Just have my administra-  
tive assistant organize the meeting. We’ve always done things this way and have  
never had a problem. Let’s put on an event; it will be so much fun. What's the big  
deal ... this isn’t rocket science.  
These common assertions reflect the misunderstanding of the serious business of  
events and the scope of activities required to produce one. A badly organized or  
poorly managed event is a very risky situation. And the fact that an event went well  
does not guarantee that it was well managed — it may have been just lucky! \(Even for  
30 years.\) Luck has no place in the events industry, and luck certainly has no place in  
sound risk management practices. Good luck, or to put it more accurately the illusion  
of good luck, requires hard work — to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson, ‘the harder I  
work, the luckier I get.’  
There are countless parts to an event that must be linked together to create an  
effective business plan that achieves the purposes for having the event. And events  
must be approached as a business, complete with a robust organizational founda-  
tion and excellent business practices. The three chapters in this section will familiar-  
ize you with the interconnected and interdependent complexities of the business of  
events, including administration, communications and marketing, because the qual-  
ity of the event’s business practices will have a direct correlation to the type and  
scope of risks associated with that event. scurianl talqmoa & things eee 8

# Introduction  
An event is a project, and the administrative functions such as time management,  
financial management, human resources management, and procurement manage-  
ment, and the systems used to implement and integrate them are typically included  
within the discipline of project management. The tools, techniques, terminology,  
processes, and procedures used by project managers in many other industries serve  
the event organization equally well, particularly in the pursuit of effective adminis-  
trative practices and risk management.  
Project integration, in particular, is critical in order to coordinate, synchronize, and  
merge the variety and multitude of interactions, dependencies, and interconnected  
elements and resources included in an event project. This is to ensure that decisions  
made incorporate all the factors influencing and influenced by those choices. The  
integration of risk management throughout the organizational structure and project  
planning helps manage of the scope of an event and its exposures to risk.  
Scope management, one of the key tools the project manager uses to manage a proj-  
ect’s resources, is comprised of scope definition and scope control. Scope definition is  
the specification of the sum total and the limits of the responsibilities and elements  
included in an event project, which are established within the design of the event ET  
158 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
program \(the intent, extent, and content\). The statement of work \(SOW\) and the work  
breakdown structure \(WBS\) define the responsibilities, elements, and tasks required to  
create the event \(PMI, 2000\). The definition of success, which comes from the host or  
key stakeholders, helps to identify those items and elements that must be included,  
should be included, and could be included. Establishing a sound organizational struc-  
ture, business plan, and timeline will help define the resource allocation and logistical  
requirements as well as contain the scope by defining the sources of potential scope  
creep \(changes to the scope\) and the responsibilities and tactics for its control.  
Time management  
Time management is the establishment and verification of the timelines, production  
schedules, and schedule controls that will facilitate the activity architecture necessary  
to accomplish the tasks associated with the event project. As discussed in Chapter 1,  
every event project has a limited time dimension into which all the tasks required to  
produce the event must be scheduled. Being a limited and finite resource, time restric-  
tions will determine the tempo of the event management processes, as well as define  
certain critical milestones and areas of risk. Kendrick \(2003\) advises that the sources  
of schedule risk fall into the three categories of delays, dependencies, and duration  
estimates.  
Schedules will typically include the overall timeline that encompasses the entire  
scope of the project and a production schedule that will cover the event from move-  
in to move-out, both of which are created using the techniques shown in Figure 7.1.

Figure 7.2. Activity dimension of the timeline  
These schedules may be seen as time maps showing the scope and intensity of activ-  
ity required in order to achieve objectives throughout the life-cycle of the event proj-  
ect, as illustrated in Figure 7.2.  
Activity definition  
The scope and deliverables of the event project must be clearly defined in the SOW,  
including the dates and times of the event and its components. Incomplete scope  
definition will lead to inaccuracy throughout the development of the timeline and  
will increase vulnerabilities throughout the event project. The SOW is then used to  
create the WBS, which may be approached from the top down — decomposing or  
carving the project into pieces, or from the bottom up — brainstorming the required  
activities and organizing them into clusters.  
It is often useful to organize the WBS into the hierarchical categories \(e.g., depart-  
ments and committees\) to be used for the organizational structure and the budget to  
facilitate integration and efficient tracking. Identify the various tasks and determine  
those whose responsibility it will be to accomplish them, and seek input from these  
individuals to uncover additional task requirements and potential constraints that  
could affect the efficacy of the schedule.  
Consider this... 7.1  
Peace conference causes controversy  
After attending a peace conference in India in 2005 as an invited speaker, a state senator  
returned home in the U.S. with a vision to conduct a similar endeavor in his state. The senator  
introduced legislation during the 2005 and 2006 sessions and got approval for two consecutive  
budget appropriation requests for the conference, totaling \$420 000. Both appropriations were a  
160 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
transferred to the state’s tourism department, which would be in charge of planning the con-  
ference, scheduled to take place in September of 2006. The first appropriation of \$120 000, allo-  
cated on July 1, 2005 \(the beginning of the fiscal year\), was spent on forming an executive  
committee, issuing press releases, creating a web site, and contacting potential speakers.  
The controversy started to brew when the tourism department put out a request for propos-  
als \(RFP\) in June of 2006 to subcontract a new coordinator because the employee organizing the  
conference was due to retire on June 30, 2006. The RFP, published on the department’s web site  
on June 20, 2006, required proposals be submitted no later than 4\:00 p.m. on June 30, 2006. On  
July 1, 2006 it was reported that insufficient proposals had been submitted, and on July 17 it was  
announced that the tourism department was withdrawing its RFP, had hired an event planner  
\(whom had not submitted a proposal\), and that the conference would be postponed until May  
of 2007.  
This postponement, the short-time allotment for the RFP process, and the revelation that only  
one speaker had been lined up just three months before the scheduled event all conspired to give  
the impression of poor management and misappropriation of taxpayers’ money. Although the  
tourism department tried to counteract this negative press, the mishandling of the scheduling,  
especially in light of the known retirement date of the key staffer, brought a great deal of contro-  
versy to what was intended to be a public relations success. Had the tourism department  
released documentation that illustrated comprehensive project plans were in place, including a  
timeline with status reports, the tempest might have been averted, but no such documents were  
available, which fueled the claims of mismanagement of an ill-conceived venture.  
Activity architecture\: critical path analysis and  
# sequencing  
Activity architecture may be viewed as the structure of work incorporating the task  
dependencies, interactions, and priorities that will influence the sequencing of activ-  
ity. This is often accomplished using the critical path analysis. In traditional project  
management, critical path analysis uses forward planning to identify the projected  
completion date, but in events management where the completion date \(or time\) is  
pre-determined \(and typically immoveable\), the critical path analysis is used as a  
backward planning tool \(Getz, 1997; Silvers, 2004a; Tum, Norton, and Wright, 2006\).  
Dependencies, those tasks dependent upon prior completion of another task, must  
be clearly identified and given the proper precedence within the schedule. They must  
be closely monitored because delays here will affect the remainder of the schedule.  
Milestones \(key deliverables\) and deadlines should be established and dependencies  
that pose delay risks, the weakest links, should be highlighted \(Kendrick, 2003\). These  
milestones and deadlines often become the triggers and thresholds \(see Chapter 2\) for  
risk response actions. Development and use of a graphical tool \(e.g., bar charts, flow-  
charts\) to devise and communicate the critical path is widely recommended. Smith  
and Merritt \(2002\) recommend showing task connectors in bar charts to illustrate the  
critical path, and Thomsett \(1990\) urges the inclusion of decision and verification  
points in flowcharts so that critical choices and repetitive or alternate procedures are  
correctly applied.  
Estimating the time it will take to complete tasks can be a significant cha \:  
Kendrick \(2003\) suggests that this is onersdte to optimism, ee eae aoe  
information, and scope creep. Yates \(2003\) calls this the ‘planning fallacy’ wherein rr  
Administrative safeguards 161  
the belief that we will accomplish tasks in less time than is actually required and the  
neglect of obstacles \(i.e., best-case-scenario assumptions\) when forecasting time  
needs leads to poor judgment. PMI \(2000\) recommends expert judgment and analo-  
gous estimating are effective tools, including the review of prior events to determine  
previous or chronic schedule variances.  
Activity attributes and duration requirements must be identified and analyzed in  
the context of time restrictions and resource management. Time is linear and irre-  
placeable; the only way to expand time is to compensate by adding other resources, in  
other words, do more, be more productive within the time given. However, as Lewis  
\(1997\) points out, effective resource allocation is contingent upon the skill levels, capa-  
bilities, capacities, and outputs of the particular people and suppliers \(i.e., a chain is  
only as strong as its weakest link\).  
Sequence and synchronize tasks in a chronological arrangement. Identify those  
tasks that must be conducted consecutively, those that may be performed simulta-  
neously, and those that have flexibility \(Lewis, 1997\). Identify the tasks and their  
resources that could be diverted to critical path activities \(Weiss and Wysocki, 1992\),  
and provide redundant paths for accomplishing critical path activities whenever  
and wherever possible \(Smith and Merritt, 2002\).  
Schedule development and control  
Create a calendar-linked master schedule, including the agendas from all suppliers,  
that reflects the aggregate planning of the entire event project through all its phases.  
Identify areas where resource leveling and duration compression may be applied  
\(PMI, 2000\), and seek ways to minimize idle time for personnel and equipment,  
which can be expensive and often leads to subsequent time pressures that can create  
vulnerabilities and hazards as tasks are rushed and workers become frustrated  
and/or harried \(Monks, 1996; Van der Wagen and Carlos, 2005\). Make certain exter-  
nal or cultural restrictions such as holidays and holy days, seasonal implications  
\(e.g., vacations or weather vulnerabilities\), and working conditions \(e.g., days of the  
week or limits on the number of hours per day\) are factored in.  
Develop a timeline that reflects the critical path and integration of the tasks to be  
accomplished \(e.g., executing a venue contract will include the legal department, the  
site selection committee, the operations manager, various suppliers, and numerous  
other areas of responsibility\) and distribute it to department heads. Verify the accu-  
racy and efficacy of the proposed schedule with these key stakeholders. Make any  
necessary adjustments and then prepare and circulate individual schedules in the  
required detail based on the consensus schedule. These might include or be supple-  
mented by timelines, Gantt or milestone charts, deliverable deadlines lists, produc-  
tion schedules, program agendas, or at-a-glance calendars.  
Schedule control encompasses the monitoring of deadlines, tracking of perform-  
ance, analysis of schedule variances, and usage of change control mechanisms.  
Smith and Merritt \(2002\) identify three primary reasons why it is important to be  
proactive about schedule monitoring and control\:  
e Late attention to problems leading to expensive workaround tactics.  
e Late detection of problems precluding solutions available earlier.  
e Late surprises limiting the time to develop adequate resolutions.  
Create and implement performance measurement methodology that will signal  
schedule variances, indicate its magnitude, and guide corrective actions. As noted nnn  
162 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
above, the earlier the problem is diagnosed, the more response and reaction time  
there is and options there are to overcome it. Develop and utilize change control  
mechanisms that will indicate a change is required, authorize that change, and inte-  
grate that change into the project scope and schedule. Make certain schedule updates  
are communicated throughout the event organization when any changes have been  
made, because no change is a small change \(Augustine, 1997\).  
Financial management  
The risk manager must have a good understanding of financial management in  
order to mitigate the financial risks associated with an event operation. Financial  
management is the development and use of budgets, proper costing and pricing  
strategies, standard accounting practices, and asset and cash flow management to  
achieve the financial goals of the event enterprise. Money, or its equivalent \(e.g.,  
goods or services\), is necessary for any event to take place. There must be sufficient  
funding allocated to every aspect of the event organization and operation, including  
risk management, for the event to be realistically feasible.  
The typical financial risks associated with events are shown in Table 7.1, many of  
which are preventable or controllable if the proper policies and procedures for  
accounting and budgeting are developed and consistently implemented. Legal com-  
pliance \(operating legally\) is the first line of defense against financial losses and the  
use of written contracts and change orders will control the scope of financial obliga-  
tions and liability. Then, effective budgeting, sound bid procurement and evaluation  
practices, and sensible cash management procedures will enable one to anticipate  
income and expenses correctly, allocate financial resources properly, plus maintain  
the appropriate financial records.  
Policies and procedures for operating legally  
Every event and event organization should have a reliable accounting system that  
accurately records how, when, where, why, and by /from whom monies are expended  
and received, as well as the measurement of assets \(e.g., money, accounts receivable\),  
liabilities \(e.g., accounts payable\), and earnings. This system, and the bookkeeping  
functions associated with it, is best devised by or in collaboration with financial pro-  
fessionals such as certified or chartered public accountants. The financial data that is  
categorized, summarized, interpreted, and communicated through this system helps  
the event organization make good financial decisions \(Silvers and Nelson, 2005\).

Administrative safeguards 163  
The financial records and the policies and procedures used to document and con-  
trol spending are essential to illustrate compliance with many of the legal require-  
ments for doing business — and an event should be run as a business. One must be  
able to show shareholders, stakeholders, or auditors that there are sufficient and  
effective internal controls that safeguard assets and justify expenditures, and that  
these are implemented in a consistent and comprehensive manner. These controls  
might include, but are not limited to, the following\:  
¢ Bookkeeping procedures \(e.g., transaction posting, coding underlying documents,  
etc.\)  
¢ Budget approval procedures \(e.g., committees, client, governing board, etc.\)  
¢ Contract approval procedure \(e.g., review by counsel, signing authority, etc.\)  
¢ Credit policies and procedures \(e.g., extending credit, payables and receivables,  
etc.\)  
Expenditure approval process \(e.g., requisition forms, change orders, etc.\)  
Procurement policies and procedures \(e.g., RFPs, purchase orders, etc.\)  
Refund policies and procedures \(e.g., cancellation deadlines, prorated amounts, etc.\)  
Reimbursement policies \(e.g., per diems, expense reports, etc.\).  
Budget development and control  
The budget is one of the primary planning documents used when organizing an  
event, and according to Bowdin, Allen, O’Toole, Harris, and McDonnell \(2006\) it is  
an effective control mechanism used to impose financial discipline and track the sta-  
tus of the event plan performance. When developing the budget, profit objectives  
must be determined \(which influences pricing decisions\), costs and revenues must  
be forecast, and financial resources must be defined and then allocated according  
to priorities. Then the budget performance must be closely monitored with budget-  
to-actual reports to identify and correct deviations in a timely and cost-effective  
manner.  
Budgets are created in a progressive manner beginning with a draft budget based  
on conceptual estimates from historical records or comparable events \(Bowdin et al.,  
2006; Goldblatt, 2002\). This will likely be refined and validated by various event  
departments or committees and then approved by the client or governing entity.  
Although Berlonghi \(1990\) suggests that budget preparation should occur prior to  
operational planning, the final pro forma \(projected\) expense budget, which is based  
on quotes from and contracts with suppliers, is typically not completed until late in  
the planning process \(Nadler and Nadler, 1987\) because cost \(and income\) estimates  
are more accurate as the event nears \(O’Toole and Mikolaitis, 2002\).  
Bowdin et al. \(2006\), Nadler and Nadler \(1987\), O’Toole and Mikolaitis \(2002\), and  
Van der Wagen and Carlos \(2005\) all emphasize that the budget is a plan, not a defin-  
itive document, and as such must remain flexible and responsive to changes that  
may be needed due to additional line item costs, revised priorities or opportunities,  
or if expected revenues \(e.g., sponsorship money or ticket sales\) under perform.  
Budgets reflect the decisions made about the event and communicate the income  
and expense estimates, which is not the same as authorizing expenditures \(Nadler  
and Nadler, 1987\). They should be used to show various departments or committees  
the projected spending limits \(Bowdin et al., 2006\), but it must be made clear how  
and by whom financial commitments may be made. nn

Host committee busts the budget  
An international association typically held its annual educational conference in a city that had  
a local host chapter, with the host chapter expected to provide assistance in locating appropri-  
ate local vendors and content presenters and to cover the costs that exceeded the per person  
budget allocation of the opening night reception. The host committee was provided with the  
entire pro forma budget showing all categories and projections, and was relied upon to find  
local sponsors for increasing the quality of the reception and to forward all other supplier rec-  
ommendations to the conference planner at headquarters.  
Not understanding their limits, the host committee proceeded to enter into contracts and  
make purchases for all areas of the expense budget without approval from international head-  
quarters, which ultimately put the final costs for the conference at nearly 30 percent higher  
than projected and resulted in a net loss rather than the profit that was expected for this  
important portion of the association’s annual revenues. Immediately following this financial  
fiasco the association put together a policy manual that defined the procedures for authoriz-  
ing expenditures and circulated it to all future host chapters, yet it still took several years  
before host chapter attitudes and spending could be completely reined in.  
The structure and scope of a budget will vary according to the type, size, and gov-  
ernance of the event, but it should identify all sources of revenue and expenses in suf-  
ficient detail so that variations can be identified and corrected easily. This also  
facilitates the ability to make changes based on priorities rather than panic. When  
forecasting income and cost estimates, revenue projections should be conservative  
and expense projections should be generous. Examples of typical revenue and  
expense budget categories may be found in numerous meeting and event manage-  
ment texts \(see, e.g., Bowdin et al., 2006; Connell, 2002; Goldblatt, 2002; Krug, 2000;  
Van der Wagen and Carlos, 2005\).  
\_ The budget should also be integrated into the project timeline with cash flow and  
decision milestones carefully noted because changes typically increase in cost the  
closer one gets to the event \(Bowdin et al., 2006\) and last-minute changes can be  
expensive because there is little time or supplier impetus for price negotiation.  
Nadler and Nadler \(1987\) recommend a budget allocation of 3-10 percent to cover  
inflation and changes between budget approval and the time of the event, and Van  
der Wagen and Carlos \(2005\) suggest this contingency category be funded at 5 per-  
cent if there is confidence that costs are controllable and 10 percent if there are  
numerous variables or cost uncertainties.  
Budgets should have pre-determined cost-cutting strategies integrated into the  
expense side linked with decision deadlines in the timeline in order to make changes  
that are guided by the prioritized goals and objectives of the event. Budget perform-  
ance must be monitored closely to ensure these decisions minimize financial risk,  
maximize opportunities, and maintain the integrity of the event. Silvers and Nelson  
\(2005\) offer the following observations and suggestions\:  
¢ Link payables and receivables within the cash flow schedule.  
e Develop creative cost-saving and cost-avoidance opportunities. LE Ente tm hh  
Administrative safeguards 165  
¢ Standardize budget categories for easy comparison.  
e Prevent fraudulent activities with clear policies and procedures.  
It is important to recognize that the expenditures allocated to risk management activ-  
ities are often viewed as an expense that can be reduced when budgets must be cut  
because they seemingly do not directly contribute to the event content, environment,  
or experience. This faulty perception must be overcome with forceful justifications  
that defend these expenditures, reiterating the advantages of such investment and the  
liabilities for its avoidance. Spending money up front prevents having to spend even  
more money at the back end.  
Costing and pricing  
Costing and pricing are closely linked together because the cost of the event will  
determine the price of admittance to the event, or the feasibility of the event if admit-  
tance fees such as tickets or registration fees are not a factor. The purchase price ceil-  
ing \(the maximum the buyer is willing to pay\) for attending or hosting an event will  
affect what types and levels of goods and services can be included in the budget.  
Profit requirements must be determined. Is this event meant to make a profit \(and  
how much\), break even, or to be hosted? If the event is expected to generate revenues  
over expenses or to break even, then a break-even analysis \(also known as a cost-  
volume analysis\) must be conducted that identifies at what point \(number of attendees  
or per person admittance fee\) the revenues will equal the expenses, and consequently  
at what point profits are generated. If the event is hosted, with the only revenue source  
being the host, a bottom-up analysis should be conducted, which calculates the sum  
total of all the costs and the ‘price’ the host will have to pay to fund the endeavor.  
Accurate cost estimates require a very detailed list of line items that encompass all  
the direct and indirect costs, fixed and variable costs, time and opportunity costs \(e.g.,  
personnel numbers/skill levels, in-house/outsourcing, extending credit\), cost of  
goods and services, selling costs, and countless ‘hidden’ costs \(see Table 7.2\). Make  
certain all bids and subsequent contracts specify all charges and potential charges

pated expenditures.  
Cash flow and cash handling  
Cash flow represents the financial ‘life blood’ and its circulation through the finan-  
cial system of the event project. Without sufficient infusions of revenue at the right  
times, even the best-laid event plans will soon fail. In addition, because revenues  
typically do not start coming in before expenses must start being paid out for a high  
percentage of events \(Silvers and Nelson, 2005; Van der Wagen and Carlos, 2005\),  
funds in the form of capital must be identified and secured in order to safely operate  
during this deficit period. For annual events such as festivals or conventions, this  
capital most often comes from the profits from the previous event. One-off or first-  
time events must seek this capital elsewhere, often relying on sponsorship sales,  
government grants, credit, or deposits from the host or hosting organization.  
Manage cash flow with a time-phased budget that indicates when revenues and  
expenses are expected in order to negotiate and schedule income and disbursements  
to your best advantage. This may include time-phased pricing strategies, providing  
or exploiting incentives for prompt payment or seasonal discounts, and establishing  
timetables for contractual deposits and other payables and receivables.  
Cash, checks, and credit card transactions constitute the primary ways that revenue  
comes into the event and secure money handling procedures must be established to  
mitigate exposures to theft, fraud, and errors. From cash payments from petty cash to  
cash income from such things as ticket sales, registration payments, donations, or con-  
cessions at the event, these procedures must encompass all the ways that cash flows  
into and out of the event enterprise throughout the life-cycle of the event project.  
Good office procedures are important for pre-event cash handling. For example,  
Berlonghi \(1990\) advises that pre-numbered cash receipts and petty cash vouchers be  
used and carefully monitored, and ‘For Deposit Only’ with the account name and  
number should be stamped on all checks immediately upon receipt. On-site cash man-  
agement will entail preparing point of sale reports, preparing cash reports, reconciling  
cash, and processing debit and credit card transactions. Collections and monitoring  
cash handling at an event must also be supervised carefully so losses do not occur.  
Silvers and Nelson \(2005\) suggest the following on-site cash handling procedures\:  
e Set up a secure office or area with a lockable safe to serve as an on-site bank or  
treasury.  
Establish the issuance and closeout protocols for cash drawers.  
Make certain anyone that handles money on-site is bonded.  
Keep the numbers of personnel handling cash funds to a minimum.  
Schedule the periodic cash collection and cash drawer culling from cash collection  
points based on the volume of cash expected.  
Establish the counting procedure to ensure the amounts are recorded by location.  
Establish internal and external auditing procedures for ticket sales and souvenir  
sales \(e.g., sales records, unsold tickets, and cash deposit receipts\)  
Financial reporting and record keeping  
Accurate financial data drives quality decision making, authenticates successes, and  
illustrates weaknesses in the financial plan. Therefore, this data must be captured, Administrative safeguards 167  
interpreted properly, and communicated within an appropriate reporting and  
record keeping system that provides clear, accurate, and complete reports for stake-  
holders, staff, management entities, and governmental authorities. Tum et al. \(2006\)  
stress that this system must be capable of providing fast and accurate financial data  
in order to ensure the financial agility and stability of the event enterprise, which  
highlights the importance of meticulous bookkeeping procedures and the benefits of  
using technology such as financial management software.  
Reports must be prepared at such times and in such a way that the financial data is  
presented in a manner that communicates the necessary information \(in the appropri-  
ate context\) to those receiving them. Financial statements must be prepared according  
to regulatory requirements and are generated at a variety of times and for a variety of  
purposes such as at tax time or when seeking loans or sponsorships. Financial records,  
including underlying documentation, must be retained as legally required and in such  
a manner that facilitates access in order to analyze and take advantage of the valuable  
information they contain. And because this information has value and is often propri-  
etary, access to it must be protected and the release of it must be prudent.  
Human resources management  
It is widely recognized that people are one of the most valuable resources for an event,  
and guidance on strategies for managing the paid and volunteer human resources for  
events is available in numerous books on events management \(see, e.g., Bowdin et al.,  
2006; Getz, 1997; Goldblatt, 2002; Silvers, 2004a; Tum et al., 2006\) plus countless addi-  
tional sources on human resources management in other contexts \(see Online resources  
at the end of this chapter\). Human resources management encompasses the formula-  
tion of the appropriate organizational structure, policies, and procedures for the recruit-  
ment, orientation, motivation, training, compensation, supervision, and discipline of  
employees, contracted workers, and volunteers according to applicable employment  
and labor legalities to provide a suitable and diverse workforce to meet the needs of the  
event project. The typical risks associated with human resources for meetings and  
events are shown in Table 7.3.

Figure 7.3. Building blocks of effective human resources management  
Successful personnel management is dependant upon establishing and employing  
the basic building blocks shown in Figure 7.3. It must be noted that this represents a  
cyclical and integrated system that relies on building the organizational structure and  
culture that serves the needs of both the event enterprise and the people within it.  
Workforce planning must be conducted, roles and responsibilities must be deter-  
mined, the hierarchy of authority and responsibility must be established, and job  
descriptions and selection criteria for personnel must be developed. Then staff and  
volunteers must be recruited, inducted, oriented, trained, assigned, guided, and  
rewarded in a suitable manner so that these valuable human assets are able to be pro-  
ductive and may be retained for continued success.  
Building the organizational structure and culture  
It takes lots of people to produce a successful event, even the smallest event. All their  
personalities, preferences, experience, functions, and levels of expertise will help  
shape the success of the event. Making certain all these people come together and  
perform efficiently and effectively is like putting together a puzzle. The organiza-  
tional chart, sometimes called an organogram, is a graphical representation of the  
structure of authority \(i.e., the right to determine and direct the actions of others\) and  
responsibility \(i.e., accountability for assigned duties\) for the event operations or the  
event organization and will be the picture revealed when the puzzle is complete.  
This chart should include all the necessary departments, committees, sub-  
committees, and/or event elements. It should illustrate the lines of authority — who is  
in charge of which elements, who is responsible for what, who can and will make deci-  
sions, and how they all relate to each other. It must take into consideration those stake-  
holders or influencers within the event organization and those outside the event  
organization in order to establish the appropriate chain of command and channels of  
communication. Administrative safeguards 169  
The scope and arrangement of the organizational chart for an event will depend  
on the scope of the event and its elements, plus the various departments required to  
conduct the business of the event organization. According to Getz \(1997\) the organi-  
zational chart outlines the functions in a compartmentalized manner along with the  
inclusion and a clear definition of the governance structure of the enterprise. These  
charts should be comprehensive and descriptive yet, as Van der Wagen and Carlos  
\(2005\) advise, simple and streamlined enough to illustrate reporting relationships at  
a glance, particularly for emergency situations, which may indicate the need for  
macro- and micro-versions for different recipients.  
Whereas the organizational structure defines the hierarchies, reporting relation-  
ships, and the way that work flows through the event enterprise, the organizational  
culture is shaped by what the organization does, its mission and values, its leader-  
ship style, in short — its personality. Many event organizations reflect a less bureau-  
cratic system than other businesses might due to their very purpose \(typically to  
create and produce a jovial gathering\), but this makes it even more important to  
ensure that the span of control, limits of authority, and channels of communication  
are clearly defined and specified within the organizational chart.  
Getz \(1997, p. 136\) warns that although a less formal or team-oriented structure  
may facilitate a certain level of camaraderie and efficiency, it ‘can subvert policy and  
control processes’ and Silvers \(2004a, p. 387\) cautions against allowing committees  
or functional teams to become ‘fiefdoms’ with uncontrolled power. Given these  
caveats, Frame \(2003, pp. 251-252\) advises creating an ‘environment of competence ...  
where people will not cause problems through their actions and inactions and where  
they are capable of solving problems effectively when they arise.’  
When assessing the risks associated with an organization’s structure and culture,  
the risk manager should first look for well-crafted and coherent mission and vision  
statements that are supported with written policies and guidelines that facilitate  
empowerment to make decisions that conform to legal and ethical requirements \(see  
Table 7.4\). Policies or procedures often reflect statutory compliance issues governing  
employment as well as the organization’s guiding principles, and they need to be  
communicated and implemented consistently throughout the event organization  
and the event operations. The number and type will vary based on the size, scope,  
and location \(jurisdiction\) of the event organization, but it is prudent to consider and  
address a broad range of these issues early in the organization’s development  
because they often represent common improprieties and previous legal disputes.  
This is also why legal counsel should be consulted regarding all written policies to  
ensure compliance with pertinent employment laws and regulations.  
Staff acquisition and preparation  
Finding enough people, and the right people, to bring an event to life is far more  
complicated than simply putting out a Help Wanted sign. It requires workforce  
planning including a job analysis, job summary, job descriptions, job specifications,  
and selection and evaluation criteria \(Bowdin et al., 2006\) before recruitment ever  
begins. The extent of this planning will vary depending on the size, type, and juris-  
diction of the event, but without at least minimal planning the event workforce, paid  
or volunteer, may become a liability instead of an asset. Typical risks include per-  
sonnel that do not perform as expected because they do not understand their duties,  
they do not have the skills or experience to do the jobs assigned, or the real reason  
they are there is to watch or ‘be at’ the event rather than work the event. i

A needs assessment should be conducted that identifies the number of personnel  
\(with which skills\) necessary to accomplish the tasks required. This is often accom-  
plished using the WBS, reviewing previous staffing plans, and polling committee or  
department heads. The various jobs need to be analyzed to determine the major func-  
tions and performance elements associated with each job, often called a functional  
analysis, and a job summary should be created that outlines the purpose and respon-  
sibilities of the position. One should also factor succession planning into the needs  
assessment to mitigate the loss of key personnel through resignation, incapacitation,  
or large or small disasters \(or unreliability — that volunteer just didn’t show up\).  
The job analysis and summary are then incorporated into a job description that  
should clearly identify the principal duties and expectations of the person filling that  
position, including the time commitment \(Bowdin et al., 2006\). It may also be advis-  
able, especially for volunteer positions, to specify why the task/job is important and  
the consequences if not performed properly, and it may be necessary \(i.e., duty to  
warn\) to specify any potential exposure to contaminants, weather, ergonomic dangers,  
or other hazardous working conditions.  
Some positions require specific qualifications - competencies necessary to per-  
form the job at the level of performance required. The job analysis should include the  
definition of the specific physical or technical skills, training, credentials, or licenses  
required for the position, plus the personal characteristics or attributes someone per-  
forming that job should possess \(e.g., attention to detail, dependability, etc.\), which  
is included in the job specifications. Berlonghi \(1990\), for example, advises that min-  
imum age requirements \(e.g., 21 years of age\) be set for volunteers. One must be  
careful, however, not to delimit abilities or discriminate against disabilities when  
establishing these specifications.  
The job description and specifications will form the basis for the selection criteria,  
which should be clear for both the event and the applicant in order for expectations to  
be met, and must comply with legally approved criteria to prevent liability. The selec-  
tion criteria should be mirrored in the evaluation criteria for performance appraisals,  
and the evaluation criteria should reflect and feed back into the job summary and job Administrative safeguards 171  
specifications. Again, these must fall within legal parameters in order to prevent lia-  
bility for unlawful or unfair dismissals.  
Recruitment activities should be designed to ensure all expectations and opportu-  
nities are transparent. They should be conducted at such times and places and with  
various methods so they are accessible and the event will be able to attract a compe-  
tent, committed, and diverse workforce. This may entail traditional as well as inno-  
vative recruitment strategies, particularly for volunteer corps as discretionary time  
dwindles. The first place to look is within the event’s constituency \(e.g., supporters,  
fans, etc.\), but care must be exercised because it is precisely these people who will be  
most interested in ‘attending rather than working’ while on the job.  
Gloria Nelson, CSEP, president of Gloria Nelson Event Design, LLC in Wisconsin,  
engages student volunteers in ‘learn’ or ‘learn and earn’ opportunities whenever  
they arise. She advises that you must ‘make sure you provide the student volun-  
teer\(s\) with a comprehensive packet of overview, policies and procedures, job  
descriptions, production schedule, logistical mapping, signed waiver of liability and  
emergency/safety/radio protocol. Depending on the number of volunteers and the  
length of project and/or service, ensure provision of things such as a Green Room  
for their comfort and security of their personal belongings, appropriate meal and  
beverage availability, and reimbursing them for mileage or public transportation if  
possible.’  
Hiring and induction activities may include conducting background, criminal,  
credit, and/or reference checks for certain positions, particularly those dealing with  
money handling or contact with children. The event organization needs to know  
who it is hiring or accepting as a volunteer because it could be held liable for recom-  
mending incompetence \(Foster, 2002\) or jeopardizing safety and security \(Moody,  
2005\). This reinforces Berlonghi’s advice that ‘walk-up and last-minute volunteers  
should not be allowed’ \(1990, p. 57\). A personnel record should be created for every  
employee and volunteer staff member that includes, at a minimum, all contact infor-  
mation \(e.g., name, address, telephone numbers\) and an in case of emergency \(ICE\)  
contact name and number. The scope and content of employee records will be dic-  
tated by the employment laws within your jurisdiction. All personnel records must  
be prepared, stored, and protected as confidential information.  
Following the administrative induction, all personnel should be provided with a  
formal orientation wherein the individual is introduced to the event, its mission and  
history, its culture and leadership, and its location and the staff. This is when key  
policies and procedures, typically included in an employee manual or volunteer  
handbook, should be reinforced, and should be delivered in both written and oral  
formats due to different learning styles and literacy limitations. Although such ori-  
entations for events are often designed to build enthusiasm and boost social interac-  
tion, it is important to communicate the risk messages that will protect the safety  
and welfare of the personnel as well as the attendees. These include guidelines  
regarding handling incidents, reporting hazardous conditions or activities \(decrimi-  
nalizing risk\), and permission to avoid danger. Safety is everyone's job.  
From the event organizer to the casual volunteer, inexperience is often cited as one  
of the biggest risks in events management. This can usually be overcome through  
training, mentoring, and, to put it bluntly, experience. The job analysis identifies the  
tasks and the level of performance required, which will be used to evaluate the train-  
ing needs of the personnel available and acquired. Show individuals how and allow  
them to practice the procedures and operation of equipment they will be asked to  
use during their job. Van der Wagen and Carlos \(2005\) emphasize the fundamental a  
172 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
responsibility of customer service for all personnel and point out that anyone wear-  
ing a uniform or staff badge, regardless of their role, will be expected by attendees to  
be able to answer questions. Therefore, all staff should be provided with the answers  
to the most frequently asked questions and know where assistance can be provided  
\(e.g., first aid, welfare services, etc.\).  
Performance motivation and monitoring  
Motivation is a personal state based on an individual’s motives. It is incumbent upon  
the event organization to identify the reasons their paid and volunteer personnel take  
on a job and craft the compensation, recognition, and stimulation strategies that will  
fulfill these needs and desires and thereby motivate high-quality performance. It is  
advisable to ask why an individual is applying for the paid or volunteer position,  
either on the application form or when conducting a job interview. This may identify  
strategies that will enhance their effectiveness and reliability, such as placement within  
a team comprised of or scheduled with their friends or free admission to allow access  
to an event component upon completion of duties \(a typical reason for volunteering\).  
It can also expose potential problems such as the desire to be near certain celebrities or  
participants, which could be mitigated with increased supervision or, in the case of  
volunteers, declining their offer of service for this particular job. Care must be exer-  
cised, however, to ensure this is not done in a prejudicial manner.  
Supervision, particularly of inexperienced personnel, is crucial to ensure the per-  
formance of one’s duties meets the needs of the event organization. This is not a  
policing activity; it is a mentoring and coaching activity — being accessible to answer  
questions and providing guidance. Supervision, and performance appraisal, is a  
two-way activity; there must be feedback systems integrated into this process and  
questions and recommendations from staff should be vigorously encouraged. It is  
advisable to develop checkpoints within the timeline and during the event produc-  
tion that allow for corrective actions to be taken in a manner that protects the event  
operations and takes advantage of learning opportunities for the worker. Never  
leave a worker ‘stranded’ — without access to the physical, informational, and emo-  
tional support needed to accomplish his or her duties.  
Conduct performance reviews at the close of the event for all personnel and ona  
periodic basis throughout the duration of employment for employees. This, again, is  
not an adversarial or faultfinding activity. Look for ways to enhance individual per-  
formance and professional growth. Look for weaknesses in the recruitment, orienta-  
tion, training, monitoring, and recognition strategies so that the lessons learned may  
be integrated into future endeavors.  
Workforce relations  
The workforce for an event becomes a small, often insular community, and within  
any community there are sure to be conflicts, personal or procedural, and times  
when discipline and even dismissal becomes necessary. Conflict and dispute resolu-  
tion procedures should be established that provide the mechanism for grievances to  
be heard and addressed in a timely and impartial manner, and without disrupting  
the event operations \(e.g., take it outside, take it up with this manager, take it up  
after the event\). If and when discipline becomes necessary, it is important to use cor-  
rective rather than punitive disciplinary measures because ‘errors are rarely due to  
malice’ \(Silvers, 2004a, p. 390\), however it should be made perfectly clear what LT RATER EE SESS SASS SSS SS  
Administrative safeguards 173  
behavior or actions will not be tolerated under any circumstances \(e.g., violence,  
theft, intoxication, etc.\). Discipline, and termination if it becomes necessary, should  
always be conducted in private and in such a way that protects the individual's dig-  
nity and he or she is accorded proper respect.  
Many events are held in places and facilities that fall under the jurisdiction of cer-  
tain labor unions, which will dictate specific \(or specific numbers of\) personnel and  
working conditions such as hours and pay rates. There are several distinctive risks  
that should be considered when dealing with unionized labor. First, contracts for  
workers acquired from a labor union should be carefully scrutinized to ensure you  
have a complete understanding of the work rules and restrictions you will need to  
abide by, as well as the rates you will be charged \(e.g., straight time, overtime, double  
time\), which, according to Sorin \(2003\), can also include employee benefits such as  
health insurance, vacation, and retirement contributions, as well as payroll adminis-  
tration. Second, the event organizer should investigate the status of union contracts  
at a selected facility or locale to determine the potential for labor disputes that may  
lead to labor strikes, picket lines, or other disruptions. Also, in some cases there are  
several different unions representing different areas of work \(e.g., electricians and  
craftsmen\) that must be dealt with, and occasionally there are jurisdictional disputes  
between unions regarding their authority claims to the work to be done.  
When securing temporary staffing or contract workers from personnel agencies or  
casual labor services you should also scrutinize the contract to make certain you have  
a complete understanding of your financial and working condition obligations. In  
addition, you must recognize and adhere to the supervisory protocol specified within  
the contract so that any liabilities rest with the appropriate entity; if direction and  
control authority and responsibilities are subverted, you may find liability shifts over  
to you. It is also a wise strategy to require all contracts with vendors or independent  
contractors specify that their workers shall not be considered your employees.  
Procurement management  
Procurement management is the sourcing, selection, and contracting of the suppliers  
and vendors from whom goods and services will be procured using accurate solici-  
tation materials and quality criterion, suitable documentation, change controls, and  
cost avoidance to ensure purchases will deliver cost value. Good procurement man-  
agement practices facilitate risk management by determining the risks associated  
with the individual vendors or suppliers and the business interactions with them,  
including but limited to those shown in Table 7.5.  
As illustrated in Figure 7.4, procurement is a sequential and integrated process con-  
sisting of procurement planning, solicitation planning, solicitation, source selection,  
receipt/consumption and review, and contract administration and closeout \(PMI, 2000;  
Silvers, 2004a; Tum et al., 2006\). Monks \(1996\) clarifies this by stipulating the responsi-  
bilities associated with procurement include delineation of needs, identification of sup-  
ply sources, supplier selection and contracting, and performance monitoring, and  
suggests that purchasing should be done in collaboration with individuals with spe-  
cialized product knowledge to prepare the specifications, as well as with those receiv-  
ing and using the goods or services and those administering the contracts and payment  
functions. Tricker \(2001, pp. 97-98\) advises that ISO 9001\:2000, international standards a

Figure 7.4 The procurement process  
for quality assurance, specifies that an organization must have documented procedures  
and ‘a process to ensure appropriate selection, evaluation and control of all purchased  
products \[or services\].’ This encompasses the procedures for identifying requirements  
the evaluation and selection of suppliers, usage of solicitation and purchasing docu-  
ments, verifying the product or service meets specified requirements, and the adminis-  
tration of contracts and purchase documentation. Administrative safeguards 175  
Procurement policies and practices  
Procurement is a sales process, often subject to highly variable quantitative and quali-  
tative criterion, numerous alternatives, and significant pressure on buyers from  
sellers. It is important to establish procurement policies in accordance with legal  
requirements and ethical guidelines that provide a framework for procurement deci-  
sion making. The need for a formal framework increases as the scope and complex-  
ity of the purchasing to be done increases, with large events requiring significant  
collaboration across numerous departments \(MPI, 2005\). For example, sponsorship  
agreements generated through the marketing department may restrict the use of  
direct competitors as suppliers for the event, and the purchase of products or services  
from those suppliers could jeopardize sponsorship negotiations or result in a breach  
of contract with the sponsor.  
In addition, increasing regulatory attention is focused on the procurement practices  
of public or publicly held entities, including events and event hosts \(e.g., corporations\),  
that seeks to limit or prohibit questionable activities that may influence purchase deci-  
sions \(e.g., gift giving, amenities, complimentary travel, etc.\) \(MPI, 2005\). It is advisable  
to develop procurement policies that address the ethical issues identified in Table 3.10  
in Chapter 3 so that all procurement activities are transparent and principled.  
It is also important to develop decision-making systems that include the accurate  
delineation of product or service specifications; the application of pertinent criteria,  
rules and restraints to the decision process; the facilitation of suitable deliberation and  
collaboration; and ensuring the proper authority and empowerment are granted. This  
may include defining the bid and/or proposal review process, including appropriate  
consultation, and standardizing contract language \(MPI, 2005\) in order to facilitate  
negotiation within specific parameters. Decision systems should identify the applica-  
ble decision mode or modes \(i.e., who or what will make the decision\) \(Yates, 2003\).  
This might include, for example, consensus decision making, a single decision maker,  
majority vote, scoring system, or threshold criteria \(e.g., every purchase over a certain  
amount requires three bids\).  
Most event organizations will establish specific purchasing practices, such as  
tracking and payment systems for payables and receivables \(e.g., purchase orders,  
invoices, etc.\) and authorization procedures to ensure only those with authority are  
able to spend the money. As illustrated in Consider this... 7.2, without clear pur-  
chasing policies and procedures, unsanctioned spending encumbrances may be  
made that undermine effective ‘supply chain management,’ which strives to create  
efficiencies that reduce costs \(MPI, 2005; Tum et al., 2006\).  
Procurement planning and solicitation  
The first step in procurement planning and solicitation is to determine the need for  
and scope of contracted goods and services. Consider what you need, when you  
need it, and whether this is best procured from inside or outside the organization.  
Monks \(1996\) suggests conducting a value analysis in which the function and cost of  
a potential purchase is examined, including whether the need is actually valid and  
the features are truly necessary, and if there are lower-cost options that will perform  
the same functions. One must know which products or services are critical to the  
event to ensure quality control and that contingency plans are in place.  
The next challenge is to stipulate the specifications for contracted goods and services  
and identify the supplier sources that are suitable, capable, and qualified to provide tt

them. It is important to remember that there could be liability for recommending  
incompetence based on supplier or subcontractor performance or carelessness \(Foster,  
2002\). It is also prudent to identify alternatives to sole-source suppliers. Monks \(1996\)  
recommends that a database of potential suppliers be developed and continuously  
maintained. Large organizations will often create a list of approved or preferred ven-  
dors that have been previously assessed based on capabilities, capacity, and compli-  
ance, have agreed upon pre-set payment processes, and have been incorporated into  
the procurement system. One may also encounter suppliers \(e.g., hotels, convention  
centers, etc.\) that have preferred or exclusive vendors, which may limit an organizer’s  
choices \(or increase costs\) regarding the full scope of the procurement needs and must  
be identified and analyzed when evaluating bids or proposals.  
Develop complete and accurate solicitation briefing documents, which may be  
called by various names and for various purposes as shown in Table 7.6. .  
In order to choose providers based on an equitable selection process, selection cri-  
teria must be determined and should be clearly specified. This criteria may be sub-  
jective or objective, tangible or intangible, and can include, among other things,  
quantity, quality, service, cost, delivery, understanding of need, creative approach,  
reliability, technical capability or support, and terms of purchase \(Monks, 1996; PMI,  
2000\), plus any restrictions or preferences imposed on either the products and serv-  
ices sought or the selection process itself \(Silvers, 2004a\). It is widely recommended  
that selection criteria be assigned numerical importance ratings that will result in a  
quantitative score that eliminates \(or at least lessens\) personal influence or prefer-  
ence in decision making, which facilitates equity and accountability when interpret-  
ing and evaluating bids and proposals. This is often accomplished using a decision  
matrix technique, an exercise based on the multi-attribute utility theory \(MAUT\)  
and sometimes referred to as an analytical hierarchy process \(Yates, 2003\), as shown  
in Figure 7.5. It is also wise to remember that there is a ‘difference between cost and  
value and between simple commodity and complex services’ \(MPI, 2005, p. 14\).  
Contract and contractor management  
Once potential suppliers have been selected \(and references checked\), negotiations  
begin to arrive at agreed upon prices, deliverables, and other expectations, and then  
contracts are executed \(see Chapter 3\). Suppliers bidding on an event should include  
ALL the costs in their bid, but this cannot be taken for granted and must be con-  
firmed during the negotiation and contracting process. Finalize contracts as early as  
possible to facilitate budget control \(Van der Wagen and Carlos, 2005\) and integrate  
these ‘partners’ into the event’s administrative and logistical operations. The event  
organizer might be viewed as a general contractor — managing the integration and  
organization of all the subcontractors \(suppliers\) and securing the appropriate pur-  
chase documentation. These suppliers all have their own administrative practices, Administrative safeguards 177

varying deposit and payment stipulations, and varying lead time and logistical  
requirements. This has significant implications regarding schedule development,  
communications, budget management, and change management.  
Contracts must be tracked to ensure decisions are made and obligations are met in  
accordance with the contractual terms and conditions. Compliance instruments must  
be acquired or issued as necessary, applicable policies and circumstances must be  
communicated, and an effective change control system must be implemented. Formal,  
written change orders requiring signed authorization should always be used \(see  
Appendix H\: Sample change order form\), and this is even more important for any  
changes on-site at an event because these changes are often costly in money, quality,  
and potential risk.  
Quality control procedures should be developed and implemented that verifies the  
products and services delivered satisfy the agreed upon specifications. Performance  
evaluations should be conducted using evaluation criteria that reflect the selection  
criteria and the objectives of the event in order to provide business intelligence for  
future events. Contract closeout and final payments should be completed in compli-  
ance with established contractual requirements and purchasing or payment policies en

and procedures. It is important to remember that donated goods and services, either  
from volunteers or in an in-kind sponsorship context, must meet the same regulatory  
standards and compliance requirements as those purchased in order to limit the  
event’s exposure to liability.  
Systems management  
Systems management covers the implementation and coordination of the various  
accountability, database, knowledge management, and knowledge transfer systems  
using suitable technology applications and equipment to integrate the needs of the  
event project and enterprise \(see Table 7.7\). A system, simply put, is the interrelated  
activities or parts that work together to form a whole or process to perform a task.  
The development and usage of physical and conceptual systems that automate  
recurring and monotonous tasks, delineate methodologies, and standardize proce-  
dures has the advantage of promoting consistency and reducing errors and costs,  
thereby contributing to the ‘effectiveness and efficiency of the organization’ \(Tricker,  
20017 p. 32\)\:  
Identifying and understanding systems  
Identify the types, scope, and complexity of the organizational and technological sys-  
tems employed by the event organization and, where possible, recommend the devel-  
opment or acquisition of systems that will increase productivity and promote risk  
management objectives. A system can be as simple as checking off items on a checklist  
or as extensive as elaborate project management software. It is not the financial invest-  
ment that counts; it’s the ability of the system to provide an orderly and comprehensive  
process that accomplishes the function required.  
Determine whether or not the people using the systems recognize the impact of  
their actions \(or inaction\) on those systems. Weaknesses in the implementation of a  
system are a risk and steps must be taken to either improve the training in the use of  
the system or improve the system itself \(e.g., revision, simplification, replacement\).  
Weaknesses in the integration of systems, a problem when systems are devised \(con-  
ceptual\) or purchased \(technological\) by different people or departments at different  
times, may be overcome by viewing \(and reviewing\) all of the systems together as a  
system itself. Administrative safeguards 179  
As discussed throughout this chapter, establishment of policies, procedures, rules,  
and structures facilitates effective risk management by providing guidance based on  
best practice and the lessons learned from trial and error. An organization that  
embraces systems thinking — understanding the linkages, interactions, and processes  
of systems and system elements — is capable of continuous improvement that will lead  
to increased safety, security, and sustainability.  
Decision making  
One of the critical areas in which development of a system will facilitate effective  
risk management is decision making. This is closely linked to the hierarchies of gov-  
ernance, accountability, and responsibility established when devising the organiza-  
tional chart in order to prevent unsanctioned decision making. The purpose of a  
decision-making system is not to make people have to ask permission to make a  
decision; rather, it is to give them the tools for making good decisions. You want peo-  
ple to take on responsibility and to be able to contribute their experience and expert-  
ise, but you don’t want over-confident or over-emotional vigilantes taking things  
upon themselves without the proper authority, especially in high-risk or crisis situa-  
tions, which may be subject to a strict hierarchy as described in Chapters 5 and 6.  
Nor do you want to over-burden individuals with the sole responsibility for making  
a decision when collaborative deliberation is advisable.  
An effective decision-making system has standardized and sequential processes  
with feedback loops that reveal the choices for and consequences of the decisions to be  
made and includes many of the tools and techniques described in Chapter 2. Yates  
\(2003\) contends that decision making has a structure and delineates the facets of deci-  
sion making as need, mode, investment, options, possibilities, judgment, value, trade-  
offs, acceptability, and implementation. Although intuition should not be discounted  
\(Gladwell, 2005\), with all the elements included in and decisions surrounding an  
event, developing and using a structured decision-making system can help ensure the  
scope and impact of those decisions are well reasoned and justify those decisions to  
clients and constituencies. It can also help one discern and address the difference  
between the ‘urgent’ and the ‘important’ \(a condition extremely prevalent in the high-  
stress atmosphere of meeting and event management\).  
Managing the technology  
Many conceptual systems \(e.g., policies and procedures\) are captured in handbooks,  
checklists, or manuals, but are also supported by and implemented through tech-  
nology \(e.g., databases, networks, communication technologies, and web technol-  
ogy\). The procurement, operations, maintenance, and upgrading of this technology  
must be managed, including the security and integrity of these technological sys-  
tems. The equipment, materials, machinery, suppliers, accessibility, compatibility,  
capability, and reliability should be examined, and any inherent hazards should be  
analyzed and mitigated.  
Office equipment breaks, computers crash, networks go down, and web-based  
tools can be compromised. Exclusive reliance on any single technology leaves admin-  
istrative operations vulnerable. Redundancy and back-ups of all data within systems  
is a must. Equipment must be maintained properly. Computer usage must be gov-  
erned by policies that control access and activities that put the organization and its  
equipment at risk \(e.g., Internet surfing and downloads\). Wireless and networking 180 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
technology must be judiciously studied to ensure business intelligence is secure and  
private information is protected. This should all be incorporated into a security system  
that includes the physical, behavioral, and procedural loss prevention tactics discussed  
in Chapter 5.  
# Summary  
Risk management will entail the investment of time, money, and human resources.  
Without sufficient investment, risk management will not be effective. The amount of  
resources budgeted will vary greatly depending on the size, type, and purpose of the  
event, as well as the host or hosting organization’s objectives and perception of the  
importance of risk management. Meticulous identification of the resources available  
for the event project will determine the allocation of those resources \(or re-allocation  
if necessary\) and the practicality of the project, as well as specify any obstacles and  
the strategies to overcome them. There must be sufficient resources to ensure feasi-  
bility and there must be a balance of resources to mitigate risk.  
Time is a resource that cannot be increased unless the date of the event is flexible.  
Its allotment and arrangement must be efficient and effective, which needs to be  
reflected in and communicated via comprehensive agendas, calendars, and/or time  
maps. From the task definition through the proper sequencing and scheduling of  
those tasks, risk planning and control tactics must be integrated throughout the  
timeline and the production schedule.  
The financial resources of an event must be budgeted carefully. The more limited  
the budget, the more focused one must be on the event goals, but a quality event  
does not depend on a large budget. Budgets must be allocated appropriately based  
on the priorities identified by the needs assessment, and they must be monitored to  
make certain the revenues and expenses are within their projected amounts and cash  
flow is sufficient to cover the expenses in a timely manner.  
Sufficient human resources \(full- or part-time staff, volunteers, or contracted  
labor\) must be recruited. They must be provided with the proper orientation, train-  
ing, and motivation for the jobs they are to accomplish. Their use must be evaluated  
to ensure you have enough of the right people in the right places at the right times  
doing the right jobs. Well-trained, experienced personnel may cost more, but they  
are often more efficient, effective, and risk aware.  
Every element included in the event will have a cost, and practically every event  
element will have options at varying levels of quality and price offered by potential  
suppliers. From planning for procurement through completing and closing out the  
contractual relationships with suppliers after the event, the objective is to select the  
best products and services available to meet the event’s needs within the budget  
allowed. All supplier agreements should be in writing and all changes should be  
acknowledged by all parties in writing on a change order. Finally, all suppliers and  
contractors should be evaluated on their performance so the lessons learned may be  
incorporated into the next event.  
Managing quality, productivity, and proficiency is facilitated by the development  
of systems that reduce errors and produce improvements. Such systems also help  
identity, mitigate, and control risk. Conceptual and technological systems should be  
devised or acquired to make good decision making possible and lessen the possibil-  
ity of mistakes that can jeopardize the procedures and outcomes of the event. ee etn=enenitesesnnnss=pnenanssnenenns tes

# Introduction  
Communication is a vital component of the risk management process and system,  
which includes timely information acquisition and distribution plus the appropriate  
consultation in decision making. It is the critical link between the information sur-  
rounding the event project and the stakeholders involved in the event project. It is  
used to warn, inform, connect with, and advise the various publics \(stakeholders and  
audiences\) of the existence and conditions of the event project and to collect, convey,  
confirm, and publicize information that will guide and influence behavior according  
to the needs of the event and its risk management objectives.  
Communication is a vast yet simple concept wherein there is a transmission of a  
shared understanding between people using a variety of tools and techniques and  
commonly understood language, symbols, and signals. In order to communicate there  
must be a sender, a message, a channel \(i.e., transmission method\), and a receiver, and  
the words and symbols must be recognized and comprehended by both the sender  
and the receiver. In other words, communication is composed of the message, mode,  
and medium, as illustrated in Figure 8.1. It is also important to understand that com-  
munication is a two-way process. Feedback and confirmation systems should always  
be incorporated into the system to ensure the information provided or instructions Communications 185

Communication  
Figure 8.1 The dimensions of communication  
given are understood. A flaw or breakdown in any part of this chain can result in mis-  
communication or missed communications.  
Communications may be written, verbal, audible, or visual and the message  
delivery efficiency and efficacy associated with these communication channels  
\(i.e., formats\) should be considered carefully when deciding which will best serve the  
event project’s information acquisition and distribution needs\:  
e Written word\: memos, reports, manuals, notes, contracts, signs, etc.  
¢ Spoken word\: conversations, telephone calls, meetings, announcements, etc.  
@ Gestures\: expressions, voice tone, actions, etc.  
Multimedia\: a combination of methods, often involving technology.  
Visual images\: illustrations, photographs, charts, etc.  
Symbols\: icons, characters, figures, visual and audible signals, logos, uniforms,  
insignias, etc.  
Many communication experts advise that using several channels of communication to  
deliver a message will enhance interest, retention, and comprehension of that mes-  
sage. Using the written word, the spoken word, and visual aids or images throughout  
the event communications plan should ensure important messages are received and  
properly understood.  
Communication channels must be open, effective, and inclusive, and communica-  
tion blocks must be reduced or eliminated. According to Heller \(1998\) communication  
problems are often due to timing, method, environment \(noise, interruptions, etc.\), or  
emotion \(personality conflicts, hurt feelings, etc.\). Haddow and Bullock \(2003\) propose  
that the blocks to communicating risk include competing demands for attention, com-  
placency, denial, conflicts with existing beliefs, and message and messenger credibility.  
FEMA \(2005\) suggests that the communication variables that may become barriers  
include the difference between sender and receiver \(e.g., attitude, information levels,  
and social systems\), differences in communication styles, differences in previous enn a en near nn mnnnn cnn enema 186 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

experiences, cultural differences, mismatched message and body language, and, of par-  
ticular pertinence to event production staff, stress, change in routine, and lack of sleep.  
These vulnerabilities must be considered when devising the communication plan and  
procedures.  
The typical communication tools used at and for events are shown in Figure 8.2.  
Each tool has multi-functional capabilities within an overall event communications  
plan, from operational purposes \(project management\) to marketing purposes to risk  
management purposes. In addition, each method of communication will have differ-  
ent applications and implications within both the normal functioning of an event and  
a crisis or emergency situation. Some of these issues are shown in Table 8.1.  
Communication is the skill that supports the entire event management process and  
a comprehensive and carefully crafted communications plan is critical to the entire  
risk management process from assessment to control to evaluation. Communication  
skills include the ability to listen to, comprehend, interpret, write, and verbally present  
information in an effective and efficient manner. These skills are used to negotiate, per-  
suade, report, explain, identify relevance and urgency of information, and make logical  
and compelling arguments, as well as recognizing and overcoming ‘wishful listening’  
and other sender and receiver miscommunications. ET CTL LL SSS CL TT LTE CE CS SU ee a

Brochures may be considered a type of contract \(what is promised must be

Reports and meeting minutes are an effective way to monitor project activity in a

Manuals are created to facilitate the communication of standard operating

Urgency and delivery medium \(e.g., fax or e-mail\) does not negate the need for  
good writing, spelling, and grammar  
Verbal messages are quick and interactive but may be forgotten or  
misinterpreted \(Heller, 1998\)  
Anything from a conversation that may have a financial, legal, or operational  
affect on the event or event organization should always be followed up with a  
written memorandum outlining the items discussed  
A PA system should have its own primary and back-up power source and must be  
audible \(adequate volume and clarity\) throughout the event site including inside  
and outside the building, in dressing rooms, toilet facilities, and elevators, and in  
all auxiliary areas such as parking lots and staging areas \(Wertheimer, 1980\)  
Audible announcements must be simple, enunciated clearly, and repeated often  
enough to reach the entire audience as it changes and/or moves through the  
event site \(FEMA, 2005\)  
New fire codes are expected to require audible announcements advising patrons  
of emergency exits at all public assemblies of 50 or more persons  
Variable message signs may be used to provide both marketing information and  
safety announcements or warnings  
Photographs or other illustrative graphics can provide important instructions such  
as egress direction or the way to operate an emergency shutdown mechanism  
Projection devices used within an event program may be used to display  
emergency instructions and reinforce emergency announcements  
Broadcast networks, both radio and television, may be used to publicize event-  
related conditions, and will be critical in a disaster situation; radio and television  
are best for creating awareness and urgency, but print media is best for providing  
detailed information  
The Internet may be used to host event-related Web sites, create chat rooms  
where event stakeholders may hold synchronous or asynchronous discussions, and  
should be used to research external threats and vulnerabilities  
e All electronic communications should be presumed to be public  
e E-mail can be altered and forwarded to unintended audiences without your  
permission  
Cellular telephone calls and two-way radio transmissions should not be presumed  
to be private  
Any e-commerce activities must be conducted through a secure server that  
protects buyer and seller information, particularly credit card information  
Senders have the responsibility for ensuring messages are clear, concise, and  
complete, including selecting the most appropriate message, mode, and medium for  
transmission, and confirming that the message has been understood; receivers are  
responsible for ensuring the messages received are complete and properly understood ——————  
188 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
\(PMI, 2000\). FEMA \(2005\) asserts that in order to make messages clear, they should be  
presented in sequence \(e.g., the reason for the message, supporting information, and  
the conclusions, recommendations, or action required\), use precise wording, and omit  
unnecessary details. In addition, one must know the multi-lingual, multi-cultural,  
multi-modal, and multi-media needs of the intended audience.  
One must also recognize the nonverbal interpersonal communication skills and  
cultural implications related to body language \(kinesics\), eye contact and behavior  
\(occulesics\), personal space \(proxemics\), touching \(haptics\), vocal intonation \(vocal-  
ics\), time usage \(chronemics\), and appearance \(physique, attire, etc.\). Nonverbal cues  
take on much more importance during in-person human interaction, sometimes com-  
prising up to 90 percent of the communication taking place, and will supersede verbal  
messages if not in sync. Use these nonverbal cues to send cohesive messages and inter-  
pret the receiver’s reaction and understanding.  
Communications management  
Communications management encompasses the acquisition of the necessary equip-  
ment and development and implementation of the modes and protocols for on-site  
briefing and debriefing activities and information exchange with internal and exter-  
nal constituents of the event project, including the preparation and incorporation of  
applicable documentation and contact information into a comprehensive and read-  
ily accessible format. Communication strategies must be developed that ensure the  
people involved in the event have the information they need to accomplish their  
jobs, duties, goals, and objectives, and that problems due to miscommunication are  
minimized. The typical communication risks are shown in Table 8.2.  
As noted in Chapter 2, the overall risk management plan includes development of  
the procedures and techniques to be used for communicating activities, actions, and  
outcomes. A communications plan must be devised that incorporates the flow of  
adequate and accurate information through the operational structure of the event's  
internal and external organization throughout the life of the event project. The scope  
and need for rigorous and formalized plans increases as the scale and complexity of  
the organization and/or event increases or compliance requirements are imposed.

Communications 189  
Pre-event communications will be focused on the project management aspects of  
the event operations. A great deal of information must be collected from vendors,  
suppliers, regulatory authorities, and other important stakeholders and influencers  
in order to create effective event management and event risk management plans for  
an event production, as well as collecting and distributing information to monitor  
the progress and performance of task assignments. With all key communications,  
written confirmations of receipt and understanding should be required, particularly  
when related to changes in timing, cost, or quality.  
On-site during the event, the communications plan will be focused on the imme-  
diate transfer of critical information to and from those charged with monitoring  
functions, as well as the transmission of information necessary to the health, safety,  
welfare, and participation of those in attendance at the event. When responding to  
an emergency, the channels of communication used for information exchange dur-  
ing normal operations will be used and expanded to include the appropriate emer-  
gency response agencies and authorities \(Silvers, 2004a\).  
Post-event communications will include debriefings and reports that capture the  
outcomes and lessons learned from the event project, as well as the administrative  
closure of the event operations and obligations. These communications may extend  
to a year-round strategy with certain constituencies, such as maintaining a volunteer  
base for a festival or extending the educational programming for conference atten-  
dees, not to mention the marketing and customer relations strategies associated with  
retaining sponsors and clients.  
Consider this... 8.1  
Air travel changed overnight  
August 10, 2006\: Television news reports announced that a terrorist plan to blow up 10 planes  
headed to the U.S. out of Heathrow airport in the U.K. was thwarted. The plan was for suicide  
bombers as passengers to combine specific liquids while on board to create the explosive  
devices. New security restrictions were instituted immediately throughout the U.S. by the  
Transportation Security Administration \(TSA\) that prohibited virtually all liquids and gels  
from carry-on luggage and other hand-carried items.  
Beth Cooper-Zobott, Director of Conference Services of Equity Residential in Chicago,  
Illinois, was in Sunny Isles, Florida, managing a conference of approximately 75 people that  
was to end that day. As is her habit when traveling, she turned on the news at 6\:15 a.m. to  
check on potential travel delays for her group and heard of the events. The first thing she did  
was go to the TSA Web site to get all of the latest information. She made an announcement at  
the first scheduled gathering of the day about the situation and read what the TSA Web site  
had to say to the group. Because most of the group’s departures from the hotel to the airport  
didn’t begin until 2\:00 p.m., her guests had plenty of time to pack newly prohibited items in  
their checked luggage. Additionally, she was able to obtain ‘live’ information from one of her  
executives who had had a 6\:45 a.m. pick-up and was at the airport by 7\:30 a.m. and called her  
with an update on the security procedures being enforced. She moved up the departure times  
that the ground transportation company had given her by one hour to ensure early arrival for  
security delays. 190 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Despite all this, rumormongering was rampant almost from the start. One woman told Beth  
that she needed to tell the group that they would have to throw away their metal sunglass  
cases because they were no longer allowed. Beth asked her where she learned this and the  
woman said ‘Good Morning America’ \(a popular television program\). Beth told her that the  
information was unconfirmed and that she wouldn’t make announcements unless informa-  
tion was officially posted on the TSA Web site. Another woman said that her husband read  
that the TSA was confiscating automatic car door openers/remotes. Again, Beth told her that  
this information was unconfirmed.  
Beth was able to respond to changing events as they happened because she had a commu-  
nications plan in place that allowed her to get information on external conditions \(turning on  
the news every morning\), acquire accurate information \(going to the TSA Web site\), and add  
‘man on the scene’ information to what she told her group \(the call with her colleague already  
at the airport\). She was also able to counteract rumors and speculation by refusing to report  
unconfirmed and unofficial information, as well as make arrangements to accommodate the  
likely time delays caused by the new restrictions.  
Developing a system for internal and external  
# communications  
A communications system incorporates the communications requirements \(i.e., the  
type and format needed by whom, when, and where\) and the communications tech-  
nology to be used based on those requirements \(PMI, 2000\). Alexander \(2002, p- 168\)  
contends that a communications system must address the four components of the  
communication process.  
° Technology\: the hardware used for the composition and transfer of messages.  
e Procedures\: the formats and methods used with the technology.  
e Human factors\: perceptions and the capability to operate the technology.  
¢ Organizational context\: the framework of rules, cultures, targets, and priorities.  
This quartet is similar to NEPA’s Standard 1221 \(2002, p. 36\), which identifies the  
four basic elements of a communications system as equipment, operating proce-  
dures, personnel training, and the message types, quantity \(system capacity\), con-  
tent, and timing, and goes on to identify ‘common terminology,’ the ‘use of clear text  
or plain language and established standard terms and phrases,’ as a communica-  
tions concept necessary for good system performance. Glaesser \(2006\) advises that  
the agility of the communications system is dependent upon preparation for the  
scope, modes, and mediums necessary.  
It is vital that the communications system be devised as a whole using systems  
thinking as discussed in Chapter 7\: understanding the linkages, interactions, elements,  
and processes of the system. Just as our own circulatory system regulates the flow of  
blood throughout our bodies, so, too, must the communications system ensure that  
the flow of information encompasses all those who have or need information to do  
their jobs properly, efficiently, and effectively. This includes all the internal and exter-  
nal constituencies of the event Project, as shown in Figure 8.3, and different modes of  
communication will often be necessary for these stakeholders and stakeholder groups  
throughout the event project, particularly during the run of an event. 3 Communications 191  
Figure 8.3 Typical internal and external stakeholder constituencies  
Internal stakeholders may include a broad variety of personnel, participants,  
providers, and people with important political influence on the way in which the  
event will be operated. External stakeholders may encompass many of the same types  
of people as internal stakeholders, yet may not need to be included in many opera-  
tional communications \(and sometimes should not be included for security reasons\).  
For example, depending on the type and scope of an event, the client may wish to  
or need to be considered an external stakeholder, such as the mother of the bride for  
a wedding; she doesn’t need to be included in all your communications with the  
suppliers before the event, but will need to be included in any communications  
regarding changes to the event or emergencies. A corporate sponsor of a large festi-  
val, however, may need to be included in the entire event planning and risk assess-  
ment process to ensure its investment in the event will be effective from a marketing  
and liability standpoint \(and may be able to provide valuable perspectives and  
resources to the risk management process\). Certain authorities may need to be  
included as internal stakeholders during pre-event and on-site communications for  
compliance reasons, and some vendors will only need to be advised of changes or  
cancellation after the initial procurement communication has taken place.  
The typical internal and external messages \(types of information to be collected  
and disseminated\) are listed in Table 8.3. Internal messages will likely concentrate  
on operational and monitoring information. External messages will likely be more I

promotional or marketing related, yet will include sufficient operational informa-  
tion and instructions to establish the correct expectations and encourage the proper  
or desired actions and behavior.  
External messages may be targeted at specific constituencies within an external  
group, which may be political, operational, regulatory, or promotional in nature.  
According to Hoyle \(2002, p. 104\), ‘Research into each target market is essential in  
understanding the needs and major areas of interest inherent among them.’ As  
Berlonghi \(1990\) notes, target markets and marketing messages will be important in  
the identification of the expectations and expected behaviors of those who are tar-  
geted as potential attendees for the event as well as those that might be attracted for  
the purposes of disrupting the event.  
Of particular importance will be communicating safety, security, and transporta-  
tion information to event audiences and affected community neighbors, such as  
advising of traffic conditions or closures due to the event’s operations or advising  
event goers regarding prohibited items before they reach the entrance \(so they will  
not bring contraband in the first place\). Wertheimer \(1980\) advises that special notices  
and prohibitions for an event should be publicized well in advance of an event.  
On-site connectivity, command, and control  
The on-site communications plan takes on a more dynamic character as the pace typ-  
ically quickens and the need for efficient informant/decision maker/responder con-  
nections heightens \(HSE, 1999\). Communications between the organizers, staff,  
volunteers, security and stewarding personnel, performers and participants, suppli-  
ers, attendees, authorities, and the media needs a comprehensive and effective net-  
work that provides information that is timely, accurate, and to the point. Action,  
activities, and conditions are continuously monitored, and, as noted in Chapter 2,  
once a corrective action has been decided upon and taken, this must be communi-  
cated to internal and external staff, suppliers, and stakeholders.  
The risk manager should ensure that this network covers all aspects and all areas of  
the event. Procedures must be established for who will transmit information, to whom  
it will be transmitted and how, and in what order and format it will be transmitted. Communications 193

Figure 8.4 Decentralized communications network  
The chain of command and control must be specified, and it is widely recommended  
that a centralized command post be established for communications, security, and  
emergency response efficiency. As illustrated in Figures 8.4 and 8.5, based on a one-  
day fundraising carnival held throughout the grounds of a boarding school, there  
should be communications capability to and from all areas and the joint operations  
center \(JOC\), which is accomplished with numerous radio frequencies or messengers  
\(runners\) to notify each other and the JOC. However, this becomes much more effi-  
cient if all messages come in to the JOC and are then broadcast from the JOC after the  
appropriate analysis and decision making has taken place.  
Designating official spokespersons is also important in order to limit the number of  
individuals transmitting ‘official’ information about an event, particularly in an emer-  
gency situation. The media and other stakeholders should be given one point of con-  
tact during an emergency, and all communications should be funneled through that  
contact. Creating a joint information center \(JIC\), typically within or adjacent to the  
JOC, provides the central point for all information and communication activities to  
coordinate acquisition and release of accurate and consistent information \(Haddow  
and Bullock, 2003\).  
Communication networks should also incorporate alerting strategies for internal  
and external stakeholders, particularly for crisis situations. Establish a flowchart that  
specifies the communication responsibilities according to the audiences or constituen-  
cies affected and the modes and mediums to be used. For example, establishing phone  
trees can facilitate the quick dissemination of information through delegation. 194 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

It may also be advisable to designate an off-site control center location and per-  
sonnel so that external advisories \(incoming and outgoing\) are not dependent upon  
on-site capabilities that might become damaged or overwhelmed in an emergency. A  
security assessment of all the on-site communication systems and equipment should  
be done because, as Berlonghi \(1990\) points out, these will likely be a prime target  
for those wishing to disrupt the event.  
Communications equipment  
A variety of communications equipment is available to meet the on-site communi-  
cation needs of an event, the most common of which is two-way radios \(walkie-  
talkies\) for internal communications and the public address \(PA\) system for public  
communications. All communications equipment should be tested to ensure it is in  
good working order and capable of covering the entire event site. All primary com-  
munications equipment should have its own power supply and a back-up system  
\(e.g., loud hailers for PA announcements\) and/or redundancy.  
The use of common telecommunications equipment such as mobile phones and  
pagers may be a simple way to enhance communication capabilities amongst staff  
and other personnel. When working in a distant locale, pre-paid telephone cards  
may be used to facilitate access to pay telephones or long distance service \(and per-  
haps even control costs\). lt might be advisable to purchase two cellular phones with SSE nee OE coe a ee

afresh’ number and post this number around the venue for attendees to call if they  
\* have or see an emergency or incident \(the second phone serves as the back-up\). It is  
also advised that the event organizer, risk manager, and key staff members program  
emergency contact numbers into their cellular phone address books, and then delete  
- them after the event.  
There are many additional types of equipment used for the production of the event  
\_ program that may also be integrated into the communications planning from a risk  
management perspective, including scoreboards, lighting, sound systems, and projec-  
tion equipment. It is also important to consider the visual and nonverbal forms of  
communications equipment such as uniforms and signage and even hand signals.  
Distinctive uniforms \(e.g., vests, jackets, or T-shirts\) not only indicate authority \(and  
access to event information\) to audience members, it allows these personnel to be  
\_ quickly identified within a crowd by organizers and responders \(HSE, 1999\). The staff  
of one event company, for example, always wore bright, neon pink event jackets that  
were visible in a field with more than 10000 spectators. Pre-determined hand signals  
or gestures can visually communicate specific conditions or messages. For example,  
Berlonghi \(1990\) reports that ushers removing their hat is a common way to signal the  
need for security at their location.  
Signage is an important component of the communications plan as well as site  
management, which will be discussed further in Chapter 11. Informational and  
warning messages should be posted on signage at critical points throughout the  
event site, particularly at entrances when there are restrictions on who or what may  
be brought into the event. Signage is especially important in emergency evacuation  
plans, and must be highly visible and unambiguous \(see Figure 8.6\). Dr. G. Keith  
Still of Crowd Dynamics Limited in the U.K. offers the following perspective on sig-  
nage and communicating with the audience\:  
‘One of the main failings of the many sites we've reviewed is information and communication systems. Poor  
signage not only confuses and frustrates people but, in the event of an emergency, can cause frustration that NY  
196 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
leads to crowd violence. When dealing with an uncontrollable circumstance \(such as the weather\), you do  
control one thing\: how you communicate with the crowd. ‘We are sorry but there is no further information  
at this time’ is an announcement that keeps the management in contact with the crowd. No announcement  
can increase frustration so consider talking to the crowd, keeping people informed of the situation even if  
there is no change in the circumstances.’  
Communications protocols  
Communications protocols include the assignment of radio frequencies or channels  
to be used for various personnel, the types of messages, and the procedures neces-  
sary for maintaining radio discipline. These protocols should also include the deci-  
sion making and accountability hierarchies and the language to be used for internal  
radio messages and external announcements.  
Radios often become a mode for carrying on idle conversations between personnel  
unless specific procedures and codes of behavior are established and enforced. Too  
many people using the same frequency can confuse the system, therefore specific and  
different channels should be assigned to operations and emergency communications,  
and for different departmental teams. Assign response team members with specific  
communication responsibilities, such as one to communicate with authorities, another  
to attendee questions and concerns, and another to liaison with facility management  
and other vendors \(Doyle, 2005\).  
Limits should be placed on nonevent communications and extraneous or emergency  
information, particularly when such transmissions could be heard by the general  
public or specific stakeholders that should not hear what is being said until the message  
has been acted upon. If certain radio conversations need to be restricted to only certain  
personnel, it may be necessary to change channels to a frequency restricted to only  
those personnel, typically accessible only to senior staff.  
The decision-making hierarchy must be clearly established so that unauthorized  
decisions are not acted upon nor are improper instructions given. Specific codes may  
need to be established that authenticate certain messages. Make certain those with  
radios and communication responsibilities understand the chain of command and  
exact notification procedures for different types of incidents.  
Cultural, linguistic, educational, and work background diversity often leads to  
radically different vocabularies, jargon, and perspectives \(Kendrick, 2003\). This  
is why it is important to establish a common lexicon for radio communications,  
particularly when public safety authorities are included in the on-site communi-  
cations plan and protocol. Each public safety agency \(e.g., fire department, police  
department, etc.\) has its own norms, guidelines, and internal culture \(Latoski,  
Dunn, Wagenblast, Randall, and Walker, 2003\), which is why the ‘ten-codes’ \(e.g.,  
10-4" to indicate message received, ‘10-20’ to request one’s location\) are prohibited  
in an official incident command system because their meanings vary from agency to  
agency.  
Voice procedures for good radio discipline should be devised and all radio users  
should receive training to ensure these instructions are properly carried out \(see  
Table 8.4\). Talk groups \(frequency channels\), call signs \(an individual's personal  
radio identification name or title\), radio call process \(how to make, receive, and end  
a call\), and terminology \(words or codes to be used\) should be clearly specified and  
adhered to \(see Appendix I\: Radio protocol\). SSeS SSS Ss is SSNS

Channel usage  
Each person with a radio should have a unique identification  
designation that is descriptive of the position/location/station or specific  
talk group  
Use of personal names is not advised for large networks  
Call signs typically have a word and a number or letter designation \(e.g.,  
‘Exhibit Hall Delta’\)  
Letter designations for call signs and for spelling out words should  
conform to the International Phonetic Alphabet \(Appendix |\: Radio  
protocol\)  
Pronunciations should be distinctly different \(‘Base’ and ‘Gate’ or ‘Race’  
would be incompatible call signs\)  
All transmissions should be identified with call signs or caller and  
intended receiver identification  
All calis should be punctuated with ‘Over’ to indicate end of a  
transmission and ‘Out’ to indicate end of a conversation and the  
channel is free for others to use  
Specify the order in which the caller and receiver should be identified,  
e.g., caller first, followed by receiver\: ‘This is \[sender's call sign\] to  
\[target receiver's call sign\]. Over’  
If there is no response, let others know the channel is clear for the next  
user, e.g., ‘Nothing heard; \[sender call sign\] Out’  
Receiver should acknowledge a call and the caller, e.g., ‘This is  
\[receiver's call sign\]. Go ahead \[sender's call sign\]. Over’  
Terminology and standards should be established for transmitting  
different kinds of information  
¢ Messages should be brief, simple, and direct using clear language  
© Code numbers or words may be necessary for quick and/or protected  
communications \(e.g., ‘10-13’ or ‘Code Blue’ for an emergency,  
‘10-25’ or ‘Relocate’ to indicate the need to move out of hearing range  
of others\)  
Have a specific code that will activate immediate response by security  
personnel  
Ten-codes should only be developed for event-specific users and  
abandoned if public safety responders become involved  
Procedures should be established for verifying that messages have been  
received, understood, and acted upon  
e Personal messages or chatter should be prohibited  
¢ Profanity and indecent or obscene language must be prohibited  
¢ Most two-way radios have numerous frequency channels  
e Channels should be designated according to talk groups and/or message  
types \(e.g., even channels for patrols, odd channels for emergency  
communications\)  
Establish protocol for channel switching \(i.e., under what circumstances  
and a pre-designated pattern\)  
Vendors using their own radios should be advised of available  
frequency allocations that will not conflict with the event channels  
Radio coverage must be checked to ensure frequency channels are  
operable throughout the event site  
Perform an all-radio check-in at the beginning of each shift done ina  
pre-designated order \(e.g., alphabetically\) 198 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

Radio protocols  
During the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City there were more than 6000 radio users  
on the communications network, which required specific radio protocol and procedures in order  
to manage this large number of users. Each talk group was assigned a channel for those users  
with whom a member needed direct contact in order to perform his or her job. Each user was  
assigned a call sign that was descriptive of the person’s position within that group, and users  
were instructed not to use personal names when initiating radio calls. Users were also advised  
that many people would be listening to their conversations, including users located near the  
public or the press, so they needed to be sensitive about the information they were discussing.  
Source\: SLOC \(2000\)  
The PA system, particularly at large spectator events such as sports events and out-  
door events such as festivals, will likely be used for general event information and  
welfare announcements throughout the duration of the event. There must be a distinct  
difference between these regular announcements and emergency announcements  
delivered over the PA system. Certain emergency messages should be delivered via  
a code word or phrase so as not to cause undue audience stress or panic, yet allow staff  
to prepare for response activities. \(Review the crisis communications section in  
Chapter 6 and the warning message attributes in Table 6.12.\)  
Smaller events that have a sound system for the entertainment often plan to use  
that sound system for emergency announcements, and most public assembly venues  
have a house sound system that serves as a PA system. It is important to ensure that  
the entertainers are fully informed and willing to cooperate regarding use of their  
sound system, and there must be a way to override that sound system with the  
house \(or other\) PA system if the entertainers are unable or unwilling to cooperate,  
and if the house PA system is the primary emergency notification system.  
Support documents and documentation  
Numerous documents acquired throughout the planning process may need to be  
available on-site in order to facilitate decision making and communications. Most  
event organizers create a production book \(also called a specifications guide or oper-  
ations manual\) that includes contracts, plans, meeting minutes, correspondence,  
and copies of permits, licenses, or approvals that may become necessary to confirm  
authority and/or instructions.  
Maps, site plans, technical diagrams, flowcharts, and other visual aids should be  
developed or acquired to enhance communications, and these should be available  
on-site. As discussed with radio protocols, agreed-to naming conventions \(i.e.,  
unique reference labels\) should be established to eliminate confusion regarding loca-  
tions, positions, and levels of urgency, which should be consistent on all documents  
and in all communication procedures \(HSE, 1999\).  
Creation and distribution of a standard operations contact list and an emergency  
contact list should be standard operating procedure \(see Appendix J\: Sample contact  
list\). The event organizer should have all pertinent contact names and numbers of all LL Sesser sis SSE  
Communications 199  
key staff, stakeholders, and vendors in the production book, and a specific list of emer-  
gency response contact information should be included as a separate document that is  
quickly accessible at all points of communication such as information booths and reg-  
istration areas. All key personnel with emergency response duties should have a copy,  
and all personnel issued communications equipment such as radios should have a list  
of external contact numbers and internal call signs on a small portable card.  
For some events, such as meetings or expositions, the delegate, exhibitor, or partici-  
pants may be asked to provide an ‘in case of emergency’ \(ICE\) contact name and num-  
ber on their registration form, and these numbers will be maintained in the event's  
registration database and perhaps even printed on the back of the individual’s badge or  
credential. Note, however, that in some jurisdictions, Germany for example, it is illegal  
to require such information due to privacy laws, but it certainly may be a voluntary  
practice. These numbers should be properly removed from all event records after the  
event.  
All on-site briefings and debriefings, monitoring and response activities, and com-  
munications should be documented. This may be accomplished using a variety of tools  
and techniques including, among other things, agendas, incident report forms, incident  
registers, activity logs, message logs, status boards, and videotape from closed circuit  
televisions. This documentation should include and illustrate the sequential aspects of  
these activities, conditions, and decisions so that this intelligence may be incorporated  
into future planning and risk assessments \(as well as evidentiary material\).  
Information management  
Information management encompasses the acquisition, distribution, control, and  
retention of information through the implementation of customary reporting, record  
keeping, and protection procedures for privacy and proprietary information in order  
to ensure the necessary business intelligence and institutional memory is captured  
and preserved. Information management facilitates knowledge management; data  
does not become knowledge until it is captured, comprehended, and capable of being  
transmitted.  
There are vast quantities of information involved in a single event project and for  
the event organization’s general operations, ranging from all the planning docu-  
mentation to the attendee and personnel databases to the communications through-  
out the project and more. All this data must be managed or it will slip away \(one  
individual simply cannot remember everything\), be lost by mistake or malfunction,  
or be compromised due to intent or error. Table 8.5 lists some of the typical risks  
associated with managing the information assets of an event organization.  
Kennedy \(2006\) reminds us that confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the  
foundation for effective and secure data systems. Strategies, policies, and procedures  
should be developed for acquiring and organizing information, and training must be  
provided to ensure that those with data management responsibilities are able to prop-  
erly collect, organize, store, and protect that information in a comprehensive and effi-  
cient manner. Whether the event is massive and complex or small with only a few  
people involved in its planning and production, one must remember the Big Truck  
Theory... what happens if you get run over by a big truck \(metaphorically speaking\)?  
What data will vanish with you \(or your laptop\)? How long would it take to recon-  
struct all the lost information? Will the event project even be able to proceed? TS

Information acquisition, distribution,  
monitoring, and reporting  
Getting and giving information \(the loop of communication\) requires recognition of  
the ways in which one captures, assembles, and otherwise obtains pertinent data  
and information from various internal and external sources. Data, documents, and  
other documentation comes into the event project through a broad spectrum of por-  
tals and throughout the entire planning and production process. Some of these are  
listed in Table 8.6 \(also review Tables 2.3, 2.8, 3.2, and 3.8\).  
Research is conducted and historical records are reviewed in the initial planning  
phases, particularly during the risk assessment, as well as when changes occur in the  
plans or conditions surrounding the event project. Monitoring activities also generate  
important data, which must be processed in the appropriate written and/or comput-  
erized formats, and should be supported with established data reporting and monitor-  
ing systems that are integrated into the communications plan. Intelligence gathering  
activities, such as monitoring external conditions, or the tracking of attendance, lead  
retrieval systems, or continuing education units must be captured and incorporated  
into an agreed-upon data management architecture. a

Figure 8.7. The facets of information systems  
Once captured, all information and data must be analyzed, interpreted, and evalu-  
ated for relevance and accuracy. These information-handling activities include, among  
other things, summarizing, prioritizing, collating, validating, and logging \(Crown, the,  
2005a\). Information distribution policies and procedures, as well as the structure and  
system, should be developed that directs and delivers the information to the right  
people in the appropriate oral, written, and other methods, as well as generates the doc-  
umentation that provides the evidentiary and historical records. O’Toole and Mikolaitis  
\(2002\) emphasize that this architecture and process must be simple, scalable, and, if  
possible, automatically integrated throughout the project management system.  
Data organization system  
The information management architecture must be able to receive, arrange, and pre-  
serve data in a manner that allows that data to be retrieved and protected as needed.  
Here again, systems thinking is required — linkages, interactions, elements, and  
processes — as illustrated in Figure 8.7. Although many event organizations have  
some procedures in place and utilize some form of computer software for these func-  
tions, it is wise to review the system as a whole to identify gaps and vulnerabilities,  
as well as opportunities for improvements.  
Developing an appropriate structure for organizing information relies on being  
able to categorize that information into meaningful clusters that recognizes and illus-  
trates the relationship between the part and the whole \(Kwasnik, 1999\) and identifies  
the proper place to put it. These classifications should acknowledge the type of data,  
its uses, and its context. For example, Kennedy \(2006\) suggests that, for the purposes  
of security, data classification levels of sensitive, personal, and mission critical should  
be used. However, this does not completely reflect the functional requirements of who,  
what, where, when, why, and how information is used throughout the scope of the event  
project, which might suggest that contextual categories based on the administrative a  
202 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
or operational organizational structure \(e.g., committees, departments, tasks, compo-  
nents, etc.\) would be an effective strategy. Filing systems and databases may be based  
on alphabetical, chronological, geographical, numerical, or topical hierarchies. Essex  
\(2006\) contends, however, that the workflow process should shape the system. The  
key to an effective classification system, as Kwasnik \(1999\) asserts, is easily identifiable  
criteria that reflects the needs of its users.  
Standardized documentation, document design, and record keeping policies and  
procedures \(e.g., date stamping, naming conventions, and database sort fields\)  
should be established and implemented in a consistent manner to ensure economi-  
cal and effective filing and retrieval. Standardization increases efficiency, reduces  
errors, and reduces training needs. It may be worthwhile to conduct a functional  
analysis of all the documents and documentation used in the event organization to  
determine the extent of integration \(e.g., cross referencing\) appropriate for the scope  
of documentation. For example, various database systems offer the functionality to  
generate reports throughout the life cycle of an event project, as well as reduce and  
consolidate data entry tasks \(e.g., relational databases\).  
It is also advisable to explore the alternative uses for various types of information  
in the risk management context. As illustrated in the hepatitis story in Chapter 4, for  
example, the database of registered attendees was used to quickly notify the entire  
attendee population of the potential health threat. The preparation of manifests or  
use of sign-in sheets may facilitate the location of personnel deployed at an event site  
or account for missing persons in the event of a disaster. A high volume of pre-event.  
or on-site inquiries might indicate the need for additional signage or informational  
announcements. Accurate attendance counts can prevent over-charging by the cater-  
ing department or exceeding room occupancy capacity in conference sessions.  
Information protection and control  
The broad range of information management technology and systems available to the  
event organization, from the humble filing cabinet to fully integrated web-based  
databases and intranets, offers countless opportunities for efficient and flexible infor-  
mation acquisition, distribution, and retention. However, they also present countless  
vulnerabilities that must be overcome. Policies and procedures must be established  
that maintain the information system security and integrity. Berlonghi \(1996\) advo-  
cates the creation of a confidential information policy and plan that includes the clear  
definition of what shall be considered confidential information, a nomenclature to be  
placed on all documents, access and distribution criteria, restricted and secure stor-  
age locations, third party confidentiality agreements, and enforcement measures.  
Unauthorized access can expose sensitive or ‘mission critical’ information to theft  
or tampering. Access control methods should be devised that restrict access using  
permission-granting procedures and special access codes, which should be changed  
periodically and protected. Special care must be taken when wireless technology is  
used as well. It is advisable to create \(and periodically review\) an inventory of infor-  
mation that is critical to the event operations and/or proprietary in nature, and pro-  
hibit its storage on any portable device \(Kennedy, 2006\).  
As discussed in Chapter 3, identity theft and privacy invasion has become a pri-  
mary concern, and nearly all countries have established privacy and data protection  
legislation that reflects the Principles for Computerized Data Files adopted by the  
United Nations General Assembly on December 14, 1990. These principles include  
among other things, that personal data should be a eS  
Communications 203  
obtained fairly and lawfully \(e.g., informed consent\);  
used only for the purpose specified;  
adequate, relevant, and not excessive to the purpose specified;  
not kept longer than is necessary for the purpose specified;  
destroyed after its purpose is completed; and  
protected from unauthorized access and fraudulent misuse, modification, or  
disclosure.  
In addition, because this legislation varies in its scope and enforcement mechanisms  
throughout the world, many countries include conditions regarding transborder  
data flows, which often include restrictions according to comparable and reciprocal  
safeguards \(Privacy International, 1998\). This might have a significant impact on  
meetings and events held in or attracting attendees from international locations.  
Considering the volume and potential abuses of personal data residing in member,  
employee, attendee, and electronic commerce databases, event organizations that col-  
lect and/or retain personal information should establish and institute explicit policies  
and procedures on how personal information shall be managed \(i.e., type of informa-  
tion, purpose, collection method, storage method, uses, access, disclosure, and dis-  
posal\). The policies should be made available to interested or affected persons, and the  
procedures should be closely monitored. Again, it is important to make certain those  
| who have access permission and data entry responsibilities receive the proper training.  
Data handling procedures for sensitive data \(e.g., health or financial information\)  
. and confidential information \(e.g., VIP arrival manifests\) are particularly important.  
These procedures might include encryption requirements for collecting and transmit-  
ting payment transactions, registrations, or rooming lists with credit card authoriza-  
tions; collection methods and access to data on medical conditions or health-related  
- accommodation needs; and strict limitations on where such data may and may not be  
\_ stored \(e.g., not on laptop computers\). Disposal procedures for data and documents  
' should also be considered, including how and when data will be removed from elec-  
tronic databases and how waste materials containing confidential information will be  
removed and/or destroyed \(e.g., shredding\). These procedures should be conformed  
to by all vendors or suppliers with access to this information \(ICCA/COPE, 2005\).  
Information retention and preservation  
The information management system serves as a knowledge repository. As such it  
must ensure that the data used to conduct the business of the event project and event  
organization is preserved through proper record keeping, backup procedures, and  
archiving, and employing the appropriate data and media storage technology.  
Record keeping may be governed by internal policies and governmental regulations  
that dictate how long and in what format information must be retained. These might  
include financial records, membership records, legal documents, employee records,  
and numerous other written and computerized records. An inventory should be  
conducted to identify the scope and requirements for all documentation.  
Records preservation should be considered from a business continuity as well as  
the compliance perspective. Vital records, which could contain sensitive or classified  
information, must be protected in the event of an emergency or disaster to ensure  
the event business and the business of the event can continue uninterrupted, or at  
least recover. Vital records include ‘Rights and Interest’ records that are needed to  
protect an organization’s essential legal and financial functions and activities, and i  
204 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
the legal and financial rights of individuals directly affected by the organization.  
These include\:  
¢ Banking and investment information \(account numbers, types of accounts, contact  
names\)  
¢ Contracts, agreements, and other contractual obligations  
¢ Employment records \(payroll, leave, social security, retirement\)  
e Financial records \(accounts receivable and accounts payable records, tax records\)  
e Insurance records \(policies, equipment inventories, appraisals\)  
e Proofs of ownership \(leases, titles, deeds\).  
The location of data and records must also be identified. Data may be spread across  
desktop computers, laptops, electronic devices, and removable media \(e.g., thumb  
drives, CDs, PDAs, etc.\) and unless replicated in a centralized location \(e.g., a net-  
work server\) the loss, theft, or damage of that particular piece of technology means  
that data is gone. Routine and comprehensive backups of all electronic data should be  
employed as a standard preventative maintenance practice, including and particu-  
larly for portable devices used by teleworkers. Numerous web-based backup services  
are available as well as devices that may be used in-house. Copies of all electronic  
records \(backups\) and critical documents should be made and stored in a secure off-  
site location.  
Stakeholder management  
A stakeholder is an individual or organization that is financially, politically, emotion-  
ally, contractually, or personally invested in an event. Stakeholders include those  
actively involved in the event project, those who exert influence over it, and those  
whose interests may be affected by it \(PMI, 2000\). Typical event stakeholders are  
shown in Table 8.7. These constituents and constituencies, or target publics \(Masterman  
and Wood, 2006\), may be internal or external, active or dormant, supportive or adver-  
sarial, demanding or docile, champions or challengers, but they will all and always  
have specific interests, expectations, and requirements. It is incumbent upon the event  
organizer and organization to identify, analyze, classify, and manage the relationships  
with these varied stakeholder constituencies through engagement and communica-  
tions to develop a mutual vision of and commitment to the requirements and desired  
outcomes for the event project.  
Stakeholder management should seek to recognize and communicate with the vari-  
ous explicit, implicit, voluntary, and nonvoluntary constituencies of the event project to  
achieve advantageous and ethical outcomes, as exemplified in the Clarkson Principles  
of Stakeholder Management, which were devised through the Redefining the  
Corporation Project as a guide to corporate social responsibility in a global context  
\(Clarkson Centre for Business Ethics, 1999\)

‘Stakeholder analysis  
Conducting a thorough stakeholder analysis provides event organizers with a clear  
\_ picture of the role and scope of stakeholders in an event project and the strategies for  
effective communications with them. This analysis should accomplish the following\:  
'e Identify and categorize stakeholders and stakeholder groups.  
e Identify key stakeholders and critical stakeholder groups.  
© Determine stakeholder roles and desired support and the resultant obligations.  
¢ Measure the stakeholder’s influence.  
e Prioritize stakeholders according to power, influence, and interest.  
Identify linkages between stakeholder groups.  
The stakeholder analysis examines many different aspects of the nature of the stake-  
holders including their potential for cooperation or opposition, their span of influence,  
the issues they care about, whether or not their cooperation or involvement is required,  
whether preemptive or defensive strategies should be taken with them, and what com-  
munication methods and messages should be employed \(see Appendix L\: Stakeholder  
analysis worksheet\).  
Identify internal and external stakeholders and constituencies by examining all  
those individuals, entities, and organizations that have a role in or potential impact  
on the event project. This may take some probing and brainstorming to define the  
possible impacts of and on various stakeholders and the ‘stakes’ \(i.e., financial, polit-  
ical or emotional interest, ownership share, or legal or moral rights\) each stake-  
holder or constituency has. Some stakeholders may not view themselves as such  
until some aspect of the event has a negative impact on them, such as residents in a  
neighborhood adjacent to the event site that has become inaccessible due to the high  
volume of traffic. Some stakeholder groups may not become apparent until attention cei ie i eT  
206 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
is focused on the political aspects of an event element, such as activists protesting  
against a controversial topic or speaker at a conference or the use of animals as enter-  
tainment at a fair.  
\(oy akile \(=\) an dal Sens Be;  
Fair goers’ parking disrupts neighborhood life  
The New Mexico State Fair is held each September and attracts hundreds of thousands of people  
every day of its 17-day run of entertainment, concerts, competitions, rodeos, carnival rides,  
games, farm animals, horses, and agricultural and art exhibits. It is held on a 236-acre fair-  
ground that was on the outskirts of town when built but is now in the center of the city sur-  
rounded by residential neighborhoods and businesses. This raised numerous quality-of-life  
issues for the fairgrounds’ neighbors. In addition to the frustrations of trying to get home  
through the gridlocked traffic during the fair, neighborhood residents also found their streets,  
driveways, and even lawns crammed with parked cars because fair goers tried to find a  
cheaper \(and quicker\) alternative to the jam-packed parking lots on the fairgrounds.  
The residents formed a neighborhood association and forced the city to prohibit fair parking  
on residential side streets, and to enforce that ordinance with constant police patrols that would  
have any unauthorized vehicle towed to their impound lot, which would cost the offender  
US\$100 to retrieve his or her vehicle. Residents are provided with vehicle stickers that indicate  
authorization to park in the neighborhood throughout the duration of the fair, including suffi-  
cient stickers for the vehicles of their visitors and personal guests. The neighborhood associa-  
tion and the fairgrounds now work together to identify any events held at the venue \(e.g.,  
concerts, sporting events, and other fairs and festivals\) that would impact the residents and to  
develop restrictions and procedures to mitigate negative effects each event might have on the  
neighborhood.  
Stakeholders should be categorized according to whose support and involvement  
or lack thereof might have an effect on the success of the event project or the event  
organization’s ability to produce the event. Primary \(or key\) stakeholders are those  
with a direct stake in the event, are often immediate internal and external communi-  
ties of interest, and those that are both influential \(degree of power or control\) and  
important \(extent of impact\). Secondary stakeholders are those witha public or special  
interest stake in the project, those with either influence or importance, and often inter-  
mediaries that become involved if the project passes a certain threshold of significance.  
A threat assessment should be conducted to determine the validity, power, and  
urgency of each stakeholder or stakeholder group and the opportunities and challenges  
each presents. Identify their level of financial or emotional interest in the event project  
\(validity\); their capacity for influencing the event and its outcomes in positive or nega-  
tive ways \(power\); and their issues, priorities, potential for cooperation or opposition,  
and the immediacy of these \(urgency\). A threat requires three things\: the motivation to  
act, the opportunity to act, and the resources to act. Eliminating any one of these three  
factors neutralizes the threat. Conversely, an opportunity requires the same three fac-  
tors, which, when enabled, may facilitate the ability to take advantage of that potential  
benefit. Level of engagement and commitment should also be considered. The level of Sees ee a Oe.

Communication plays a big part in overcoming these risk factors through acknowl-  
edging and informing constituencies, as well as forming, changing, and reinforcing  
attitudes using proactive public relations tactics aimed at altering negative percep-  
tions and improving understanding \(Masterman and Wood, 2006\). A communications  
strategy should be developed that recognizes and integrates the varied interests and  
goals of stakeholders, acknowledges and monitors their concerns and capabilities, and  
engages and actively involves stakeholders in the success of the event project.  
A strategy for obtaining or enhancing support and neutralizing opposition should  
be developed by defining the information each constituency needs and its recom-  
mended level of involvement \(MSH and UNICEF, 1998\). Typical assessment matrix  
tools are often used to prioritize and indicate communication strategies for varying  
stakeholder levels and attitudes, as illustrated in Figure 8.8. In addition, O’Toole  
\(2006a\) advises creating an action matrix that indicates when communications should  
take place during the phases of the event project \(i.e., initiation, planning, implemen-  
tation, the event, and closure\).  
O'Toole \(2006a\) also recommends creating an overview chart that itemizes the  
stakeholders and the event elements to show the areas of concern for each stake-  
holder \(typical issues are shown in Table 8.8\). This overview can be very helpful in  
recognizing relationships between stakeholders that may indicate conflicts of interest  
or enable coalitions for cooperation or opposition to be formed. It is imperative that  
stakeholder analyses be redone whenever a significant change takes place because i

new stakeholders or stakeholder groups may have been added, which may mean there  
are new threats \(or opportunities\) regarding concerns, causes, clashes, and coalitions.  
No event takes place in a vacuum; there are always people interested in what, how,  
and why the event is being held for personal, political, and professional reasons.  
Whether their interest becomes an asset or an impediment depends upon your recog-  
nition of and interactions with them. Strive to see things from their point of view and  
use good communication skills and strategies to build understanding and coopera-  
tion, and, where necessary, to minimize threats.  
# Summary  
Effective communication is the foundation of all event management and event risk  
management functions. Getting the right information from and to the right people at  
the right time and place is paramount to the successful operation and management  
of an event, and particularly critical in any emergency or crisis situation. A commu-  
nications plan should be crafted that includes the entire spectrum of event planning  
and operations, from the initial development stages through the close-out and eval-  
uation phase, with special attention focused on the dynamic communication needs  
during the actual run of the event when the acquisition and distribution of informa-  
tion will be crucial to effective risk monitoring and controlling functions.  
Communications encompasses information acquisition and distribution, and  
‘intention’ is at the core of all communication. From internal communications within  
the event organization to external communications with clients, sponsors, municipal ee a rrr  
Communications 209  
officials and others, the key is clarity of intention regarding the desired responses  
and understanding from the receivers. In order to avoid miscommunication, a vari-  
ety of written, verbal, and visual communication techniques must be used, delivered  
in a timely manner, in a location where there are the fewest distractions, and in an  
atmosphere of trust.  
The success of an event often depends on the timely and proper management of  
the volumes of information surrounding the event. From proposals to contracts to  
status reports to the production book or operations manual \(often referred to as the  
‘event bible’\), the acquisition and distribution of information must be carefully  
planned. Information is an asset, provides visibility, promotes cooperation, allows  
you to track and control risk, and it must be protected from abuse or misuse. Data  
protection is both an obligation and a sound business practice.  
It is vital to remember that stakeholder management deals with the engagement  
of and interactions with the varied stakeholder constituencies of the event, including  
clients, committees, officials, authorities, sponsors, participants, providers, and others  
to develop a mutual vision of and commitment to the requirements and desired  
outcomes for the event project. These varied constituencies often have different per-  
spectives and priorities, and their differing needs must be integrated into the  
communications plan to ensure these do not conflict with, but instead support the  
risk management plans devised for the event project.  
Key safeguards  
¢ Assess the communication skills of those with communication roles and responsibil-  
ities \(including your own\) and seek systems and training to improve potential gaps.  
e Identify and implement a mix of high-tech and low-tech mediums as appropriate  
for the message content, context, and intended recipients.  
e Ensure interoperability and redundancy for communications systems and  
equipment.  
¢ Create an information management system that facilitates retrieval yet protects data.  
e Make certain the backup system encompasses all important data in all locations  
that it is kept.  
e Listen to and build rapport with stakeholders and constituencies.  
¢ Develop plans for acquiring strategic economic and political alliances.

# Introduction  
Marketing is an important facet of overall meeting and event management because the  
event will not be successful or sustainable unless there are attendees. Many events  
have a distinct marketplace character \(e.g., trade shows, arts and crafts fairs\).  
Sponsorship of existing events and specially created events is becoming a key element  
in marketing campaigns for large corporations and small businesses around the world  
in an effort to take advantage of their exciting and experiential nature. Although this  
chapter goes into some depth on marketing theory and techniques, it does not claim to  
replace other texts that cover how to market an event or use events as a marketing tool.  
Its aim is to examine the vulnerabilities associated with marketing activities that the  
risk manager should be aware of, some of which are shown in Table 9.1, and how to  
work in conjunction with those performing the marketing functions to reduce risk.  
Marketing should be, and often is, referred to as ‘sales and marketing’ because there  
is more to marketing than simply promoting a product to induce a sales transaction  
between buyer and seller. Marketing encompasses the range of functions that facilitate  
business development, cultivate economic and political support, and shape the image  
and value of the event project, and the placement of this chapter following the chapter  
on communications is deliberate because all these functions are communication func-  
tions. Masterman and Wood \(2006\) recognized this, asserting that organizational  
image has an effect on the products offered and the ability to sell those products, and  
contend that one must use an integrated marketing communications strategy that puts  
the traditional promotional mix \(the four Ps\: product, price, place, and promotion\) ec a

into a broader and synergistic context, thereby increasing the achievement of short-  
and long-term objectives.  
Kotler, Bowen, and Makens \(1996, p. 12\) define marketing as ‘human activity  
directed at satisfying needs and wants through exchange processes.’ Middleton with  
Clarke \(2001, p. 19\) define it as ‘the process of achieving voluntary exchanges between  
two parties’ \(the buyer and the seller\) and the decision processes that lead to this trans-  
action. Getz \(1997, p. 250\) defines it as ‘the process of employing the marketing mix to  
attain organizational goals through creating value for clients and customer.’ Briggs  
\(2001, p. 42\) asserts that marketing is ‘a process, rather than a series of scattered and  
isolated activities.’  
Marketing, therefore, must be viewed and approached as an interrelated, dynamic,  
and continual process — one that is broader than the sales transaction itself. It must rec-  
ognize the relationship between the buyer, the seller, the product, and the continuous  
interactions and decisions that must take place in order for the transaction to occur, as  
reflected in Figure 9.1. Risk is inherent throughout this continuum unless clarity is  
achieved in defining the customer, his or her needs and desires, the product that will  
satisfy those needs and desires, and the ways in which to reach that customer so that  
the sales objectives of the event organization are achieved. The very feasibility of the  
event is contingent upon this comprehensive and holistic understanding, and the suc-  
cess or failure of the event will depend upon using the appropriate tools, techniques,  
and tactics to meet the needs and objectives of both the buyer and the seller.  
In addition, the nature of the event as an ‘experience’ necessitates a thorough under-  
standing of the unique buyer-seller relationship associated with what is, in reality, an  
intangible product. Masterman and Wood \(2006\) note that, with events, the buyer as an  
attendee becomes part of and adds value to the product \(ie., the experience\), which  
adds further impetus to define and analyze the attitudes, perceptions, and decision  
making processes of customers and event producers to ensure that the interactive com-  
munications are taking place at the right time and in the right ways.  
Marketing plan  
The marketing plan is the formal expression of the integrated process system illus-  
trated in Figure 9.1, and from a risk manager’s perspective it becomes an important 214 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

tool in the risk assessment process. A marketing plan encompasses the overall mar-  
keting strategy and tactics to be employed, including target customer definition,  
acquisition and retention, the internal and external messages and mediums, and the  
maintenance of positive customer or guest relations to achieve the marketing aspi-  
rations for the event project and its hosting organization. The process system  
includes market research, strategy development, campaign planning, communica-  
tion activity definition, and evaluation, monitoring, and corrective actions as appro-  
priate \(Middleton with Clarke, 2001\).  
A written plan is essential to illustrate the nature of the customer \(i.e., the atten-  
dees\), their expectations and expected behaviors, and the status of overall organiza-  
tional readiness to address and deliver on these expectations \(Berlonghi, 1990\).  
A non-existent, incomplete, or fragmented plan is not only difficult to monitor and  
measure, it will reduce the ability to take advantage of opportunities and respond to  
emerging market conditions or threats \(Masterman and Wood, 2006\).  
Ulrich Wiinsch, Lecturer for Event Management at the International University of  
Applied Science, Bad Honnef-Bonn, Germany, offers the following advice on how to  
reduce risk in marketing plans\:  
¢ Spend enough time on assessing goals and objectives and take at least two rounds  
in assessing them — there is often a goal behind a goal.  
¢ Get all stakeholders involved and look into satisfying their different needs.  
¢ Take communication seriously; communication is about understanding, not about  
saying something and assuming the other would know what you meant. en ere rr eeeeeereemcemememnearinecseinesiisnnns sesame  
Marketing issues 215  
e Monitoring along the process according to the project plan is essential and fine-  
tuning your marketing accordingly as well.  
e Find the right story and tell that story in clear words through all your marketing  
material to create a concise image.  
¢ Look out for the sponsoring fit so that your marketing and the marketing of spon-  
sors coincide time-wise and message-wise.  
¢ Plan and reassess and plan and check and produce and get feedback and do and  
reflect — even under the typical time pressure and stress of events.  
e Financial expectations are as serious as non-financial expectations; they need to be  
met along clearly set lines so that all parties involved can rely on an objective and  
agreed assessment.  
e Do not trust your own belly, instinct, intuition \(or whatever\) solely and do not trust  
any other belly solely; finding the right magic takes research and verification to  
identify the crucial issues — creativity and artistry is 90 percent solid craftsmanship.  
The development of the marketing plan consists of the situation analysis, target mar-  
ket definition, message and branding development, marketing medium selection,  
and marketing strategy integration. The situation analysis, described by Getz \(1997,  
p. 255\) as the ‘factors affecting demand and the organization,’ is the starting point of  
determining feasibility in which the environmental, competitive, and opportunity  
aspects of the marketplace are scanned and an appraisal of the proposed or existing  
product or service \(the event\) is conducted. Are there sufficient hotel rooms adjacent  
to the convention center to accommodate a convention of this size? Is the market  
over-saturated with fund raising galas competing for the same patrons? Could this  
community arts festival increase tourism during this traditionally slow season? If we  
decide to proceed, what are our unique selling points, what objectives should we set,  
and what measurements will we use to indicate success?  
Target market definition and segmentation  
Linked closely with the situation analysis is target market definition wherein the  
scope of the internal and external markets are identified and segmented; the charac-  
teristics of primary, secondary, and tertiary market segments are analyzed, the target  
market needs, wants, and expectations are defined; and effective customer relations  
strategies and tactics are determined. Kotler et al. \(1996, p. 20\) defines a market as ‘a  
set of actual and potential buyers who might transact with a seller’ and this defini-  
tion should be compared to that of a stakeholder in order to recognize the scope and  
nature of internal and external ‘customers.’  
Segmentation helps identify, qualify, and prioritize target markets \(Hoyle, 2002\) and  
facilitates the development of the appropriate product features and benefits that will  
meet needs and desires, as well as the selecting messages and mediums for reaching  
the various segments. Segmentation creates a customer profile using different vari-  
ables, as shown in Table 9.2, and this market intelligence may reveal market, product,  
or promotion strategy weaknesses as well as new market opportunities. The charac-  
teristics associated with these variables will also help identify consumer expectations  
and expected behaviors when conducting risk assessment activities \(e.g., identifying  
adversaries that need to be monitored\). Geographic density \(i.e., urban, suburban,  
rural\), for example, may suggest that attendees from rural areas coming to a confer-  
ence held in an urban location might require more preparatory communications  
regarding travel and safety precautions. ee

A target market will include varying combinations of these segmentation vari-  
ables, which could indicate affinity markets and niche markets to be approached as  
well as features that may appeal to these segments. A festival or sport event attract-  
ing a significant percentage of international visitors might wish to create advertising  
translated into these languages and may need to include translations on the on-site  
event signage. Socio-economic and consumer loyalty indicators may suggest prefer-  
ential features such as special parking areas, entrances, or attractions, which will  
likely require additional or special security tactics. The risk manager needs to know  
as much about the potential customer as the marketer does.  
Marketing messages and mediums  
Effective marketing messages are developed by defining the event’s unique value  
proposition for the attendee, determining what needs to be communicated to each  
target market, creating brand identity using distinctive and compelling verbal and  
visual imagery, and ensuring consistency in positioning, message, and branding.  
Brand and image management is particularly important for recurring events and  
should be carefully considered for first-time or one-off events. Recurring events will  
have a brand \(i.e., image and reputation\) and that brand needs to be protected, which  
may include everything from logo or event title trademarks to venue contracts con-  
trolling juxtaposition of incompatible groups \(e.g., a hotel booking concurrent meet-  
ings of direct competitors or conflicting behaviors\). First-time or one-off events need  
to establish a branding strategy and tactics to increase the probability of success.  
Selecting the appropriate mediums for conveying marketing messages requires an  
understanding of the various mediums available and their relative strengths and  
weaknesses. As with communication in general, there are countless tools and tech-  
nologies available to the marketer to transmit a message\:  
¢ Broadcast mediums \(e.g., television, radio\)  
¢ Print mediums \(e.g., cards, brochures, posters, publications, billboards\)  
¢ Online and digital mediums \(e.g., Internet websites, email, blogs, podcasting, text  
messaging\)  
¢ Verbal mediums \(e.g., telemarketing, word-of-mouth marketing, presentations\).  
The choices should be made according to target market preference and penetration,  
and according to the market life cycle. For example, younger markets will likely Marketing issues 217  
prefer digital mediums but older markets will likely prefer broadcast and print  
mediums. Festival or leisure events targeting a local market in a high-density urban  
area might select outdoor and mass transit advertising, and industry-specific con-  
ventions typically employ sequential direct mail tactics including brochures and  
blast emails. The tactics selected must comply with consumer regulations such as  
‘truth in advertising’ laws \(e.g., avoiding exaggeration or unsubstantiated claims of  
expected benefits, such as promising career advancement by attending the confer-  
ence\) and ‘anti-spam’ legislation \(e.g., the ‘CAN-SPAM’ Act of 2003 in the U.S. that  
regulates commercial electronic mail messages\).  
Integrated marketing strategy  
It is widely recommended that an integrated marketing strategy be developed to  
ensure objectives are achieved. This includes selecting marketing activities in accor-  
dance with target market characteristics, developing a marketing mix that builds on  
and reinforces each activity’s strength and objectives, establishing a schedule of  
marketing activities to achieve awareness, interest, desire, and action \(known by its  
acronym AIDA\), and integrating all marketing activities to ensure consistency and  
timeliness. Typical meeting and event marketing tools are shown in Table 9.3, which  
should be examined by the event marketer to identify opportunities and by the  
event risk manager to determine vulnerabilities. Hoyle \(2002\) cautions that the mar-  
keting strategy must include the mechanisms for monitoring external conditions at

all times \(e.g., terrorism alerts, competitive events, economic downturns, etc.\) in  
order to integrate this information and/or the changes instigated by them through-  
out all the marketing activities, and recommends that response plans be developed  
concurrently with the marketing plans.  
# Promotions  
Promotion encompasses the procurement, orchestration, and organization of adver-  
tising campaigns, promotional events, cross promotion alliances, and contest or  
giveaway activities conducted to generate attention, interest, and demand for the  
event project. It is how the message reaches the buyer using an integrated variety of  
marketing tools that are chosen based on how and where the target markets get their  
information and make their buying decisions. The primary methods used include  
advertising, sales promotions, promotional events, and cross promotions. Each of  
these methods use a variety of mediums to communicate messages and influence  
buyer behavior, and each has certain risks that must be recognized and addressed.  
Again, it is important to fully integrate all the promotional activities and reinforce all  
activities with consistent messages and branding in alternate mediums, as well as  
public relations activities. As Kennedy \(1991\) asserts, image congruency is vital.  
# Advertising  
Advertising is the purchase of space in various mediums to deliver messages to pro-  
mote the event project. As such, it is a procurement activity subject to the contractual  
issues identified in Chapters 3 and 7. The strengths and weaknesses of available  
media outlets and techniques must be assessed, suitable media outlets need to be  
identified according to target markets and marketing objectives, media buys have to  
be negotiated and executed, and the delivery of media buys and activities must ver-  
ified and their performance evaluated. The aims of advertising include creating  
awareness, informing, persuading, or reminding \(Kotler et al., 1996; Middleton with  
Clarke, 2001\) and each medium offers different capabilities and limitations. The fol-  
lowing cautions should be considered by the event marketer and risk manager.  
e Mass media\: \(i.e., television, radio, and newspapers\) lack of or limited target mar-  
ket selectivity means that everyone will know about the event, even undesirable  
attendees or disruptive constituencies.  
° Print\: long lead times for magazines, brochures, and other publications may limit  
ability to change message content; direct mail may have a junk mail image; poster,  
sign, flyer, or leaflet distribution or posting may be regulated and may be considered  
or become litter; invitations may have missing information, misspelled names, or use  
improper etiquette.  
Indoor/outdoor advertising\: lack of target selectivity \(see mass media\) and potential  
for vandalism \(corruption of message/image\) to posters and billboards.  
Electronic media\: email regulations may require permission marketing; website  
integrity may be compromised and target market access selectivity likely uncon-  
trollable; e-commerce websites require transaction security and may be subject to  
disabled-access laws; online commentary \(e.g., blogs, listserv groups\) may be sub-  
ject to defamation liability.  
¢ Telemarketing\: often intrusive and may be regulated \(permission marketing\). Marketing issues 219  
¢ Things change\: do not guarantee appearances or attractions \(include ‘subject to  
change’ language as appropriate\); make certain there is a mechanism for provid-  
ing updates, refunds, and/or alternate date \(e.g., rain date\) as appropriate.  
An advertising campaign must be carefully planned to ensure the investment pro-  
vides value and the messages reach the intended target audiences at the right times.  
A haphazard plan or one that is based on personal preference rather than sound metrics  
\(e.g., precise viewer/reader/listener numbers and demographics\) will be expensive  
and ineffective. Given the cost of ad space/time and the limited characteristics of  
viewer/listener impression comprehension, most advertising messages should focus  
on simple content and attention-getting imagery that capitalizes on cognitive \(infor-  
mation\), affective \(emotion\), and conative \(action inspiring\) communication strategies  
\(Masterman and Wood, 2006\). This should be supplemented with in-depth informa-  
tion delivered in highly targeted event collateral and public relations activities.  
Media buys will be based on cost, reach \(target audience\), frequency \(repetition  
requirements\), efficiency, scheduling, and impact \(Getz, 1997; Kaatz, 1989; Kotler et al.,  
1996\). Media buys are often negotiated as a sponsorship consisting of discounted or  
matching ad space \(Getz, 1997\) and must take other sponsorships and strategic  
alliances into account. For example, a small local festival acquired a beverage sponsor  
with the agreement that the beverage company would receive logo inclusion in the  
event's billboard advertising. However, the media buy, which included a matching  
donation of ad space, was not with the outdoor advertising company that the bever-  
age sponsor had an exclusivity agreement with and therefore the beverage company  
could not allow their logo on the billboards, which prompted the cancellation of the  
sponsorship. The loss of the beverage sponsor’s financial and product contribution to  
the event far outweighed the value of the matched media buy.  
Promotional events, sales promotions, and cross  
# promotions  
Promotional events are special events and activities conducted by event marketers to  
increase awareness of and interest in the event project and sales promotions are activi-  
ties conducted to increase ticket sales and attendance by creating demand and purchase  
urgency, thereby stimulating action by event customers. Glaesser \(2006\) notes that they  
can also be effective in overcoming the after effects of a crisis by communicating readi-  
ness to continue ‘business as usual’ or the fact that the event will take place as sched-  
uled despite external conditions. The range of activities is virtually endless, ranging  
from publicity stunts to ‘early bird’ specials to discount coupons to giveaways. Clear  
and measurable objectives must be set for each activity undertaken, and each activity  
needs thorough planning, including its own risk assessment. Of prime importance is  
compatibility with the purpose and nature of the main event and its target audience.

Anti-Disco night causes mayhem  
July 12, 1979\: An ill-conceived special promotion conducted at the Major League Baseball dou-  
bleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers in Comiskey Park in Chicago i a i  
220 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
turned into mayhem when spectators turned unruly and flooded onto the field after local radio  
disc jockey Steve Dahl exploded a box and then a metal dumpster filled with records as a mock  
demolition of disco music centerfield during the intermission between the two games. The dis-  
count admission scheme \(98 cents and a disco record\) and was devised by Dahl and White Sox  
owner Bill Veeck’s son Mike in hopes that lagging attendance would be increased by 5000.  
Instead, 50 000 turned out, most of whom were not baseball fans — more like rock concert goers —  
who attended specifically for the demolition. In addition to the damage to the field by the  
intended explosion and the unintended vandalism that occurred in the pandemonium that fol-  
lowed, the excess records that were not collected at admission gates were thrown from the  
stands towards the field like Frisbees throughout the first game and during the promotional  
stunt causing numerous injuries to spectators as the discs hit and sliced into them. The second  
game was cancelled and the White Sox forfeited both games due to the damage and mayhem.  
Using an event as a promotional tool in marketing campaigns for other products  
or services must also be carefully considered. Any event requires the same attention  
to the administrative, design, and logistical responsibilities associated with events  
management, including a proper risk assessment. Marketing professionals are not  
necessarily events management professionals and may lack the experience or under-  
standing of the issues associated with bringing large groups of people together in a  
particular time and space. This becomes particularly evident when craze marketing \~  
strategies \(i.e., a competitive rush to acquire a valued object\) are employed.

Hazardous store openings  
September 2, 2004\: Swedish furniture and home goods giant IKEA’s new showroom opening  
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, turned deadly when 20 000 instead of the expected 3000 to 5000 shop-  
pers showed up to get the cash vouchers offered to the first 250 through the door. Three peo-  
ple were killed and 16 injured in the crowd crush caused by so many people trying to get in,  
which was exacerbated when the store opened an hour early due to the crowd size and those  
at the rear started pushing their way towards the front.  
February 10, 2005\: The IKEA store Opening in Edmonton, north of London, offered large dis-  
counts for a limited period upon opening at midnight. Crowd management problems occurred  
again as up to 7000 bargain-hunters showed up when only 2000 were expected. One man was  
stabbed, five had to be hospitalized, and store security guards and shoppers were assaulted as  
the crowd tried to force their Way into the store, and, once inside, were fighting over deeply dis-  
counted furniture. Although the store had planned to be open for 24 hours during this promo-  
tion, it had to close 30 minutes after it opened due to the chaos and police were called in to  
disperse the crowd.

Publicity stunts must be carefully considered from a risk management perspective  
because they are all too often potentially hazardous and sometimes downright danger-  
ous, with the danger being the guarantee for media coverage. Hoyle \(2002\) contends So a ccc  
Marketing issues 221  
that the proliferation of outrageous television programming may have instigated the  
increase in bizarre or dangerous stunts just to break through the clutter to capture atten-  
tion, but cautions that these may alienate the audience and cause negative rather than  
positive publicity. Celebrity appearances, often arranged within sponsorship agree-  
ments, can be very effective at creating awareness and interest through increased media  
coverage, as well as boost affinity and credibility through the implied endorsement, but  
they often require special security personnel and precautions as well as contingency  
plans and/or insurance coverage for non-appearance \(and any scandal surrounding  
the celebrity will have an impact on the event\).  
Sales promotions such as contests, discount coupons, proof-of-purchase or donation  
discounts, and frequency or volume discounts are often used to increase purchases at  
specific times or to penetrate new or underperforming target markets. Contests, raf-  
fles, and sweepstakes require special attention due to the gaming character of such  
activities, especially as the value of the prize increases \(Silvers, 2004a\). The appropri-  
ateness and legalities of conducting these activities must be confirmed before they are  
undertaken, and they must be conducted in a manner that is absolutely above  
reproach; there must be no ‘actual or perceived conflict of interest’ and must be com-  
pletely ‘nondiscriminatory in terms of entry qualifications and access’ \(Silvers, 2004a,  
p. 333\). The use of coupons, proof-of-purchase schemes, and other discount systems  
requires a fully integrated infrastructure to ensure the transaction procedures can  
accommodate them. For example, if giving a discount for bringing a canned food item  
for a homeless shelter, sufficient containers and transport for the collected canned  
goods must be arranged. Measures to prevent counterfeiting should be considered for  
any controlled coupon or proof-of-purchase discount system or contest.  
Many promotional activities are coordinated with sponsors, charity beneficiaries,  
suppliers, and compatible organizations to increase market penetration and  
decrease the investment costs of each participant. These must be considered as part-  
nerships and, as such, require considerable cooperation and clear communications.  
The roles and responsibilities of each partner must be precisely delineated, goals and  
objectives must be clearly specified, reciprocal logo and brand usage must be explic-  
itly defined, and media tie-ins must be carefully negotiated. Logo usage, placement,  
and context restrictions should be of particular importance. For example, a civic fes-  
tival arranged to have its logo included on the letterhead for all city communica-  
tions, which, unfortunately, also included the solid waste department. One day this  
department issued a toxic waste notice that was faxed out to every city employee  
that included a huge skull and crossbones right under the festival logo; not the pro-  
motional link the festival was anticipating when they made the agreement.  
The synergy created by cross promotions can deliver considerable cost-saving and  
image-enhancing benefits, but it must be remembered that an affiliation will be  
established in the public’s perception and the activities conducted by each partner  
\(positive or negative\) will reflect on the other partner\(s\). The event organization  
must protect the integrity of its image and message as well as respect that of its part-  
ners. This is also why meeting and event organizers must take steps to control ad  
hoc or ancillary activities conducted by others in conjunction with their event; the  
same perceived affiliation will occur \(Berlonghi, 1990\).  
Promotional collateral materials and services  
A broad variety of marketing materials will be required to support promotional  
events and activities. These can range from displays for in-store demonstrations and 222 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
trade show participation to program books for meeting delegates and festival goers  
to imprinted giveaways for theme parties and product launches. Content must be  
acquired from internal and external stakeholders and contributors, logo usage and  
brand or theme imagery must be monitored, and the appropriate language, style,  
organization, and format must be used according to the subject matter, time sensi-  
tivity, and intended audience.  
Numerous opportunities and vulnerabilities occur from a risk management perspec-  
tive. The opportunities include such things as providing health and safety tips in mar-  
keting brochures for festivals and meeting registration materials, including emergency  
contact numbers on delegate badges or site map handouts, and the inclusion of ingre-  
dients on menu cards at banquets or responsible alcohol consumption messages on  
table tents at receptions. Any and all special conditions and particularly restrictions  
should be clearly communicated via advertising and promotional materials whenever  
possible \(FEMA, 2001\). The vulnerabilities include, among other things, inaccurate,  
incomplete, or outdated content, improper logo usage \(e.g., color, placement, or unau-  
thorized use\), counterfeited coupons or credentials, intellectual property infringement,  
lack of continuity \(i.e., mixed messages\), and lack of good old fashioned proof reading.  
Public relations  
Public relations is a marketing tool used to gain publicity coverage for an event proj-  
ect and/or the event organization using communication to build relationships with its  
various publics in an effort to increase awareness, credibility, and enthusiasm, as well  
as reduce overall promotion costs \(Kotler et al., 1999\). It encompasses the cultivation  
and conservation of beneficial relationships with the media, as well as preparing for  
the enhancement and control of the impressions, image, and issues surrounding the  
event project and enterprise, particularly in times of crisis or controversy.  
Unlike advertising, coverage generated through public relations activities is not pur-  
chased, which creates a third party endorsement \(e.g., what someone else says about  
your event\), is perceived as unbiased \(Skinner and Rukavina, 2003\), and has greater  
opportunities to provide more in-depth and background information capable of influ-  
encing attitudes of the target publics. Kotler et al. refer to this as ‘share of mind’ \(1999,  
p. 571\). Kennedy contends that recipients of marketing messages are ‘stubbornly reluc-  
tant to believe them’ \(1991, p. 48\) and suggests that these messages must be substanti-  
ated with testimonials, statistics, research results, and other proofs in order to be  
perceived as credible, and Masterman and Wood assert that ‘earned media’ such as  
consumer reports, reviews, peer recommendations, and published articles are more  
‘believable’ \(2006, p. 89\); all of which can be achieved through public relations activities.  
Public relations strategy  
Developing a public relations strategy involves identification of the scope and  
nature of the various internal and external publics, definition of the needs and objec-  
tives for public relations activities, development of well-articulated and credible  
messages that can be communicated to the various applicable publics, and the iden-  
tification of the mediums and methods capable of effectively and efficiently reaching  
those publics. Public relations activities should be considered for all internal and Sse

external stakeholder constituencies as well as the consumer target markets in proac-  
tive and reactive contexts and from both a political and a promotional standpoint,  
and certainly within a crisis management perspective.  
There are numerous tactics that may be employed within a public relations strat-  
egy \(see Table 9.4\), and in large organizations these activities are typically organized  
through marketing, publicity, or business communications departments and per-  
formed by individuals known as public relations specialists, media specialists, com-  
munications specialists, publicists, public affairs specialists, or information officers.  
These responsibilities may be outsourced or assigned to a single marketing director  
or a committee in smaller event organizations. The risk manager should team up  
with the public relations person or department to ensure that the activities to be con-  
ducted are included in the event’s risk assessment and to confirm their readiness to  
actively participate in crisis management situations.  
Public relations should be viewed as a year-round activity for recurring and first-  
time events, and for one-off events activities should be considered before, during, as  
well as after the event; post-event coverage can set the stage for \(or inspire\) future  
endeavors. It is advisable to establish archival procedures that collect and retain copies  
of all public relations materials and coverage for evaluation purposes and future strat-  
egy development. It is also widely recommended that media kits and other back-  
ground materials be developed that will enhance current public relations efforts and  
these will become particularly helpful when responding to a crisis or emergency situ-  
ation. Materials to consider are shown in Table 9.5.  
Image, issues, and crisis management  
Public relations activities often focus on image and issue management objectives in  
addition to general promotional or publicity coverage. In this context it is important to  
develop governmental, community, and public affairs programs to determine issues  
and trends that may impact the event objectives or production as a facet of constituency  
or stakeholder management \(see Chapter 8\). Public relations personnel ‘must under-  
stand the attitudes and concerns of community, consumer, employee, and public inter-  
est groups and establish and maintain cooperative relationships with them and with  
representatives from print and broadcast journalism’ \(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2006\). ES

Image management seeks to create name recognition and generate an affinity for an  
event project and event organization through the establishment of influential educa-  
tion and information activities to help shape positive public opinions. Equally, it seeks  
to protect the image of the event and event organization from degradation due to mis- \_  
information, misalignment, or malice. This protective function will be closely linked  
with issues management and will require close attention to activities and media cov-  
erage generated by outside sources. As discussed with stakeholder management,  
methods for interaction and accommodation between the event organization and its  
publics, allied and opposing, must be identified and cultivated.  
Regester and Larkin \(2002\) define an issue as a point of conflict or a gap between an  
organization and its publics, typically due to external political, regulatory, economic,  
social, or technological change, as well as internal administrative or operational  
change. An issue can transition from a potential issue to an emerging issue to a crisis  
situation unless it is recognized, its potential impact is analyzed, and it is monitored  
closely in order to intervene in a timely manner. The emerging stage is when increas-  
ing external awareness of the issue occurs and early detection increases the organiza-  
tion’s ability to influence reaction through public relations activities. Warning signals  
for identifying crisis-bound issues include public resistance, official health or safety  
warnings, persistent customer complaints, lax compliance standards, and pleas from  
employees \(Harvard Business Essentials, 2004\). The risk manager and public relations  
director should maintain an issues log that anticipates, tracks status, and prompts  
action in a preemptive manner.  
Should an issue reach the crisis stage, an aggressive public relations approach is  
required. Regester and Larkin \(2002\) contend that the three C’s of crisis management  
are concern, control, and commitment, and provide the following observations and  
suggestions for communications in a public relations context and for the communica-  
tors in a crisis\:  
¢ Actas a facilitator to explain what has ha  
ppened and to ensure appropriate actionis being /has been taken.  
¢ Tell your story; information voids will be filled with rumor, misinformation, and  
misrepresentation so the organization must be prepared to fill it with credible  
information. a ee  
Marketing issues 225  
° Tell your story fast; the media may begin as neutral or even sympathetic, but if they  
believe the organization is too slow at providing information, they may become  
hostile.  
e When appearing on television, jump on untruths, innuendo, or misleading  
remarks immediately, interrupting the interviewer if necessary.  
e Understand, harness, and manage public emotion; communicate in language that  
relates to and alleviates anxiety.  
¢ Conveying grave concern and decisive action is essential in any situation involving  
injury or loss of life.  
e Never speculate about the cause; if wrong it will can seen as an attempt to cover  
up or hide the truth \(and could nullify insurance coverage\).  
¢ Never admit liability; an official investigation will establish that.  
¢ Never point the finger of blame; an official investigation will establish that.  
The risk manager should confirm that there is a method for ensuring incidents or  
controversies are promptly identified internally, the protocols for communicating  
with and including emergency response agencies in public relations response activ-  
ities are in place and effective, the media spokespersons for the event organization  
are designated and trained properly, and that information can be communicated  
quickly to prevent speculation and misrepresentation.  
Media relations  
Public relations professionals must cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with  
the media \(i.e., newspapers, radio, television, Internet journalists, and publication  
editors\) in order to achieve the objectives for publicity coverage. These relationships  
are critically important during a crisis, controversy, or emergency to ensure report-  
ing is properly framed \(Harvard Business Essentials, 2004\). This relationship starts  
with the development of a media list that specifies contact information for individ-  
ual media representatives \(e.g., editors, journalists, reporters, etc.\) and contact pro-  
tocols for each media outlet. The relationship is then built by preparing media  
releases and requests that are timely and newsworthy, respecting and accommodat-  
ing the media’s needs and restrictions, providing the media with appropriate access  
and facilities, and always providing accurate and credible information. However, if  
an emergency, controversy, or crisis should occur, the media will likely descend on  
the event in aggressive droves. As Henderson \(2007, p. 164\) notes, \*... crises attract  
intense media interest and modern communications technology assists in the collec-  
tion and distribution of information about occurrences and their aftermath, includ-  
ing images recorded by victims.’

Media partner attracts unanticipated vandalism  
A charity football game between two local law enforcement agencies was organized as a pub-  
lic relations event to increase positive feelings towards the officers and their important function  
within the community. This admirable cause drew considerable support for the all-volunteer i  
226 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
event, including the donation of money to purchase uniforms and equipment, use of a high  
school stadium, and the commitment from a local television station to broadcast the game live,  
which was widely advertised by the television station. Upon arriving at the stadium early in  
the morning of game day, organizers found highly offensive graffiti aimed at law enforcement  
painted on the field and throughout the grandstands, which would have been visible on cam-  
era during the broadcast and jeopardized the television coverage. Such vandalism had not even  
been considered by the law enforcement personnel organizing the event. Nevertheless, even  
though the game was scheduled to start in four hours, they were able to get a work crew of pris-  
oners from the county jail brought over to completely repaint the grandstands and steam clean  
the Astroturf field in time for the stadium to open for spectators and the game was broadcast as  
planned. The lesson was learned and the following year overnight security was provided by  
off-duty police officers prior to game day.  
Official spokespersons  
The public relations representatives deliver the good news and the bad news. In addi-  
tion to creating a figurehead or focal point of authority for media appearances in a  
publicity context, designating and training an official spokesperson \(or persons\) is a  
key component of a risk management plan, and the first element of a crisis manage- \_  
ment plan \(Kotler et al., 1999\). The possibility of strong demand or loss of personnel  
suggests that several spokespersons be designated and Regester and Larkin \(2002\)  
recommend two or three official spokespeople be regularly available to the media.  
Glaesser \(2006\) advises that spokespersons should have a forceful personality and  
come from the upper echelon of the organization to enhance credibility. It is also  
advisable to designate the official spokespersons for all lead agencies and authorities  
involved, and the protocols to be followed when responding to the media and others.  
Training spokespersons is necessary. The event wants to make certain the person  
speaking on behalf of the organization delivers the correct information and proper  
messages in a professional manner. In a crisis situation, reporters will likely be  
shouting out difficult and controversial questions in a rapid and aggressive manner.  
This is very intimidating and requires a cool head and calm demeanor — a skill that  
requires practice. The Federal Emergency Management Agency offers the following  
pointers for spokespersons \(Haddon and Bullock, 2003, p. 162\)\:  
Repeat information to reinforce key message points.  
Correct inaccuracies, otherwise they will be accepted as fact.  
Pair use of statistics with stories or case studies that bring them to life.  
Stay out of other people’s business; let other emergency agencies answer their  
own questions.  
e Always be honest. If you don’t know an answer to a question, say so and offer to  
find the answer or refer the reporter to someone who can.  
It is important to understand that during a crisis or emergency situation everything  
said by anyone in the event organization is ‘on the record’ — it could be quoted or ref-  
erenced in the reporting done by the media. All media and other inquiries should be  
referred to the designated spokesperson or officials and it must be explained to  
event personnel why this is imperative\: that in a crisis everything must be factual Marketing issues 227  
and they may not have all the facts, and that speculation and rumor often leads to  
the reporting of false information. However, internal stakeholders and personnel  
should be communicated with and advised of facts as soon as possible to prevent  
speculation and rumor.  
Sponsorship management  
Sponsorship management encompasses the identification, solicitation, securing,  
servicing, and retention of sponsors, donors, and philanthropic patrons through the  
proper valuation and delivery of suitable tangible and intangible benefits to provide  
financial and cost avoidance support for the event project. The terminology for these  
benefactor initiatives may vary in different event sectors, such as donor cultivation  
in the non-profit sector or strategic alliances in the association or corporate sectors,  
but the bottom line objective of fiscal support remains the same. The risks often  
remain the same as well, which include, among other things\:  
Over confidence in or over dependence on sponsorship revenue.  
Overwhelming or overshadowing the event with sponsor imagery and activities.  
Unsuitable or conflicting sponsors.  
Lack of due diligence in evaluating sponsors or sponsorship packages.  
Non-fulfillment of contractual obligations.  
Non-compliance with legal and regulatory restrictions or requirements.  
e¢ Ambush marketing and other unauthorized non-sponsor and predatory activities.  
First and foremost is the determination of the suitability of commercial sponsorship  
and non-commercial support for the event. Not all events are appropriate for spon-  
sorship and for those that are, careful attention must be paid to structuring the spon-  
sorship program and its revenue and cost-avoidance objectives to ensure the purpose  
and brand of the event is not diluted. Potential sponsors or donors must be solicited  
and selected based on their appropriateness and target market match to the event  
audience and its attitudes or characteristics. Will the sponsor attract controversy?  
Will controversy at an event impact the sponsor? Will the exit of a sponsor or the fail-  
ure to attract the number or type of sponsors projected jeopardize the financial via-  
bility of the event? Answers to these questions will help shape contingency plans.  
It is particularly important to specify conflict of interest criteria and limits on what  
can/will and can not/will not be allowed within the sponsorship agreement and on  
site at the event. Sponsor exclusivity categories must specify the scope of that exclu-  
sivity; a sports event, for example, may control the event but not the teams partici-  
pating in the event, which may mean that a direct competitor of an event sponsor  
might have their name and logo on all the athletes’ uniforms \(IEG, 1996\). Sponsor  
and donor on-site recognition and activities must be specified and incorporated into  
the event’s operational plans. Signage and banners must be incorporated into the  
décor, and promotional displays \(e.g., inflatables, vehicles, structures, etc.\) must be  
positioned safely within the site plan \(HSE, 1999\).  
It is also imperative that one understands the legalities of sponsorship agreements  
and the acceptance of donations. There may be advertising restrictions, antitrust  
repercussions, tax implications, and a broad variety of reporting requirements. For a  
228 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
example, there are restrictions in many jurisdictions on the types of media exposure  
and signage allowed for alcoholic beverage sponsors \(Berlonghi, 1990\), as well as  
whether or not they are allowed to provide product as an in-kind donation to an  
event. And, although most events must actively pursue sponsors, some events may  
have sponsors and donors seeking them out because of the status, size, or target  
market affinity the event offers; in which case equal opportunity must be offered  
within the confines of fairly and uniformly enforced criteria in order to prevent  
potential violations of antitrust laws \(Foster, 2002\). For example, many trade shows  
require that all sponsors must be exhibitors. Tax implications \(e.g., the unrelated  
business income tax \(UBIT\) laws in the U.S.\) may center on what portion\(s\) of the  
benefits provided by the event are taxable as advertising income or non-taxable  
because only recognition is provided \(Skinner and Rukavina, 2003\).  
Consider this... 9.4  
Goodies in award show gift bags seen as taxable income  
Gift bags given to presenters and nominees at the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Academy  
Awards are seen as taxable income according to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service \(IRS\). This is  
due to the advertising cost tax deductions given to the companies donating the items included  
in the gift bags because the products are contributed in anticipation of publicity, not given as  
gifts. The products included in the gift bags can consist of designer clothing, jewelry, cosmetics,  
gourmet edibles, sports club memberships, luggage, and vacations. The 2006 Emmy Awards gift  
bags had an estimated value of between \$27 000 and \$33 000, and the 2006 Academy Award gift  
bags were valued at \$100000. The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, organizers of the  
Emmy Awards, notified presenters by mail of the taxable status of the gift bags, and included a  
waiver to sign acknowledging receipt of the letter in order to remove liability for the organizers,  
and recipients were required to fill out IRS forms upon receipt of the luxurious gift package.

Selling and servicing commercial sponsorships  
Of particular interest to many large public events \(e.g., festivals and sports events\) is  
the selling of commercial sponsorships to provide much needed revenues for an  
event's operations and to ensure prestige and growth. Commercial sponsorship, as  
defined by the International Events Group, is the payment of a cash or in-kind fee in  
return for access to the exploitable commercial potential associated with an event  
property \(IEG, 1996\). Sponsorship, also known as event marketing, is big business  
involving considerable sums of money and serious responsibilities. Since a commer-  
cial sponsorship is a contractual relationship between the event organization and the  
sponsor, careful attention must be paid to the crafting of this relationship. The event  
must be able to service the contractual obligations, including the delivery of all  
promised benefits, under whatever circumstances may occur.  
Sponsorship contracts often include the following sponsor benefits\: the category  
or exclusivity status based on level of investment, signage at the event \(type, size, \[Se ee  
Marketing issues 229  
and number\), advertising credits, merchandising rights, and access benefits such as  
tickets, passes, special areas, hospitality opportunities, etc. \(Skinner and Rukavina,  
2003\). The contract will also address obligations for both parties, such as the fees to be  
paid, the exclusivity to be maintained, logo and trademark usage policies, and restric-  
tions placed on either party regarding ancillary activities. Great specificity should be  
included in such contracts to ensure that each party to the contract \(the event and the  
sponsor\) knows their responsibilities and the limits of their benefits, authority, and  
acceptable activities. Many sponsorship contracts offer first right of refusal for renewal  
that must be honored, which should include decision deadlines that allow sufficient  
time for recruiting a replacement. The event should always prepare a post-event ful-  
fillment report that documents the delivery of benefits and the media exposure  
received.  
Commercial sponsors will be diligent about controlling their legal liability and  
potential negative exposure in connection with their purchase. They will also strive to  
increase the positive exposure associated with the alliance with an event. The event  
organization, and the event risk manager, should liaise with the corporate sponsor’s  
own legal and risk management departments to coordinate assessment activities and  
take advantage of its expertise and resources.  
Ambush marketing  
Of particular interest to commercial sponsors \(and trade show exhibitors\) is the con-  
trol of ambush marketing tactics employed to take advantage of the event's target  
market without payment of fees for the access to the commercial potential of the event.  
Such activities dilute the value of the investment in the sponsorship. The event that  
does not monitor and control this runs the risk of losing sponsorship revenues. Tactics  
such as extensive media buys by direct competitors of major sponsors using language  
that implies an affiliation with the event or erecting promotional displays adjacent to  
the event site \(also known as outboarding\) create a perceived relationship with the  
event. The event organization should be diligent about trademarking and protecting  
the event’s brand and logo imagery and should make every effort to control adjacent  
activities if possible. Getz \(1997\) reported that some major events have taken an  
aggressive counteractive approach by issuing public statements confronting the  
ambush marketers.  
Other aspects of unauthorized marketing activity that should be monitored include  
suitcasing at trade shows, unsanctioned hospitality receptions at conventions, and  
unauthorized product sampling at public events. Suitcasing refers to non-exhibitors  
conducting selling activities on or in close proximity to the trade show floor, which  
should be addressed by show floor managers, security personnel, and within facility  
contracts. Major conventions often have numerous sponsored hospitality receptions  
and hospitality suites, and non-sponsors often seek to host similar attendee-attracting  
activities without paying for the privilege. This should be addressed contractually  
with the venue \(e.g., prohibiting hospitality suite bookings that are not sanctioned by  
the event organization\) and promotionally with the attendees \(e.g., including the pol-  
icy in registration materials and publishing a list of official suites and receptions\).  
Public events such as festivals often allow sponsors to conduct on-site sampling  
and couponing activities wherein attendees are given small product samples or dis-  
count or voucher coupons for their products. Non-sponsors may try to conduct sim-  
ilar activities, particularly if the event has a large attendance and little or no entrance  
fee. This must be strictly controlled because not only does it devalue the sponsor's a a a Se  
230 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
benefit, the sponsor will have provided the event organization with proofs of prod-  
uct liability coverage and the trespasser will not. In addition, the event may not want  
certain products distributed to its audience \(e.g., tobacco products\). Large crowds  
also often attract those who wish to distribute pamphlets or flyers for a particular  
campaign or cause. One may not be able to restrict the freedom of speech of an indi-  
vidual that has paid the requisite admission fee, but any distribution of material  
should be able to be prohibited and disruptive behavior should result in ejection for  
cause. The rights of the event organization to do this should be confirmed with the  
venue and local authorities.  
Sales activities  
It is hoped that all this marketing activity leads to the sales transaction — the purchase  
of the admission ticket or registration package, the sale of a sponsorship, the buying of  
a treasured souvenir or special treatment. The management of these sales activities  
includes the establishment and supervision of procedures, platforms, and transaction  
processes for all the on-site, remote, and electronic sales activities connected with the  
event project in order to achieve profit expectations. These sales activities include such  
revenue streams as registration and ticketing operations, food and merchandise con-  
cession sales, and other retail endeavors. The environment in which these activities ©  
take place must be considered from the logistical as well as an image or branding  
perspective.  
The risk manager should confirm that a solid business plan is in place that has  
determined the income requirements and sales objectives for all products, event tick-  
ets, and other revenue streams, and has established product lines and pricing struc-  
tures according to capacity control needs and desirability or proximity demand.  
Incentives used to encourage desired consumer behavior and cash flow \(e.g., dis-  
counted ‘early bird’ registration fees or ‘last chance’ event souvenir bargains\) should  
employ inventory management tactics to maximize revenues according to supply  
and demand conditions.  
In addition, the exchange of money for goods or services typically requires the  
authority to do so, which may necessitate the possession of a business or merchant  
license and the registration with the appropriate local, state or provincial, or national  
taxation and revenue authorities. Failure to address these business basics can jeop-  
ardize the event \(resulting in closure\) and the event organization \(resulting in fines  
or penalties\). Compliance by all those who conduct selling activities on site at or on  
behalf of the event should also be confirmed.  
Sales platforms and procedures  
Event access, products, and services can be sold through many different portals,  
ranging from online to off-site locations to on site at the event, and purchases may be  
made in person, by mail, over the telephone, or through the Internet. E-commerce  
technology should be identified and employed as appropriate, the parameters for  
sales activities by authorized external sales outlets must be established, and the  
equipment, materials, and staff responsibilities for in-office and on-site sales activi-  
ties must be determined and coordinated. Tickets, coupons, and vouchers must be  
considered as cash value assets and protected from loss, theft, or counterfeiting by ee  
Marketing issues 231  
establishing methods for accounting for and auditing unsold tickets or vouchers. All  
authorized on-site or remote sales activities must be closely monitored and unau-  
thorized activities \(e.g., ticket scalping or touting\) must be controlled.  
Transaction procedures must be established that ensure high customer service lev-  
els and protect the revenues generated from sales activities \(bad customer service can  
result in, at best, negative word of mouth publicity and, at worst, confrontation or  
retaliation incidents\). The appropriate equipment necessary for processing transac-  
tions must be obtained \(e.g., credit card equipment, cash drawers, etc.\); effective cash  
handling procedures must be developed and implemented \(see Chapter 7\); and suffi-  
cient training must be provided for personnel handling those transactions, including  
the procedures for processing all inducements, discounts, coupon redemptions, and  
refunds. The risk manager should confirm that all sales platforms and transaction pro-  
cedures are thoroughly integrated and are assessed to uncover any vulnerability  
within the system.  
# Merchandise  
Many events sell souvenirs that not only extend the legacy of the event experience;  
they also provide important revenue streams to the event organization. In addition,  
many events, particularly festivals and public spectator events, will sell concession-  
aires the rights to sell food, beverages, and retail merchandise at the event. These  
endeavors require a thorough understanding of retailing in order to be successful,  
which is why many event organizations will subcontract the event’s souvenir mer-  
chandising to professionals in the retail field, and establish policies for concessionaires  
that clearly state the limits and requirements for authorized selling activities con-  
ducted at the event. Before embarking on such endeavors the event organization must  
determine the liabilities and legalities associated with merchandising, licensing, and  
concession agreements, some of which are shown in Table 9.6. Getz \(1997\) advises that,  
similar to sponsorship contracts, licensing agreements should be handled by legal  
counsel to ensure that proper expectations and limitations are contractually specified  
and brand integrity is protected. The same holds true for distributor agreements to  
make certain brand integrity is maintained through quality control and customer serv-  
ice, as well as revenue protection through payment policies and procedures.  
Selling concessionaire rights and space at an event has profit, procurement, and  
product line implications. The event may be selling the concession based on a flat fee or  
a percentage of sales. If employing the percentage arrangement a method must be  
devised for monitoring total sales in order to calculate the amount due. Concessionaires

should be selected based upon providing an effective product mix \(e.g., not too many  
vendors offering the same merchandise\) and their ability to provide proofs of compli-  
ance with all applicable regulations \(e.g., business license, insurance coverage, health  
and safety permits, etc.\). Establishing these parameters in a written policy will help pre-  
vent claims of restraint of trade or discrimination, and enforcing these policies will help  
illustrate due diligence by the event organization.  
Concessionaire contracts should specify the rules and regulations for the set-up,  
operation, and dismantling of their booth, stall, stand, vehicle, display, or tent \(HSE,  
1999\). These regulations should encompass space allotment, location, structural safety,  
storage location and safety, inventory replenishment \(e.g., on-site vehicle movement\),  
equipment safety, hours of operation, and selling activities \(e.g., confinement to within  
space allotment or booth\). Those conducting unauthorized selling activities \(see  
ambush marketing\) should be removed from the event site and the event organization  
should work with local authorities to determine methods for deterring such activities  
adjacent to the event site \(HSE, £999\).  
# Summary  
Everything about meetings and events is about marketing, just as it is all about  
administration, design, operations, and risk management. All these functions are -  
inextricably connected and must be thoroughly integrated. Marketing is applicable  
on a broad range of levels, from the logistic to the strategic, and clarity must be  
achieved when defining the target markets, their needs and expectations, and the  
short- and long-term goals of the organization, including the objectives and require-  
ments for their various internal or external stakeholder constituencies. A balance  
must be achieved between marketing objectives and risk management responsibili-  
ties. The goals of the event’s risk management plans should be completely consistent  
with an event’s marketing goals. Any promotional activity or event must be inte-  
grated into the overall event plans, and the risks must be assessed.  
Event marketing materials and messages must be carefully crafted to ensure they  
are targeting the appropriate constituencies \(attracting the ‘right’ audiences\) and are  
providing correct and credible information \(making the right promises\). The infor-  
mation and instructions included in them must be scanned to make certain they are  
consistent with the operational plans and logistical constraints of the event. They  
must be scheduled properly so as not to strain the capabilities of the delivery mech-  
anisms \(such as ticket sales outlets or functional start times and deadlines\).  
Marketing activities need to be carefully considered to ensure they do not pose  
safety hazards or the potential for negative publicity, and public relations efforts  
should be widely used to educate consumers and constituencies as well as manage  
the event’s image through the good times and bad. Sales activities and strategic  
alliances are meant to enhance the fiscal capabilities of the event organization and  
the value and dimensions of the event experience, which requires forethought and a  
good match between the event organization, its partners, and its audience.

An event ts the marriage of creativity and responsibility  
WOW Factor... something so impressive, surprising, fantastic, sensational, power-  
ful, amazing, unexpected, spectacular, stunning, breathtaking, astonishing, incredi-  
ble, exceptional, dramatic, outstanding, dazzling, or extravagant that it elicits a  
‘WOW!’ from people.  
Meeting and event organizers, designers, and producers are constantly in search  
of ways to bring the WOW Factor into their event experiences. They seek the latest  
and cutting edge environments, activities, and technologies to make the event more  
exciting and memorable. Unfortunately, this rush towards exhilarating originality  
often leads to ‘OW!’ instead of ‘WOW!’ in terms of safety and outcomes because they  
haven’t considered the effects these elements will have on the underlying logistics  
and physical requirements for bringing people together at a certain time, in a partic-  
ular space, for a specific purpose.  
The quest for novelty and innovation is necessary for events to remain competi-  
tive and successful, but it must always be tempered with caution so that the experi-  
ence delivered will be enjoyed rather than endured and the audience will be  
enthralled rather than endangered. The three chapters in this section will examine  
the issues surrounding program design, site management, and attendee manage-  
ment in order to ensure the event experience is designed in such a way that it will  
meet the needs of the people, the place, and the pursuit whilst balancing the WOW  
opportunities with the operational obligations. isnoite1sq

# Introduction  
Design is a creative process that results in an esthetic outcome. Program design  
focuses on the artistic interpretation and expression of the goals and objectives of the  
event project and its experiential dimensions. Designing a meeting or event is creat-  
ing an experience rather than simply an activity or a setting. Bowdin, Allen, O'Toole,  
Harris, and McDonnell \(2006\) describe program design as the flow of the various  
event elements over the duration of the event experience, and cites the need to inte-  
grate the audience expectations, venue constraints, and staging with the sequential  
and logistical requirements. Goldblatt \(2002\) highlights the extensive nature of the  
range of opportunities when designing a program, describing the process as web-  
like or kaleidoscopic rather than linear as one brings together all the aspects of the  
event experience together. O’Toole \(2006b\) emphasizes that event design must be a  
combination of the esthetic with the practical, which coincides with Lawrence’s  
assertion \(2006\) that design is ‘applied’ art, ‘applied to solve a particular problem.’  
In other words, designs must be usable.  
Effective program design requires strategic, esthetic, technical, and logistical skills  
in order to deliver the experience that will provide economic and emotional value to 240 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

the event consumer, and relies on a thorough understanding of the who, what,  
where, when, and why. As illustrated in Figure 10.1, one must be an event architect,  
interpreting the client’s desires and objectives to design the concept or vision for the  
event, but this design process must have a strong foundation in the practicalities of  
event production. One must be an experiential engineer, interpreting that vision and  
shaping that design into a structural plan capable of being implemented through the  
selection and sequencing of the proper program components and elements that will  
deliver the experience desired according to the resources available. And one must be  
an event project manager, ensuring the goods, services, and personnel are procured  
and the logistics of implementing the plan are devised and supervised.  
Design relies on creativity, which is often sparked by such techniques as shown in  
Table 10.1, but must always start with the intent of the event and the goals and objec-  
tives to be achieved. Inspiration and ingenuity will fill the gap between the challenge  
and the solution, forming the plan for the content, which, in turn, establishes the  
extent. The creative concept that is developed must then be evaluated from a market-  
ing, operational, and financial perspective \(Bowdin et al., 2006\), and accepted by the  
client or hosting organization. Trying innovative or unusual ideas is important but  
care must be exercised when pushing design into the ‘new’ or the ‘WOW’ in order to  
minimize the potential for failure due to the inexperience or lack of ability of those  
implementing the event or the misunderstanding or rejection by the audience.  
Each element, each component, each activity, each feature of an event that brings  
the design into reality will have inherent or potential risks associated with its instal-  
lation, equipment, and operation, which must all be carefully managed to control  
risk. The event risk manager must have sufficient knowledge about the logistics and  
mechanics of each individual product or service brought into the event site and made SS ST Senna ssh isis

available to the event audience in order to be able to analyze the likely risks it may  
pose to the audience, personnel, participants, providers, or the event organization.  
Designing the experience  
Pine and Gilmore \(1999\) describe the nature of an experience as the personal engage-  
ment of the consumer in an enjoyable, theatrical, entertaining, and memorable  
encounter. The agenda of activities, elements, exhibits, and amenities that shape the  
composition of the event experience is driven not only by the goals and objectives of  
the event project. It is also driven by the attendee’s demand for individual immer-  
sion in the sensations of the event as well as the benefits to be derived from attend-  
ing. The risks associated with designing the event experience vary according to the  
type of event and the choices made by the event organizers, but it must be remem-  
bered that everything at an event has potential risks \(see Table 10.2\).  
The scope of the elements included in an event will depend on the purpose, size,  
location, budget, and image of the event, the needs of the audience, and the logisti-  
cal and operational requirements associated with those elements. As illustrated in  
Figure 10.2, anything and everything that is scheduled to happen at the event will  
have specific equipment needs, materials that are used, personnel to implement or  
operate it, and site-specific requirements. These must all be analyzed from a risk  
management perspective and incorporated into the overall event plan. This is pre-  
cisely why the event risk manager should be involved in the entire event manage-  
ment process — the design, planning, and operations of the event. 242 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

Activity and content selection  
Whether the event is a convention where various meetings, educational sessions,  
and social activities are planned; a festival where numerous entertainment attrac-  
tions, exhibits, and spectacular fireworks are featured; or a modest or lavish awards  
banquet with dining, dancing, and presentations, there will always be Something to  
do at an event. Selecting the right activities and content \(i.e., subject matter\) to be  
communicated within these activities is based upon a clear understanding of the  
needs and desires of the audience and the objectives and obligations of the event.  
As illustrated in Figure 10.3, the possible event activities \(e.g., sessions, compo-  
nents, features, and/or attractions\) include a broad range of options, and they may  
have different characteristics in terms of purpose, nature, and expected outcomes. Program design 243

Figure 10.3. Potential meeting and event activities  
The event may be spectator or participatory in nature. Activities, entertainment, and  
attractions may be passive, interactive, or purely ‘decorative’ — providing or enhanc-  
ing the atmosphere or theme of an event. The content may be selected to meet edu-  
cational, inspirational, or recreational objectives. For example, conferences often offer  
educational sessions designed to meet certification program requirements, exhibitions  
regularly offer educational sessions on industry issues in order to increase attendance,  
cause-related events typically incorporate elements designed to inspire support, and  
employee appreciation events frequently include recreational activities that are both  
entertaining and promote teamwork.  
Developing the content for educational activities includes the selection of the appro-  
priate topics, formats, and presenters to achieve the communication objectives and  
educational obligations of the event project. Such activities must be devised in such a  
way that recognizes various learning styles, techniques, and strategies, and incorpo-  
rates the principles and dynamics of adult learning. The content should be designed to  
meet the educational needs and the experience levels of the intended audience  
\(Connell, 2002; Krug, 2000\). The speakers, presenters, and other content delivery per-  
sonnel should be selected according to the content scope and topic requirements, as  
well as the program format or delivery systems chosen. Explicit speaker solicitation  
and delivery guidelines should be established that facilitate quality programming.  
Some activities may be components of an event or events in their own right. Cere-  
monies, for example, can cause numerous potential problems if protocol requirements nS  
244 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
or specific religious or ritual requirements are not met, or if the appropriate ceremo-  
nial equipment or personnel to conduct the ceremonial activities is not procured.  
Parades often include floats, marching bands, groups/troupes, or troops, equestrian  
units, giant helium balloon characters, and vehicles, which requires sufficient stag-  
ing areas for line-up and dissolution, unobstructed and traversable routes, and  
parade marshals to escort each unit included in the parade \(Lagauskas\). Animal  
attractions used as décor or entertainment pose hazards for the audience as well as  
the animal, particularly if the animal is large, undomesticated, untrained, or in poor  
condition. Usage considerations include attacks due to contact, discomfort, or  
provocation \(even experienced animal performers are first and foremost animals\),  
audience allergies and phobias, infections or infestations, sanitation, and the ani-  
mal’s welfare, and these animals should always be procured from and managed by  
reputable handlers \(HSE, 1996\).  
Inflatable amusement devices such as ‘bouncy’ cages or castles, rock-climbing walls,  
or Velcro walls must only be acquired from reputable rental dealers and operators  
that enforce strict safety standards for setup, maintenance, and operation to minimize  
the possibility of accidents, and have sufficient liability insurance \(Martinez, 2005\).  
The hazards associated with these devices include wind instability, deflation, suffo-  
cation, and injuries due to falls, overcrowding, failure to separate larger users from  
smaller ones, and entrapment \(HSE, 2001\). Amusement or ‘carnival’ rides are typically  
regulated to ensure they are designed and built to explicit safety specifications; their  
installation undergoes a thorough inspection and receives daily inspections for con-  
dition and deterioration; and they are operated by properly trained operators and  
attendants \(HSE, 1998\).  
Some activities are ‘risky’ by their very nature, some activities or elements are sim-  
ply inappropriate, and there may be some dangers inherent in an activity that would  
suggest its prohibition, yet this is not always known or heeded by event producers or

Reception theme causes controversy  
August 7, 1999\: The welcome reception for an international association’s annual conference held  
in Washington D.C. began with hors d’oeuvre and wine at one of the city’s museums, after  
which attendees were loaded onto motor coaches for what was advertised as an opportunity to  
see the sights of the nation’s capital. Once on board, attendees were told that not everything they  
saw that evening would be as it appeared to be. After driving past a couple of national monu-  
ments the motor coaches seemed to be taking a detour due to construction, finally turning onto  
a dark street with police cars at the entrance. As the coaches stopped in front of a darkened ware-  
house lateral fireworks exploded, shooting sparks and loud bangs like gunfire, and several peo-  
ple dressed in camouflage clothing and masks barged onto the bus brandishing machine guns  
\(actually water pistols\) and claiming they were taking the passengers hostage. Although this  
arrival was meant to enhance the ‘urban extreme’ theme the party designers had developed and  
most attendees quickly realized this was part of the entertainment, quite a few were traumatized  
by the incident and had to be transported back to the hotel immediately. In their enthusiasm to  
create a ‘cutting edge’ experience the event organizers had forgotten to make certain the experi-  
ence was clearly identifiable as ‘theater’ and not reality. They were forced to make a public 8 ol-  
ogy for their choices at the opening session of the conference the next morning ; ; a "\#ERERERD C. Stitt.\)

planners. For example, the popular Sumo Wrestler game, wherein the participants don  
a padded suit and wrestle each other, has caused serious spinal injuries and death and  
has been the subject of lawsuits, with multi-million dollar settlements awarded to vic-  
tims of such injuries. Yet, this attraction is still offered by numerous interactive game  
providers and ordered by many event organizers because it is not legally banned. The  
event risk manager must continually scan the event industry for such hazards and  
dangers. One cannot rely solely on a provider’s assurances of safety.  
Structure and sequencing  
Once the menu of activities or event components has been selected, these must be  
structured and sequenced in such a way that a balanced, logical, and progressive  
experience is delivered. The location and duration requirements for each activity  
must be determined, the positioning of contiguous and concurrent event elements  
must be established, and the sequence of event elements must be arranged in an  
agenda, running order, schedule, or itinerary that has continuity and reflects the  
appropriate pace and tempo.  
The program agenda or structure should be arranged so that the attendee will move  
through the experience in the proper order or flow \(as designed\) and is able to take full  
advantage of the individual elements as the attendee so chooses. Flow planning is  
important from an experiential as well as risk management perspective. For example,  
groups of 1000 or more require a minimum of 30 minutes to move from one room to  
another, such as from a plenary session to individual breakout sessions at a convention  
or from a reception into dinner at a banquet, and sufficient time must be allotted to  
ensure crowd movement problems do not emerge. Special attention must be paid to  
those activities or elements that will be in high demand to ensure these are not sched-  
uled or positioned in such a way that the attendee will be forced to make an unwelcome  
choice or that capacity or crowd density restrictions are compromised. The risk man-  
ager should scan the program structure and sequencing to ascertain any conflicts that  
could cause problems. In addition, various vendors and suppliers will be contracted to  
provide the event activities and services. Each will have a set of needs and expectations  
that must be assessed in order to identify and control any associated risks. These  
requirements may include, but are not limited to, those shown in Table 10.3.  
Effective design and delivery of the event experience relies on a threshold-to-  
threshold vision from the attendee’s, participant’s, and provider’s perspective. The  
activities included must be scrutinized to ensure they enhance the purpose of the  
event. The event dates and schedule must accommodate the logistical needs and pref-  
erences of all those involved. An experience is the sum total of the features and facets

included; it is an integrated package. Failure to recognize this holistic nature could  
cause exposures to potential hazards, vulnerabilities, and disappointment.  
Designing the environment  
The setting in which the meeting or event occurs must meet the needs of its occu-  
pants as well as facilitate the achievement of the purpose for the event \(e.g., learning,  
marketing, ceremonial, hospitality, entertainment, etc.\). The selection and arrange-  
ment of décor items, props, furnishings, decorative embellishments, and wayfind-  
ing systems should enhance the attractiveness and functionality of the event  
environment. The designer must recognize and understand the effects of the envi-  
ronmental stimuli on the responses and behavior of the occupants, and seek to  
achieve a synergy between the physical, perceptual, and social aspects of the setting  
\(Gifford, 2002\). The factors that influence the occupant’s reactions to the environ-  
ment are shown in Table 10.4, which should be considered by the event designer  
from the esthetic, kinetic, behavioral, comfort, and safety perspective. The risk man-  
ager should consider these as well, but must look deeper into the proposed layout,  
construction, and installation of the environment’s elements in order to reveal  
potential hazards, some of which are shown in Table 10.5.  
Use of an event site will have an impact on that site, particularly sites or venues  
that are not purpose built. Careful attention must be paid to make certain the nega-  
tive impacts of site usage are minimized as much as possible. Controlling damage,  
pollution, and waste will not only protect the environment; it will reduce the  
risks, financial and physical, associated with using a site or venue. As noted in  
Chapter 3, the event may be required to adhere to specific environmental protection  
regulations or codes, particularly with regard to public-owned lands or waterways  
and event activities or elements that might have a negative impact on them.

Configuration and decoration  
The physical configuration and decoration of the event setting will be based upon  
the audience in attendance and the activities to be conducted. These environments  
should be designed in such a way that they enhance performance and encourage  
desired behavior. The layout and use of space should be established in such a way  
that it meets social and physical requirements within the confines of the setting con-  
ditions and restrictions. The risk manager should evaluate the décor and site or lay-  
out plan to ensure the following audience needs are carefully considered in terms of  
creating the appropriate functional environment and the hazards or vulnerabilities  
associated with them.  
¢ Access\: roads and parking, disability accessibility, entrances, passageways.

Potentially hazardous party design  
A large high-tech company hired an event designer from New Orleans to produce a Mardi  
Gras-themed employee appreciation party for 3000 staged in the main exhibit hall of the con-  
vention center. The exhibit hall was a vast rectangular space with a diagonal bank of doors at  
one corner. The designer decided to section the hall into four theme areas \(Bayou, Riverboat,  
Plantation, and Mardi Gras\) with a winding pathway \(through the French Quarter\) from the  
entrance to an intersection to the four areas, all of which was created using false walls of drap-  
ing, backdrops, massive props, and facades. Low intensity lighting was used to make the  
height of the cavernous hall disappear, selective spot lighting was used to highlight the theme  
props, buffet displays, and entertainment stages, and smoke effects covered the ugly cement  
floors with a ‘swamp’ fog. The effect was stunning. Guests would immediately enter an  
altered reality as they snaked their way through the streets of the French Quarter and wan-  
dered through the four areas enjoying a variety of theme environments and big-name enter-  
tainment. It was also a disaster waiting to happen.  
The designer had covered virtually all the fire exits with draping and stages, including putting  
a main entertainment stage in front of the diagonal bank of doors, which, because these led  
directly outside, were the main means of egress for the exhibit hall. Although the convention cen-  
ter had a policy of requiring a floor plan for fire marshal approval four weeks prior to the event,  
the event designer ‘conveniently’ forgot to submit one and the convention center staff never fol-  
lowed up. When the six trucks of props and décor from New Orleans arrived, loaded in, and were  
installed, the fire marshal deemed the layout unacceptable. The convention center staff pleaded  
with the fire marshal for a way to proceed with this very expensive \(and lucrative\) event. i  
248 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
The center received a violation citation from the fire marshal, paper ‘Exit’ signs had to be  
attached to the décor throughout the space, and a small army of firefighters had be paid for to  
be on-site to direct human traffic should anything go wrong. But had a fire broken out, panic  
would have rendered those firefighters next to useless. The reality would have been 3000 pan-  
icked people trying to push and shove their way out of a very crowded, smoky, pany lit, com-  
pletely confusing layout, with virtually no way of distinguishing where Out was.  
Fortunately, no such disaster occurred. It is doubtful that the host company had any idea of  
the serious jeopardy their guests \(their employees\) were put in because this is something they  
would have never allowed at their place of business.  
The goals of effective layout, according to Tum, Norton, and Wright \(2006\), consist  
of optimizing movement, reducing congestion, and maximizing the use of space.  
Bowdin et al. \(2006\) note the relationship of the event’s schedule with flow planning,  
citing peak flow periods in the agenda of activities as a movement-capability safety  
factor. Facilitating safe crowd movement, minimizing actual and perceived conges-  
tion, and choreographing the flow through the space can be enhanced or impeded  
by the placement of activity, décor, and staging elements. Space usage for logistical  
activities must also be considered, including any maintenance, replenishment, and  
storage requirements, all of which may also be facilitated with proper spatial plan-  
ning. The development of an accurate floor plan or site plan should be of particular’  
interest to the risk manager so that functional \(and regulatory\) accessibility is  
assured and crowd density is controlled.  
Gifford \(2002\) points out, however, that crowding and density are distinct; crowd-  
ing is subjective \(a perception\) and density is objective \(a physical actuality\). These  
relate to personal space preferences, which vary according to cultural and environ-  
mental factors, as well as the social context of the event. In addition, density can inten-  
sify the positive or negative magnitude of whatever is occurring \(e.g., increasing either  
pleasure or dissatisfaction\), which suggests that, with all safety implications consid-  
ered, establishing high density situations may be preferable for certain event activities.  
Décor, furnishings, and staging  
Numerous challenges and opportunities may be approached through décor strategies.  
Movement can be choreographed, interaction can be encouraged, visibility can be  
enhanced, and hazards can be obstructed. For example, a corporation held a company  
party with a nautical theme at a water park but did not want guests to go swimming  
in the wave pool due to liability and ‘proper’ dress concerns, so the designer cordoned  
off the perimeter of the pool using wharf pylons with life savers and rope lines as  
theme décor. Many events will use color-coded decorations or different themes to  
identify different activities and activity zones. Stages, platforms, and other equipment  
are often used to enhance visibility and focus attention on specific activities or features.  
Scenery and draping offers numerous ways to conceal anything from storage areas  
to undesirable architectural features to potentially hazardous apparatus.  
The event designer has unlimited possibilities regarding methods and materials  
for decorating an event space, and choices are often made according to creative  
inspiration, theme, cost, and equipment availability. Countless decorators gather  
inspiration anywhere from theatrical productions to hardware stores, and will see  
and use materials in atypical and unique ways. This often provides extraordinary LL SSS sss sess rset  
Program design 249  
and exciting environments in which the event activities take place, but also poses  
numerous risk issues unless the designer has made certain that the characteristics,  
construction, and installation of these decorations have been fully assessed for safety  
and can be achieved in the specific event context.  
Appropriate tables, seating, and other furnishings must be acquired and positioned  
according to the activities to be conducted, and must ensure suitable sight lines are  
maintained for both the focus of attention and the means of egress. Here, again, there  
are countless creative options for equipment types, materials, and configuration, which  
must be constructed, positioned, and assigned with safety in mind. For example,  
using atypical materials for tables or chairs may make them unstable or they may  
have unsafe edges or surfaces, and seating assignments would be important from a  
risk management perspective for competitive sports events due to rivalries or cere-  
monial events due to protocol or security requirements.  
Most event elements or components require the availability or importation of spe-  
cialized equipment. This may include aerial apparatus or audiovisual devices, special  
seating or shelters, props or production equipment, tents or toilets, stages or stoves,  
grandstands or garment racks, packing cases or platforms, lighting instruments or  
installation lifts. The risk manager must know what equipment is to be used, where  
it is coming from \(in-house or imported\), where it is going, who will be operating it,  
and any inherent safety hazards associated with it. This includes all the equipment  
needed to support the activity, perform the activity, install the activity, protect the  
activity, and remove the activity or attraction. What should be apparent is that the  
risk manager needs to know enough about every aspect of an event to be able to at  
least know which questions to ask to uncover potential risks. This is why it is critically  
important to include providers for every component of an event in the risk assessment  
process.  
Wayfinding systems  
Wayfinding, the science of personal navigation through a space, is pertinent not only to  
the comfort and enjoyment of the guest or attendee; it is critical to their safety and wel-  
fare, particularly in an emergency situation. It is important to provide environmental  
cues that facilitate navigation and spatial cognition and to develop signage systems that  
provide information, identification, orientation, and directions, and that enhance  
desired and/or required traffic flow. These cues and systems may be achieved with  
décor elements, furnishings, sensory cues, sensible layouts, and signage.  
Gifford \(2002\) cites the spatial cognition work of Kevin Lynch \(1960\), the origina-  
tor of the term wayfinding, referring to the legibility of an environment as reliant on  
clear paths, distinct edges, characteristic districts, and distinctive landmarks, and  
suggests that environmental cues such as signage, numbering, or color-coding sys-  
tems facilitate the comprehension and navigation of complex layouts. Foltz \(1998\)  
asserts that navigability, the ability to move from a current location to a destination  
even if the location of the destination is not precisely known, is enhanced by provid-  
ing unique location identities, orientation cues, well-structured paths, signage at  
decision points, and inviting sight lines to the attractions ahead.  
The signage needed to make navigating to and through the event site as easy as  
possible must be carefully considered. Signs can and should be integrated into the  
event environment and coordinated with the overall décor and theme of the event,  
which offers an excellent opportunity for sponsor recognition and event branding.  
Directional and informational signs are placed to facilitate the event attendee’s oT

comfort, minimize confusion, and manage behavior. In addition, as noted in  
Chapter 8, advisory or warning signs are used to communicate important safety  
messages, restrictions, and instructions. Signs must be easy to read and understand,  
which may require symbols or pictographic icons as well as alternate formats for  
varying abilities and disabilities, and they must be positioned wherever they will  
help the guest navigate and enjoy the event \(see Table 10.6\).  
Food and beverage service  
Food and beverages are often a key component of events ranging from the simplest  
water station at a meeting, to the concessions at a festival or stadium event, to a lav-  
ish banquet for heads of state, incentive event, or a wedding dinner. Managing food  
service and beverage service encompasses the determination of suitable catering  
operations and the selection of the menus, quantities, and service styles to meet the  
food and beverage needs of the event, including the specific requirements associated  
with the serving of alcohol. As discussed in Chapter 4, safe food service is a primary  
concern for the risk manager, including the prevention of illness and injuries. The  
issues surrounding food service are shown in Figure 10.4 and the typical risks asso-  
ciated with food and beverage service are shown in Table 10.7.  
Food and beverage service is often procured from an on-premise caterer, off-  
premise caterer, or concession operation, and the capabilities and constraints will  
determine the most suitable provider for the event project. On-premise and off-  
premise catering operations have very different requirements and logistics. A fully  
equipped kitchen facility will likely be available at an on-premise location, but will  
need to be imported \(or foods must be transported\) for an off-premise location.  
Temporary kitchens must be properly situated, constructed, and staffed.  
Contracting and communications with a catering organization must be rigorously  
supervised. Catering or food service contracts should specify the date, time, and Program design 251

In order to select a suitable and sufficient menu for an event project the requirements  
for meal, refreshment, and beverage services must be determined and quantities must  
be calculated. Various attendee, participant, staff, and other stakeholder groups may se

have different nutritional requirements as well as menu preferences that need to be  
incorporated into the menu planning, which becomes more complex if the meeting  
or event runs over several days. In addition, one must consider special needs such as  
dietary restrictions and perhaps political issues. Religious dietary laws \(Kosher,  
Halal, caste-specific Hindu diets, etc.\), physical conditions \(allergies, gluten intoler-  
ance, etc.\), and philosophical convictions \(vegetarians, animal rights activists, envi-  
ronmentalists, etc.\) may require specific food items, ingredients, or preparation  
methods be included or excluded.  
Service planning consists of specifying the serving style and timing, determining  
the appropriate room setup, identifying the necessary staffing and equipment, and  
integrating this into the site plans and scheduling. Off-premise and temporary cater-  
ing sites typically have more service planning considerations, but all sites and serv-  
ice providers have vulnerabilities and potential hazards that the risk manager  
should be on the lookout for, some of which are shown in Table 10.8.  
Alcohol management  
Studies have indicated that the number one risk management concern is the serving  
of alcohol at events. However, this is only relative to certain types of events and  
event audiences. Serving cocktails and wine at a conservative or formal occasion is  
completely different than selling alcohol at a large sporting competition with rowdy  
fans. Nevertheless, the risk manager must always remember that alcohol can change  
the nature of the audience. Alcohol consumption can cause reasonable and well-  
behaved individuals to abandon their typical social mores and controls, resulting in  
an audience or crowd that is more dangerous or difficult to control.  
Effective management of alcohol service requires the identification and compli-  
ance with alcohol service policies and laws, determining and addressing liabilities  
and insurance requirements, and incorporating responsible consumption programs. ee eee  
Program design 253  
Most communities and governments strictly control the serving of alcoholic bever-  
ages through a regulatory entity \(e.g., Alcohol Beverage Commissions \(ABC\) in the  
U.S.\) that is responsible for licensing and regulating the sale of alcohol. Regulations  
often cover such things as prohibiting the sale of liquor to persons under a certain  
age or to intoxicated persons, the hours of operation, the licenses and insurance  
required, liquor pricing, and the amounts or types of liquor that may be served. In  
addition, alcohol service will be governed by the same health codes applicable to all  
other food and beverage service.  
Many jurisdictions also require specific training be provided to all those selling  
and serving alcohol, particularly as laws such as the dram shop and social-host laws  
in the U.S. impose liability on both the individual consuming the alcohol and the one  
serving it. Even if not mandated, server training is a sound risk management tactic.  
Alcohol server training typically covers signs of intoxication, dealing with intoxi-  
cated guests, dealing with minors, the effects of alcohol on the body, and local liquor  
codes. Responsible drinking initiatives, promotions, and policies are often adopted  
by event organizations \(and may be required in certain jurisdictions\), which may  
include designated driver programs, subsidized taxi or shuttle service, and on-site  
advisory or educational signage at the event.  
Consider this... 10.3  
Two receptions cause over consumption  
An hour and a half opening reception for an association meeting held at the meeting hotel  
included a cash bar for which attendees were given a limited number of drink coupons to  
exchange for the beverages of their choice, and all went well. On the same night, however,  
a major hotel-sponsored event was held in the hotel’s lobby for the hotel guests and commu-  
nity, including the hotel’s corporate executives and the city’s top elected officials. This four-  
hour reception included terrific food stations, music, and hotel staff delivering specialty  
martinis, champagne, and other drinks to anyone who wanted them and the entire bar was  
open and complimentary \(hosted\). Many of the association’s attendees went down to the hotel  
reception after the association’s reception instead of going out to dinner.  
An attendee and two colleagues from the same office were among the meeting participants in  
the hotel lobby. One of these attendees proceeded to get extremely drunk at the hotel’s event.  
\(It was not known how much they had drunk at the association’s reception prior to joining the  
hotel's festivities, but they did not ‘appear’ to be drunk when they left that function.\) Hotel secu-  
rity attempted to cut off service to this participant who proceeded to become enraged. The police  
were called in and the participant \(from outside the U.S., the host country\) was eventually  
arrested and arraigned on multiple counts of felonious assault. The arrested person and col-  
leagues wanted assistance from the association in terms of bail, contacting lawyers, etc., but the  
association refused to provide this. The association is now considering development of some  
sort of ‘attendee code of conduct’ to prevent such incidents at future events, including changes  
to their bylaws to give them the ability to impose disciplinary action toward a member in this  
kind of situation.  
Access to alcohol should be controlled through the segregation of service and/or  
consumption areas \(e.g., alcohol-free seating sections\), limits on serving times \(e.g.,  
closing the bar prior to the end of the event\), use and enforcement of identification 254 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
credentials \(e.g., wrist bands\), use of portion controls \(e.g., serving size limits\),  
prohibition of bring-your-own or self-service operations \(e.g., unattended beer kegs\),  
and sufficient deployment of security personnel. Non-alcoholic beverage options  
should always be included when serving alcohol and food should also be available,  
even if it is only hors d’oeuvre or snacks \(avoiding salty items because they increase  
thirst\). Free drinking water must be provided at any event. Bottom line\: give the  
guest plenty of options NOT to drink to intoxication.  
# Entertainment  
The event organizer or designer in charge of entertainment oversees the sourcing,  
selection, and control of suitable entertainment, ancillary programs, and recreational  
activities for the event project and the coordination of the support requirements for  
the entertainers and activities in a manner that delivers the desired entertainment  
experience and that benefits the audience and organization. Everything from acro-  
bats to Zydeco bands has been included as entertainment for events. Event audiences  
have enjoyed attractions from magic shows to extreme sports. Event attendees have  
participated in activities ranging from bungee jumping to war games and everything  
in between. And new entertainment acts and attractions are developed everyday.  
Some acts and activities are inherently or potentially more risky than others,  
but the risk manager does not encourage or discourage any particular entertainment  
attraction or performer. He or she assesses the risk and makes recommendations that  
will help avoid, reduce, or transfer those risks if the entertainment choices have been  
made. However, the risk manager can and should identify and clearly communicate  
potential hazards and vulnerabilities \(see Table 10.9\) so that organizers are able to  
incorporate the appropriate safeguards \(and perhaps reconsider the choices if possi-  
ble\), and unsafe entertainment attractions should be forcefully opposed.  
Selecting entertainers, attractions, and elements  
In order to select effective and appropriate entertainment elements for a meeting or  
event one must determine the purpose and objectives of including entertainment  
and attractions in the event program; the type and style of and suitable options for  
entertainment products, performers, and services must be identified; and the scope,  
schedule, and location of entertainment activities and attractions must be established.  
Table 10.9 Typical risk areas for entertainment  
Amateur entertainment groups

Close proximity performers

Music licensing and recording rights  
Non-appearance or cancellation

Program design 255  
The organizer must then identify the agents, promoters, and other sources for enter-  
tainment and attractions, and book the entertainers using clear and comprehensive  
contracts or engagement agreements.  
The risk manager should always check for and assess the selection criteria to be  
used in order to reveal potential problems. Reliance on assumptions, personal prefer-  
ences, or one group’s definition of good taste may lead to unsatisfactory or unsavory  
choices. For example, an organizing committee member’s engagement of seven strip-  
pers for a 45-minute burlesque routine \(which was stopped after about 10 minutes\) as  
‘light-hearted’ dinner entertainment for a government-sponsored conference in  
Canberra, Australia, outraged attendees, prompted withdrawal of conference spon-  
sorship funding, and triggered calls for a government investigation \(Murray, 2006\).  
Budget and availability of options will often dictate some choices; site capabilities  
and logistical operations will prescribe others. The host or organizers may wish to  
include celebrity or headliner entertainment, but the costs for the entertainer’s fee  
plus the costs and logistics associated with the travel, hospitality, security, and stag-  
ing requirements included in the entertainer’s contract rider may exceed the finan-  
cial and operational resources of the event. ‘Big-name’ entertainment may increase  
attendance and attract commercial sponsors, but often entails big production obliga-  
tions that inexperienced organizers are unaware of and unprepared to implement,  
and increases the importance of non-appearance or cancellation coverage. Amateur  
or semi-professional entertainment is often a viable choice because these performers  
are typically no less talented than professional entertainers, but are sometimes less  
aware of expected behavior, especially in regard to entourages of family and friends.  
Careful attention must be paid to the probable demand on specific performers or  
attractions such as close proximity performers \(e.g., strolling magicians or musicians\)  
and amenity attractions \(e.g., caricaturists or photo stations\) to ensure queues are  
manageable and the entertainers are not put in jeopardy. Environmental entertainers  
\(e.g., costumed characters\) need to be positioned properly within the site plan and  
schedule, must be given clear instructions regarding their role and scope of interac-  
tion with the audience \(any costumed characters meant to interact with children must  
be properly screened with background checks\), and the costume should not infringe  
Consider this... 10.4  
National anthems\: politically powerful music  
Event organizers have caused embarrassment, suspicion, outrage, confrontations, diplomatic  
protests, and ill will by playing the wrong national anthem at ceremonies at rival-intense  
events such as a 1999 goodwill rugby match in Japan and a Rugby Union match in Italy in 2001,  
the Mountainbike World Cup in 2002, a judo championship held in Vietnam in 2003 and the  
2005 Taekwondo World Cup Championships in Madrid, the 2003 Davis Cup Final in Australia  
and the 2004 World Hockey Championships in the Czech Republic, the 2004 African Cup of  
Nations soccer championships in Tunisia, and the FIFA soccer World Cup held in Germany in  
2006. Offended participants and national delegations have demanded official and public apolo-  
gies, departed the field in protest, insisted that new ceremonies be conducted, and withdrawn  
financial support for future events. These music mistakes have disgraced event organizers  
and their countries, not to mention the aggravation of fierce national rivalries and the potential  
for crowd endangerment such incidents engender. oo  
256 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
on any trademarked imagery or protected likeness restrictions \(e.g., celebrity look-  
alikes\). Live and recorded music is employed for many events for many reasons and  
both live and recorded music usage must comply with music licensing regulations.  
Performer and performance requirements  
Once the entertainment has been selected and contracted, the event organizer needs  
to make certain the entertainers are able to give the best performance possible by  
meeting their needs. This includes the determination and integration of production  
and logistical requirements into the site and operational plans \(including technical  
and performer rehearsals\), arranging accommodations \(e.g., housing and on-site  
facilities\) as necessary, and ensuring contractual fulfillment of hospitality and tech-  
nical rider requirements. The scope of this responsibility is directly related to the  
scale of the entertainment program. Ambitious entertainment programs often  
require the services of a production coordinator or stage manager, and should prob-  
ably not be undertaken without engaging such professionals.  
As Bowdin et al. \(2006\), Silvers \(2004a\), and Sonder \(2004\) note, performers may  
come from widely divergent cultural and contextual backgrounds with varying lev-  
els of performing experience, which often results in misunderstandings concerning  
expectations on the part of both parties — the entertainer and the event organizer. The  
risk manager should work closely with the organizer to ensure that explicit expecta-  
tions of entertainers and entertainment personnel are specified and closely moni--  
tored. Limitations and prohibitions \(or requested inclusions\) regarding performer  
behavior, content, interaction, and/or amenities \(e.g., buffet or bar access, lounge  
areas, etc.\) must be clearly communicated and included in contracts as appropriate.  
These, however, must be acceptable within the context of union or other regulatory  
requirements \(e.g., minimum hours, minimum number of musicians, etc.\), and  
accepted via informed consent by the performer \(e.g., do not wait to tell the band  
that their entourage is not welcome after they have all arrived on site\).  
Ancillary and recreational activities  
Many events, meetings and conventions in particular, include a selection of ancillary  
programs and recreational activities such as companion programs, children’s pro-  
grams and services, pre- and post-event and side tours, contests and competitions,  
sports tournaments, and other athletic activities that are held in conjunction with the  
main event program. The risk manager should pay particular attention to children’s  
programs and sports activities. Children’s programs must adhere to the strict con-  
trols typically imposed on childcare endeavors, which may require specific licenses  
or credentialing in certain jurisdictions. Certain athletic activities are inherently or  
potentially perilous, often the very reason they are attractive to the adventurous,  
and vigorous or strenuous sports can result in injuries and other medical complica-  
tions for those less experienced or physically fit.  
These programs require special attention to liability issues and insurance require-  
ments, including provision of on-site medical services as appropriate and securing  
waivers of indemnity signed by participants. It is advisable, however, not to include  
dangerous activities in the formal event program so that there is no connection between  
the provider/partaker and the event organization. Any and all ancillary programs and  
services should be procured only from appropriate and qualified providers, and should  
be incorporated into the insurance policies for the event and event organization. Program design 257  
Production elements  
Production elements, including lighting, sound, projection, and special effects, are  
added to many \(if not most\) events to enhance the event environment, the event  
experience, and the event's effectiveness. Whilst the incorporation, sourcing, selection,  
and positioning of these theatrical elements and services are considered by event  
organizers from a decorative or dramatic perspective, they must be assessed by risk  
managers from a safety and audience welfare perspective \(see Table 10.10\) as well as  
from a risk reduction perspective since many of them can and should be used to sup-  
port the risk response plan. For example, lighting can highlight paths of egress,  
sound systems will be used for emergency announcements, and projection screens  
can be used to transmit variable safety messages.  
Audio, visual, and multimedia technology  
As with any aspect of the event or program design, there are countless audio and  
visual options for the event organizer to choose from to create the event experience.  
Some are selected for purely functional reasons; others for adding the theatrical  
dimension that enhances the impact. Both the event organizer and risk manager  
must understand the scope, capabilities, and limitations of the technology in order  
to select the equipment, services, and service providers that will meet the require-  
ments for the activities to be conducted and assess the potential risks and risk man-  
agement possibilities associated with each element \(see Figure 10.5\).  
Lighting is used to illuminate a space, in both a decorative fashion and to provide  
the illumination needed to create a safe environment. The placement and intensity of  
the lighting can attract or distract attention. The absence of lighting or sufficient illu-  
mination can cause problems with crowd or individual mobility as well as lessening  
social control — in the dark you can be anonymous. The requirements for positioning  
lighting fixtures and equipment must be determined in order to achieve the effects  
desired, provide the illumination necessary for the tasks or activities to be con-  
ducted, and ensure that the equipment does not pose any safety hazards \(e.g., falling  
fixtures, tripping over equipment legs, etc.\).  
Sound augmentation allows the audience to hear the sounds at an event, includ-  
ing the presentation, the entertainment, soundscaping opportunities, and especially  
any important announcements. The decibel level of the sound can be a hazard, both  
physically to the individual \(ie., damage to hearing\) and to the event if subject to  
noise ordinances that prohibit the disturbance of surrounding neighbors or areas. If  
recording elements for future broadcast or products \(e.g., webcasts, conference CDs,  
etc.\), special attention must be paid to ensuring the recording equipment and levels

Welfare  
Figure 10.5 The dimensions of audiovisual considerations  
are sufficient and the proper permissions have been acquired. Projection equipment  
is used to make images and action visible from a distance, as well as to emphasize  
audible messages with visual reinforcement. Various projectors are able to magnify  
and display images and content on a broad variety of screens, from television mon-  
itors to screens the size of a building \(or even the sides of a building\).  
These elements must be examined from a safety viewpoint regarding their instal-  
lation requirements, the equipment used to create them, and the technicians who  
will operate them. Installation and operation should always be assigned to profes-  
sionals. The equipment can be potentially dangerous if mishandled \(or tampered  
with\), the installation and rigging of the equipment can be precarious if not done  
properly, and technical equipment can break down leaving the event in the dark and  
silent. Sufficient and accessible power sources must be provided to operate the  
equipment, and contingency plans must be devised to overcome outages or failures.  
Redundant equipment may be advisable. Sufficient time must be allotted for proper  
installation, rehearsals, and dismantling to prevent accidents.  
Special effects  
Special effects are the techniques and theatrical tricks that focus attention, add  
emphasis, and insert an element of surprise into the event program and environ-  
ment. As illustrated in Figure 10.6, special effects can include lasers, pyrotechnics,  
drops, launches, explosions, blasts, fog, and/or scentscaping, and the event organ-  
izer will evaluate and select the effects, techniques, and technology to enhance the  
program. However, from the risk management perspective, many special effects are  
inherently dangerous and most are potentially hazardous if mishandled and should Program design 259

Fire and smoke  
Figure 10.6 Typical special effects employed for events  
only be acquired from qualified providers. Additional costs or logistics for site  
preparation, delivery, installation, and clean up must also be considered. Silvers  
\(2004a, p. 263\) cautions that ‘everyone in the show needs to know.’ This caveat indicates  
the need to fully apprise all performers, providers, and production personnel of the  
scope and specifications of all planned special effects and demonstrates the ‘duty to  
warn’ principle for all involved in an event production.  
Laser lights and strobe lights can add exciting theatrical effects to an event  
program — BUT lasers can cause eye damage and both laser and strobe lights can  
trigger epileptic seizures and signs alerting audience members that such effects will  
be used must be posted. Confetti cannons can propel large confetti or small trinkets  
over 100 feet and confetti drops can shower guests with color and glitter - BUT the  
items or material propelled can get into people’s eyes, damage property, or contam-  
inate food and/or beverages if badly timed or aimed \(Silvers, 2004a\).  
Fog machines can fill the air with a misty smoke-like fog and dry ice will provide a  
fog that clings to the ground, providing a mystical or eerie atmosphere — BUT the  
materials used to create these and other atmospheric effects can cause burns \(e.g., liq-  
uid nitrogen and dry ice\) and could deplete the oxygen in the adjacent space or dis-  
perse particulates into the air, which may affect asthmatics, and the fragrances used in  
these and scentscaping effects can affect those with allergies \(Rossol, 2000\). Even the  
ubiquitous balloon has potential hazards ranging from the helium tanks used for infla-  
tion to the flammability and electricity conductivity of foil balloons \(Monroe, 2006\).  
Indoor or outdoor pyrotechnics and aerial displays provide an exciting introduc-  
tion, emphasis, or finale —- BUT they can be fire hazards \(burning people and prop-  
erty\) and are strictly controlled in most jurisdictions. These restrictions regulate  
where the pyrotechnics may be detonated, how large they may be, how far away I  
260 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
from the audience they must be, and what level of security and fire watch personnel  
must be provided \(NFPA 1123, 2000; NFPA 160, 2001; NFPA 1126, 2001\). They typi-  
cally require a permit be issued based upon a pyrotechnics plan that illustrates the  
proposed use is ‘safe and compatible with respect to the audience, performers, sup-  
port personnel, pyrotechnicians, activity, stage, ceiling height, ventilation and  
venue’ \(Explosives Regulatory Division, 2003, p. 10\). Some jurisdictions and venues  
may prohibit pyrotechnics of any sort altogether, including displays and close-  
proximity pyrotechnic or flame effects. One need only recall the horrific nightclub  
tragedy in West Warwick, Rhode Island in February 2003 to realize the consequences  
of mishandling pyrotechnics.  
\(ol akiie \(=\) anda\] Seen LO Mos  
Sparkling centerpieces  
Pyrotechnic centerpieces that shoot off a shower of sparks on cue have become a popular close  
proximity effect used at banquets \(although these devices are prohibited in many jurisdic-  
tions\). The provider of these centerpieces at one banquet encountered an ancillary hazard. He  
had procured the appropriate permits and had rigorously checked the safety of the equipment  
and the radio-controlled detonation apparatus for the centerpiece devices. The effect went off  
perfectly as he ignited the centerpieces on cue, providing an exciting climax for the event. Not  
long after the pyrotechnics went off, however, the provider heard the sirens of the fire trucks  
approaching the venue. He was confused because nothing had gone wrong with the devices  
at the banquet; everything was fine. He went outside to determine what caused the fire fighter  
response and saw his car completely engulfed in flames. Being the conscientious provider he  
was, he had brought several extra centerpiece appliances in case one of the centerpieces was  
damaged. But he had forgotten to disconnect the detonator on those extra devices and when  
he triggered the centerpieces for the banquet, the radio signal also ignited the ones in his car.  
# Summary  
Crafting an event experience is blend of creativity and practicality, of art and disci-  
pline. The list of options and possibilities available to the event designer is vast and  
expanding exponentially as exciting techniques, technologies, and theatrical innova-  
tions enter the meetings and events marketplace everyday. This array of artistic  
choices must be managed through a disciplined approach in order to select the most  
effective activities and attributes for the environmental, experiential, and opera-  
tional dimensions of that occasion, as well as the safety of their usage.  
The event environment may be shaped and developed with décor, staging, pres-  
entation equipment, production elements, and furnishings. It must serve the needs  
of the event audience by providing the ambiance, equipment, shelter, and services  
that facilitate the appropriate learning, communication, entertainment, or celebra-  
tory event experience while ensuring the health, safety, welfare, and comfort of those  
in attendance \(including those there to create, operate, or participate in the event\).  
Provision of proper signage provides the cues and assistance to ensure the event  
experience will be as designed or preferentially desired, and should be used to  
prevent accidents, confusion or disorientation, inappropriate behavior, and access to  
restricted or hazardous areas. Lest esses iim nme

Virtually all events include food and beverage service in some fashion, varying  
according to scope and function type. Any type or level of food and beverage serv-  
ice must be considered from a sanitation perspective to protect the health of those  
consuming these products, and the capabilities and credentials of the providers of  
these products must be confirmed. The event risk manager must employ the neces-  
sary strategies and policies to mitigate the risks associated with serving alcohol, as  
well as make certain that the appropriate and sufficient liability insurance is secured  
or in place for the event organization, the host, and the purveyor.  
Entertainment, attractions, activities, and theatrical features add to enjoyment lev-  
els but must be assessed for appropriateness and potential liabilities, as well as the  
logistical requirements that will need to be incorporated throughout the operational  
plans. Magic \(or a magical experience\) does not just happen; it always requires some  
level of infrastructure that, in itself, poses potential hazards, vulnerabilities, and lia-  
bilities. The risk manager must work with the event organizer or designer to approach  
these choices as a risk technician rather than a risk taker.  
Key safeguards  
¢ Scan the program agenda for potentially controversial or high-demand components.  
e Temporary structures or staging elements require special attention to ensure their  
stability and compliance with safety regulations.  
¢ Confirm that all exit and safety signage has not been obscured by décor or  
decorations.  
¢ Require a floor or site plan that is accurate in scale for every event.  
¢ Never allow alcoholic beverages to be self-service.  
e Amateur and professional speakers and entertainers should be held to the same  
high safety and accountability standards.  
e Ensure appropriate sound amplification systems and sufficient functional, task,  
and safety lighting are provided.  
e Invest in redundant equipment for critical production equipment and a technical  
director or producer for large or complex productions.  
e Every special effect comes with potential hazards and should always be installed  
and operated by professionals.

# exercise  
You have been retained by the CEO of the We Own Everything Corporation \(WEOC\)  
to develop a single alcohol management policy for its events department, which  
coordinates approximately 500 events annually throughout the nation. These events  
include management meetings, conferences, product launch events, company  
picnics, awards banquets, training programs, incentive travel programs, and cus-  
tomer hospitality events at numerous trade shows and sports events that the corpo-  
ration sponsors. The CEO does not wish to prohibit the serving of alcohol at the  
corporation’s events, but wants a policy that can be uniformly applied and enforced  
at all the corporate events so that there will be consistency in its approach to the  
serving of alcohol and will reflect sound risk management strategies that limit its  
liability.  
Your job is to research regulatory requirements and best practices in alcohol man-  
agement and write a 10-point policy that would be suitable for all of the events  
organized by the events department \(e.g., any event hosted by the WEOC where  
alcohol is served shall use the services of a bartender certified through an alcohol  
server training program for the dispensing of alcohol\), and justify your reeommen-  
dations citing a minimum of three reference resources.

# Introduction  
Every event occurs somewhere. An event site is the stage on or place in which the  
event experience will take place. The event site must accommodate the event atten-  
dees as well as the people, products, and services that will be brought together on-site  
to produce the event project. The management of the site must consider all the roles,  
responsibilities, applications, and maneuvers associated with these logistical and  
functional requirements and expectations as well as the experiential dimensions of the  
event's program as designed.  
Event organizers will be considering event sites from a capacity, capability, and mar-  
keting perspective. However, any potential event site or venue has strengths, weak-  
nesses, opportunities, and threats that must be addressed from a risk management  
perspective to ensure it serves the event audience, the event goals and objectives, and  
the event experience. The event organizer and risk manager must assess the spatial,  
infrastructural, and logistical attributes of the event and event site in order to assure  
feasibility. The predictive character of these attributes is shown in Table 11.1.

the old real-estate adage ‘location, location, location’ is equally applicable to select-  
ing the best location and venue for an event as it is for selecting a site for a new busi-  
ness. Events of all types have been staged indoors and outdoors, in purpose-built  
and temporary facilities, in museums and along city streets, at amusement parks OO  
266 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
and country clubs, on town squares and vacant lots, in convention centers and  
empty warehouses, and in stadiums and private homes. Locations can range from  
urban to remote and from local to distant and exotic destinations.  
The spatial capacity, costs, capabilities, features, suitability, and accessibility of a  
site will be used to determine feasibility. Selection will be based upon availability,  
affordability, and desirability from both a legal standpoint \(see Chapter 3\) and an  
operational standpoint. Once the event site has been acquired through a permit,  
build, or contract/lease arrangement, the event organizer and risk manager must  
become thoroughly familiar with the facility and its vicinity in order to be fully pre-  
pared for the production of the event. This includes the assessment of any and all  
hazards or vulnerabilities to ensure that risks may be mitigated.  
Site selection criteria  
Site selection is a pragmatic and sometimes intuitive process wherein the qualities  
and qualifications of the potential site are investigated, verified, and evaluated against  
the requirements and resources of the event. As with all procurement decisions \(see  
Chapter 7\), specifications must be established based on the needs assessment and  
weighted selection criteria must be developed according to priorities and the goals  
and objectives of the event project. Final site selection decisions may be made by the  
event organizer alone or in consultation with board members, clients, committees,  
executive directors, managers, and/or procurement departments. Use of pre-defined  
and weighted criteria helps prevent or remove any appearance of personal preference,  
favoritism, inducements, corruption, or political impropriety. Typical site selection  
criteria are shown in Table 11.2, and these criteria will vary in weight and applicability  
with each event according to its type, scale, and scope.  
Consider this... 11.1  
Vocation or vacation  
Although site selection for many meeting and conference events takes into consideration the  
prestige, luxurious features, or popular appeal of a destination in order to make it attractive to  
potential attendees \(sometimes including a conscious effort to induce linkage with a family  
vacation\), this criteria may backfire and become a political liability. Expensive or exotic meeting  
sites often come under public scrutiny when taxpayer money or budget money from non-profit  
agencies or public corporations is used to fund participation. Government officials and com-  
pany or agency executives or employees taking trips to resort areas and glamorous hotel prop-  
erties for meetings or conferences are often accused of squandering public dollars or misusing  
agency funds. This criticism, usually unfounded, illustrates that it is imperative to consider the  
target audience’s potential political vulnerabilities when establishing site selection criteria.  
It is widely recommended that a physical inspection of a potential event site be  
conducted prior to selection to qualify and quantify all standards and conditions.  
Additional venue-specific criteria may be assessed according to the event project’s  
special needs, as shown in Table 11.3. It is important to note that although a venue’s  
facilities, features, and personnel may be an asset or a liability, these may change cp a a ee ee ee

over time, which is likely to affect events that book space years in advance such as  
large meetings, expositions, and some incentive events. It is also important when  
considering a multi-use facility such as a hotel or convention center to determine  
other potential concurrent users to identify possible conflicts.  
Using a comprehensive site inspection checklist customized specifically for each  
event \(including key risk management categories as shown in Table 11.4\) will facili-  
tate the comparative evaluation of individual or numerous potential sites. In addi-  
tion, having such a checklist not only helps the organizer assess the suitability of the  
product or service under consideration, and thereby make decisions on what might  
or might not be additionally necessary to bring things up to their standards; such  
documentation shows attention to the important risk management issues, thereby  
reducing potential liability for ‘recommending incompetence.’  
Advancing the event production  
Once the event site has been selected and contracted, the event organizer and risk  
manager should concentrate on becoming completely familiar with the venue and its  
vicinity in order to determine the resources and services that will be used to produce  
the event, as well as those resources capable of mitigating or responding to unfavor-  
able conditions and incidents \(see Table 11.5\). This is sometimes referred to as advanc-  
ing the production \(Moxley, 1995\), and is particularly important if the event site is ina  
locale in which the organizer or risk manager does not reside. Telephone numbers,  
addresses, and driving directions should be collected for all those businesses that  
would be pertinent to the event project. It is also advisable to procure local and  
regional maps for any event destination and spend some time driving around the  
immediate vicinity of the event site or venue in order to familiarize oneself with the  
‘lay of the land.’  
! Contact should be made with all appropriate local authorities during this advanc-  
ing process to determine any special conditions or restrictions applicable to the  
event production or personnel. For example, in certain cities there may be curfews  
in some locations chewing gum or smoking in public is a criminal offense, and in enn

some countries there are restrictions on the amount of currency one may bring into or  
take out of the country \(Moxley, 1995\). These restrictions are well known and second  
nature to the residents and, therefore, may not come up in regular site negotiations, but  
they may have a significant impact on the event operations and in-bound audience.  
Assessing site hazards and vulnerabilities  
During an event, the event site will be filled with people, activities, equipment, and  
probably excitement. A pre-event inspection of the site should be conducted to  
determine potential hazards and vulnerabilities associated with the site and antici-  
pated activities and equipment, followed by similar inspections during set-up and  
throughout the event to monitor conditions. The initial inspection should reveal  
areas or items that must be addressed in the site layout and services provision plan-  
ning, including but not limited to those shown in Table 11.6. It is advisable to docu-  
ment pre-existing conditions by photograph or video just prior to set up and directly  
after move-out to document any damage caused by the event operations. i  
270 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
As opposed to the event organizer or designer, who will typically be focusing on the  
attributes and creative possibilities of the venue, the risk manager will be focusing on  
any and every aspect of the event site with an eye to what could go wrong. Although  
such negativity may be uncomfortable to others on the event team, this pessimistic per-  
spective is necessary and risk managers may need to conduct their inspections sepa-  
rately or temper the delivery of their reports or observations \(but not the content\) so  
that these concerns are properly addressed rather than dismissed. After all, most site  
hazards and vulnerabilities may be eliminated or mitigated with simple site planning  
tactics.  
Site planning and development  
Architect Louis Sullivan’s maxim ‘form follows function’ is a truism particularly  
pertinent to site planning for a meeting or event. As discussed in Chapter 10, the  
planned and likely choreography of the event experience will help shape the proper  
development and layout of the site wherein the event project takes place. Everything  
the guest or attendee will do and everything needed for them to do it must be  
arranged within the space given, and must be done in such a way that ensures the  
safety of all those occupying that particular space.  
Getz \(1997\) specifies that the key site planning principles include capacity, crowd  
management, queuing, traffic, and legibility, and stresses the importance of consid-  
ering access, movement, flow, shelter, comfort, and storage when developing the  
composition and configuration of the event site. Bowdin, Allen, O’Toole, Harris, and  
McDonnell \(2006\) highlight the importance of merging the schedule \(e.g., peak flow  
times\) and the product portfolio \(i.e., the scope of event elements and services\) in  
site planning. Silvers \(2004a\) underscores the importance of identifying and incor-  
porating spatial and proximity requirements. Fire safety and crowd management  
engineers study intra-event movement and egress flow capacity, and retail anthro-  
pologists and marketing consultants study consumer movement patterns. All this  
and more must be factored into development of a safe and effective layout that  
meets the needs of the event occupants and operations based upon the type of event,  
the features of the facility, the proposed activities, and the size of the audience.  
Activity determines site capacity and configuration  
What is supposed to happen within the site and when it is supposed to occur guides  
decisions on where activities and equipment should be placed. Getz \(1997\) proposes  
that activities may be characterized as assembly \(static audience\), procession \(linear  
attraction movement with static or linear audience movement\), linear-nodal \(linear  
attraction movement with audience congregation at nodes\), open space \(free move-  
ment with paths\), and exhibition \(planned circulation\). The distribution of activities  
and fixed or variable movement times must be integrated into the design of the lay-  
out to decrease queuing and congestion and reduce counter or cross flows, thereby  
enhancing flow capacity \(SFPE, 2002\). The physical dimensions of the activities and  
the movement of the audience will determine maximum occupancy capacity, not  
just the square footage \(or meters\) of the floor space. oe a  
Site management 271  
The risk manager should make certain that a minimum of 15 square feet \(1.4 square  
meters\) of net floor area is allotted per person in any site plan for egress capability  
and circulation space \(NFPA 101, 2000\). Sufficient aisle widths must be provided  
based on the expected crowd density and movement. Theater-style seating should  
have the chairs ganged \(hooked together\) to preserve row and aisle width integrity  
for maintaining egress flow capacity comparable to seating permanently fixed to the  
floor \(e.g., in actual theaters or auditoriums\). Sight lines must be assessed to ensure that  
ceiling heights can accommodate stage and screen heights based on flat floor seating  
capacity \(Jewell, 1978\) and that there is not movement toward the center causing con-  
gestion or crushing \(Standards South Africa, 2004\). Activities and concessions \(e.g.,  
attractions, food stations, bars, etc.\) should be positioned away from entry points and  
queuing areas should not obstruct entrances or other activities \(Silvers, 2004a; Standards  
South Africa, 2004\). Attraction priority and timing may also be important in the site lay-  
out design because high-demand activities and mass movements will require additional  
space allotment.  
Site development  
Most purpose-built facilities are fully equipped to meet the needs of most events;  
yet, many events still require the importation of equipment and services necessary  
to make a site capable of serving the requirements of the event operations and pro-  
gram. Outdoor or temporary venues will often require the importation of a partial or  
complete infrastructure including temporary structures, tenting, and mobile facilities  
in order to be fully functional. The event organizer and risk manager must anticipate  
the needs of the event audience and providers, and examine the venue’s resources  
in the context of event project as conceived.  
The overall site plan must consider and should segregate the audience areas \(front  
of house\) and the purely operational areas \(back of house\), and visual and physical  
barriers should be devised for restricted back of house areas \(Jewell, 1978\), including  
operational equipment installations sited within audience areas. Barriers should  
also be devised for potentially hazardous site features. For example, ditches along  
the entrance/exit path for an outdoor festival held at a rural sports field were fenced  
off using bright orange storm fencing to demarcate the route and prevent the crowds  
exiting after dark from straying too close to the drop off. Perimeters must be defined  
and controlled, event components and equipment must be positioned and protected,  
and medical and welfare services must be acquired and properly situated.  
Temporary structures and staging must be built, sited, and installed in compliance  
with applicable construction and engineering codes, which may entail an inspection by  
local authorities. Attention must be paid to acquiring the proper equipment according  
to spatial and load capacity, as well as its positioning within the site plan, including the  
quality \(e.g., gradient, load capacity\) of the surface where its installation is intended.  
Tents, marquees, towers \(e.g., AV or camera\), platforms, and portable seating typically  
require adherence to specific codes regarding fabrication, stability, anchoring practices  
for wind tolerance \(e.g., staking or water weights\), and usage \(NFPA, 1995\). Stage con-  
figurations should accommodate and segregate backstage facilities and may require  
barriers to prevent performer falls or crowd surges. Fire codes may govern how close  
tents may be sited together and the condition of their surroundings, the type and height  
of guard railings, or even the need for smoke detectors under expansive stages or  
grandstands. rE  
272 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Site diagrams  
Once all the event components and their spatial and proximity requirements have  
been determined, a diagram should be prepared that is comprehensive and accurate  
in scale in order to verify the configuration and circulation efficacy of the proposed  
layout. This diagram may be referred to as a site plan, floor plan, or site map, and  
should include all the architectural \(indoor\) and/or topographical \(outdoor\) features  
as well as the event-specific attractions and logistical features \(Bowdin et al., 2006\).  
The site diagram should be reviewed by the appropriate stakeholders \(e.g., suppli-  
ers and authorities\) to ensure that the crowd movement and logistical requirements  
have been properly addressed and that the layout facilitates the event experience as  
envisioned \(see Appendix M\: Site plan worksheet\).  
Site diagrams are an important part of the site development process in that the pro-  
posed distribution of activities, services, and equipment may be assessed and adjusted  
prior to the move-in, thereby saving time, money, and effort. Depending on the  
nature of the site or facility, the site diagram may need to include external features or  
the surrounding vicinity. Analysis of the diagram may reveal unforeseen health and  
safety hazards, security vulnerabilities, logistical nightmares waiting to happen, and  
gaps in infrastructural planning. Alternate forms of the diagram may be devised as  
communication tools such as travel access instructions, wayfinding maps, and seating  
charts.  
Infrastructure management  
Infrastructure may be defined as the utilities and technical support necessary to  
allow the event to operate at a given site, and its management encompasses the con-  
firmation, acquisition, or enhancement of inherent or imported equipment and serv-  
ices to ensure sufficient transportation systems, parking facilities, utilities, sanitation  
and waste management systems, and emergency response services are in place to  
meet the functional needs of the event project. Just as a city planner looks at the  
needs of residents to determine the city services necessary to conduct the business of  
everyday living, so too must the event organizer look at the needs of the temporary  
municipality created for the event.  
Varying levels of capacity and capability will be needed based on the type and  
scope of the event program, and varying levels will be found at purpose-built prop-  
erties, unique venues, temporary facilities, and completely undeveloped sites. The  
assessment of transportation systems and parking needs will be affected by the loca-  
tion of the event in relation to the location and size of its audience. The requirements  
for essential utilities and waste management services will be determined by the activi-  
ties to be conducted at the event. The provision of sanitation and emergency services  
will typically be calculated based on the nature and size of the audience and the  
duration of the event \(see Chapter 4\)  
Transportation and traffic issues  
The transportation and traffic issues surrounding an event will depend on the audi-  
ence size and market area; event site, time, and duration; and the type and scope of  
the event. The most common issues include modes of travel, traffic congestion, road i

tion; driving or riding to a venue at a destination; as well as getting around a desti-  
nation or an event site in a variety of conveyances \(see Figure 11.1\). Travel will be  
necessary for virtually any event but the type of event and its target market will typ-  
ically dictate the extent of travel and specific transportation issues that the event  
organizer and risk manager should consider, some of which are shown in Table 11.7.  
A traffic management plan should be developed in cooperation with the appropriate  
transportation, law enforcement, and public safety agency stakeholders and should  
address the following \(Latoski, Dunn, Wagenblast, Randall, and Walker, 2003\)\:

Conventions and conferences often include attendees from outside the vicinity of the

service capacity, and ground transportation operators for airport transfers, group  
transfers, or continuous shuttle services will be required for the high percentage of aA

visitors. Fair and festivals will typically include local residents and in-bound tourists,  
which would suggest that the roads and routes for private and rental cars and the capac-  
ity of public transportation should be carefully considered. Incentive events and high-  
level meetings may need to consider prestige or upscale transportation services such as  
chartered flights to remote locations or limousine service for VIPs and dignitaries.  
Expositions and trade shows will need to consider the truckloads of exhibits arriving at  
the exhibition hall and arts and craft fairs will need to consider the individual exhibitors  
arriving with their displays and inventory in individual vans and vehicles. Sports and  
other spectator events will need to consider travel demand management techniques  
such as enhancement of public transport, development of alternatives to \(and incentives  
against\) single-vehicle travel, and alternative or altered routes.  
Obviously street-use or on-road events such as parades, street fairs, or marathons  
will have a different set of considerations and traffic impact than events held in high-  
capacity purpose-built venues, and events that occur on the weekend will likely have  
different traffic conditions than those held during the week. It is the responsibility of  
the event organizer to assess the potential impact the event will cause on existing traf-  
fic and the impact the existing traffic will have on the event, including the entire dura-  
tion of the event’s operations from move-in through move-out, and then identify the  
stakeholders and strategies necessary to mitigate negative consequences. In addition,  
the risk manager should evaluate the incidents, conditions, or scenarios that might  
require transportation or traffic contingency plans, such as those shown in Table 11.8.  
Unimpeded access routes should be restricted and protected for emergency vehicles  
\(e.g., police, fire, ambulances, etc.\); exclusive and/or priority ingress and egress routes  
should be planned for busses, shuttle services, service vehicles, and preferential park-  
ing services; and in all cases, vehicular and pedestrian traffic should be segregated.  
\(fo\) akike \(=\) an aay era ie fe  
Half a good time was had  
A special off-premise event was planned for the delegates at an international convention held  
during a major hot air balloon festival, a signature event of the destination. The event organ-  
izer of this special event for the convention had procured a special hospitality tent within the 276 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
festival’s corporate village featuring a fantastic gourmet breakfast buffet for the 800 guests  
who were to be transported to the festival field in deluxe motor coaches very early in the  
morning to avoid the heavy traffic problems associated with this very popular event. At the  
appointed pick-up time, 6\:00.a.m., only 10 of the 20 coaches that were contracted from a local  
DMC for the single group transfer showed up at the headquarters hotel. ths\:  
The event organizer was not able to reach anyone at the DMC and did not know the indi-  
vidual transportation providers the DMC had contracted the coaches from \(no single provider  
had enough equipment\), therefore she could not contact them to find out where the remaining  
coaches were. Considering the signature nature of the event and the early morning hours, it  
was impossible to locate additional coaches. The event organizer loaded and sent the coaches  
off, instructing the drivers to return immediately to pick up the second half of the guests,  
which, due to the traffic, took more than two hours. By this time, many of the remaining 400  
guests had given up on going and those that did wait for the transfer missed the mass ascen-  
sion of the hot air balloons and most of the buffet due to the delay and the additional hour to  
return to the festival grounds.  
Needless to say the convention organizers were very disappointed with the event and the  
event organizer was compelled to refund 50 percent of the fee paid as well as cover the cost of  
refreshments for those waiting at the hotel for the second transfer, resulting in a significant  
financial loss for the event project. Even though the cause was the fault of the DMC, the event  
organizer was only able to recover the cost of the 10 coaches that did not appear from them,  
representing only 5 percent of the cost of the event.  
Parking considerations  
Hundreds or thousands of vehicles must be accommodated with parking places and  
spaces, even if for only a short period of time whilst loading or unloading occurs. As  
illustrated in Figure 11.2, the event organizer and risk manager, in conjunction with  
public safety authorities and/or specialist consultants as appropriate, should con-  
duct a parking demand analysis to determine the number and types of vehicles  
expected and the arrival and departure patterns of those vehicles to develop a park-  
ing plan that allocates, designates, and segregates parking areas according to zones  
of need and the capabilities and restraints of the parking options.  
Parking will be required and designated areas should be considered for event  
patrons, participants, performers, exhibitors, providers, staff and volunteers, the media,  
and emergency services. Lot and space assignment factors may include general pub-  
lic parking \(free or paid\), reserved / VIP parking, disabled parking, valet parking, bus  
parking, recreational vehicle parking, taxi/limousine staging, and remote park-  
and-ride, satellite, and/or overflow parking lots \(Latoski et al., 2003\). Parking area  
features such as lighting, paving, and security should be reviewed and deficiencies  
should be addressed. Parking occupancy monitoring tactics and ‘lot full’ decision  
criteria should be established and procedures for directing traffic to alternate or over-  
flow parking areas must be devised \(e.g., diversion messages via signage or media  
announcements\).  
Access routes and vehicle processing issues \(e.g., fee payment, credential/permit  
checking, traffic direction, etc.\) should be considered from a safety and efficiency per-  
spective to ensure that ingress and egress flow is properly managed and motorist frus-  
tration does not incite violation of the parking controls. Where and when possible, Site management 277

Regulations should be established \(or may exist and require compliance\) to preserve  
parking for nearby residents and businesses, maintain routes for non-event traffic flow,  
and safeguard critical event-specific access routes for emergency and essential service  
vehicles such as ambulances, law enforcement and fire vehicles, portable toilet pump-  
out and garbage removal vehicles, and utility repair and public works vehicles \(FEMA,  
2001; Latoski et al., 2003\). Ad hoc parking areas should be controlled \(or prohibited\) to  
prevent egress traffic flow conflicts.  
All parking instructions and restrictions should be publicized to event patrons  
and non-patrons as appropriate according to the level of parking demand, lot desig-  
nations, and the traffic demand caused by event parking. This may include en-route  
signage and maps included in registration and promotional materials and on web  
sites. Signage should indicate any restrictions before vehicles enter, including “No  
Responsibility’ waiver language and towing policies and pick-up locations, and  
pedestrian signage should be provided to guide patrons from the parking area to the  
event site. Maps may be drawn to scale or superimposed on aerial photographs,  
which may vary in version according to the stakeholder or user, and should include  
the following information \(Latoski et al., 2003\)\:

nation, and class of vehicle or user restrictions\).

Parking should be controlled for virtually all events. Failure to plan for and provide  
parking may increase the event's liability. Uncontrolled parking may violate city ordi-  
nances, damage public or private property, cause dangerous traffic congestion, or  
jeopardize emergency response. All parking services should be procured from experi-  
enced, licensed \(if applicable\), and properly insured providers, and all parking facili-  
ties should be evaluated for vehicular and pedestrian convenience, accessibility, safety,  
and regulatory compliance.  
Essential utilities  
The public utility services that most people take for granted in their daily lives such  
as electric power, gas, and a clean water supply are expected in the venues used for  
events as well, as are sufficient heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems  
and telecommunications capabilities. However, given the broad range of developed  
and undeveloped sites used for events and the variety of activities included in them,  
these everyday necessities must be carefully assessed for every event and at every  
event site to ensure sufficient capacities, reliable capabilities, and the proper quanti-  
ties and distribution of power, fuel, and water according to the needs of the event.  
The typical risks associated with utility services are shown in Table 11.9, and various  
jurisdictions will have regulatory codes and specifications that must be adhered to  
regarding utility usage and installations.  
Electrical power is needed for virtually every event and for most activities at an  
event. From the lights used to illuminate and decorate to the equipment used to  
make music or make coffee, there will be a demand for access to dependable elec-  
tricity in varying levels throughout the event site. Moxley \(1995\) advises that one  
must know how much power is needed, where it is needed, and where it will come  
from, and cautions that the power output must be controllable to prevent damage to SS  
Site management 279  
electronic equipment. The event organizer should determine the power needs by  
collecting electrical needs estimates from all providers requiring electricity and plot  
this out in the site plan with the venue’s engineer or power provider to ensure the  
loads \(the amount of electricity to be pulled\) are properly distributed to the locations  
where it is needed to prevent overloaded electrical circuits, which may require the  
acquisition of or augmentation with portable generators in order to mitigate the lack  
or reliability of power sources.  
The risk manager should confirm that a back-up power source is in place for  
safety and emergency lighting and sound systems should a power failure occur. All  
electrical equipment, connections, cords, cables, and wires should be checked to  
ensure they are properly secured to prevent damage, tripping hazards, or unautho-  
rized access. All temporary electrical installations should be done by professionals  
and may need to be inspected and approved by local government inspectors. The  
location and operation of controls for lighting, sound, and other electrical systems  
should be identified in order to ensure they can be turned on or off in an emergency  
situation, including those used by entertainers so that the stage lighting or sound  
system may be used or disabled as agreed upon in the emergency action plan.  
Natural gas, propane, petrol, and numerous other liquid fuels and gases are used  
at events for cooking, fueling heaters or power generators, filling helium balloons,  
and adding the fizz to carbonated drinks. The equipment using these fuels must be  
safe and in good working condition, must be installed properly according to regula-  
tory requirements, and only operated in well-ventilated areas in order to mitigate  
any noxious or obnoxious fumes they may emit. All compressed gas containers must  
be securely anchored in an upright position to prevent damage or becoming a pro-  
jectile. All fuel containers and storage areas should have restricted access achieved  
with suitable barriers, and all refueling and maintenance functions should be care-  
fully controlled. The risk manager should make certain all fuel sources have emer-  
gency shut-off valves and operators know how and when to use them.  
Potable water will be required for drinking, food preparation, cleaning, hand wash-  
ing, misters or other evaporative cooling equipment, first aid services, equipment cool-  
ing \(e.g., lasers\), and/or decorative treatments. Non-potable water may be required for  
toilet facilities, fire suppression, or dust abatement. Temporary and outdoor event sites  
are of most concern and the importation of water will need to be considered if connec-  
tion to a safe and suitable source is not sufficient or available. Temporary water sup-  
plies must be transported and stored in approved and protected containers, and should  
be tested for bacteriological safety \(HSE, 1999\). Drainage must also be considered for  
used or excess water to prevent flooding or slippery surfaces, and sullage and other  
waste or contaminated water must be disposed of properly.  
Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning \(HVAC\) systems need to be considered  
from a comfort perspective as well as a health and safety perspective. For temporary  
sites and outdoor venues, heating will be important in cold weather for the preven-  
tion of hypothermia and cooling will be critical in hot weather for the prevention of  
heat exhaustion; portable equipment is available for both. Ventilation systems must  
be carefully considered whenever any fuels or special effects are used, including the  
permissions and procedures for increasing or disabling and reconnecting the system  
for smoke or pyrotechnic effects. The event organizer and risk manager should be  
familiar with the environmental controls in any facility used to ensure access is  
available to manipulate the heating and cooling of the event space according to the  
needs of the event, and to ensure access is restricted to prevent unauthorized opera-  
tion or tampering. In addition, the configuration of ventilation system should be 280 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
assessed and monitored to ensure it is not obstructed by staging, décor, or stored  
materials or equipment.  
The telecommunications capabilities of the event site will need to be assessed based  
on the nature and demands of the event and its attendees. Given today’s climate of  
constant connectivity, attendees and exhibitors at meetings and trade shows will  
require good wireless connection to the Internet and for cellular phone service, which  
can be problematic in some locations or buildings. WiFi \(wireless fidelity\) hotspots,  
a high-frequency limited-range wireless network area for connecting to the Internet,  
are becoming plentiful in many areas, but caution should be exercised regarding the  
protection of the data transmitted over such networks. Hard wired or wireless inter-  
com systems may be needed for stage productions or language translation services,  
special equipment for the hearing or sight impaired may be required, high-speed  
telephone lines for Internet access or digital broadcasts may be needed, and public  
telephones may need to be installed at large public gatherings or remote locations.  
Telecommunications equipment and services may be available at or through the  
venue, and attention should be paid to the installation costs and usage fees charged,  
as well as the ability to quickly respond to maintenance and repair needs. And, of  
course, all installations should be completed by trained professionals and monitored  
to ensure cables, wires, and connections do not become trip hazards.  
In addition to all installation and operation issues, the event organizer and risk  
manager need to consider the maintenance and servicing of any and all utilities at the  
event site. This may include special routes and access points and times for refueling, -  
refreshing, repair, repositioning, and replacement or removal of equipment. As with  
most topics covered in this book, the organizer and risk manager are not expected to  
be experts in these areas, but they are expected to know when specialists are needed,  
who those specialists are, and how to quickly contact them. Become familiar with the  
venue’s engineering and maintenance departments and personnel, as well as the tech-  
nicians for any outside providers, and know whom to call for assistance. Also, keep in  
mind that many of the utilities to be provided for the event need to be installed and  
operational during the move-in and move-out of the rest of the staging, décor, and  
other equipment and services.  
Managing the logistics  
The event experience has been designed and defined. The event site has been meas-  
ured and mapped. The proper infrastructure has been assessed and acquired. The  
product and service providers have been contacted and contracted. The performers  
and personnel have been procured and prepared. Now, all that is left is to bring  
everything and everyone together and implement the event itself, translating ‘the  
program into the reality of an event’ \(Getz, 1997, p. 88\). This assembly of people,  
provisions, and equipment typically occurs within a short and intense period of  
time, which requires careful planning and rigorous supervision of the logistics.  
The action plan for installing and implementing the event, and, as illustrated in  
Figure 11.3, management of its logistics encompasses the analysis, sequencing, and  
supervision of the tasks, providers, and materials necessary for the on-site activities  
associated with the event project within the physical constraints of the event site  
The event risk manager must scrutinize the action plan to ensure that everything Site management 281

Figure 11.3. Overview of event logistics  
necessary is included and all aspects of the plan are well thought out and safe. This  
is best accomplished by becoming involved in its preparation.  
Coordinating flow and task sequencing  
The science of logistics is employed in military, industrial, and project management  
contexts as a way to coordinate and optimize the time-related flow and positioning  
of resources, services, supplies, and support in the necessary and proper sequence.  
The action plan for positioning and sequencing will be dependant upon the scope of  
the event, the proximity and precedence order requirements of the activities and  
event equipment, and the physical limitations of the event site. Bowdin et al. \(2006\)  
emphasize the need to manage the flow of the people and equipment into, around,  
and out of the site based on the subcontractors’ needs and time constraints. Tum,  
Norton, and Wright \(2006\) highlight the importance of calculating demand and  
matching resources to that demand. Given that time and space are finite, the event  
organizer must allocate the flow of materials and activities in such a way that the  
demand for these fixed capacity levels is chronologically and spatially managed.  
The spatial and temporal specifications for each product or service must be collected  
from each in-house or subcontracted provider, and these must be analyzed to deter-  
mine the most efficient routing, unloading and loading locations, timing, and task  
sequencing based on precedence order \(what must precede something else\) and prox-  
imity needs \(where something must be placed\). For many events, the precedence  
order for this action plan may be accomplished with simple common-sense logical  
thinking for putting first things first \(e.g., largest items in first, first in/last out, etc.\),  
but for large or complex events, use of a precedence diagraming software for the  
blending of the work breakdown structure and the production schedule may be  
required that illustrates the full scope of activities \(i.e., what needs to happen\) and the  
logical relationships among them, such as mandatory and external dependencies \(ie.,  
this can not be started until that has arrived or has been completed\) \(PMI, 2000\). Large  
or small, straightforward or complicated, the action plan’s objective is to prevent  
workers from trying to occupy the same space or use the same installation equipment a  
282 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
at the same time, or leaving work crews idle and frustrated waiting for critical tasks to  
be completed.  
Loading areas and docks  
This action plan will be strongly influenced by the physical features and limitations  
of the event site, including the capacity, location, and dimensions of loading docks  
and areas, the distance from the loading area to the event site, and the complexity,  
quality, and capabilities of the access routes. The risk manager should focus special  
attention on these areas in order to ensure proper consultation has taken place  
between the event organizer, the venue, and the providers, performers, or partici-  
pants. In addition, as some jurisdictions require unionized labor handle some or all  
unloading, loading, and movement of materials and equipment within a facility,  
compliance with these restrictions must be planned for. The risk manager also  
should confirm that all contractors and subcontractors have been properly advised  
of their role and schedule within the action plan and that someone on the event team  
is charged with monitoring contractors’ action plan conformance and performance  
during the move-in and move-out time periods.  
Many purpose-built facilities have loading docks, but there may be restrictions on  
when deliveries may be made and how long vehicles may occupy spaces. The  
entrance to the loading area or dock may have height restrictions or there may be dis-  
parate levels between the dock’s edge and the vehicle’s opening requiring special”  
ramps. Temporary or outdoor sites may require development or designation of load-  
ing areas, as well as additional parking areas for delivery vehicles throughout the  
duration of the event. Marshaling areas may be required for events expecting large  
numbers of delivery vehicles, such as expansive productions or exhibitions, in order to  
position vehicles while waiting access the dock area, or staging areas where unloaded  
equipment may be temporarily stored after unloading and before installation.  
The route from where equipment or material is unloaded to its final destination on  
the event site must be assessed. The distance between the loading area and the event  
site may be lengthy and may require intermediate equipment such as fork lifts, flat  
dollies, or hand trucks for moving heavy props or other equipment. If an outdoor  
event, the route may be dirt or grass and may require plywood be laid down to ease  
the movement of wheeled cases or hand trucks. The route may involve doorways  
and/or passageways with sharp turns that can not accommodate the size of equip-  
ment, which will require alternate routes or disassembly of the item prior to move-in.  
The event location may be on a different floor than the loading area and although  
freight elevators may be available at purpose-built facilities, these elevators may not  
have the dimensional or weight load capacity for the equipment being delivered.  
Moxley \(1995\) advises that one must know all the options for getting from the loading  
area to the event site at a venue, no matter how extreme the final solution may be. This  
may include using construction cranes to hoist equipment to a rooftop, using the esca-  
lator in the public lobby to move a large piece of staging or décor, or walking live ani-  
mals up the levels of a contiguous parking garage.  
Move-in through move-out  
The risk manager should confirm that the logistics of the action plan includes and  
chronologically choreographs the entire duration of the use of the event site, from  
the delivery of the first item to the removal of the last item and the cleaning and aS a TS SSS ns sissies sss  
Site management 283  
restoration of the site to its original \(or better\) condition. This often starts with the  
pre-con meeting at which all key role players review the chronological details in the  
context of a common picture of what each must accomplish, and ends with the post-  
con at which the results are reviewed and residual problems are resolved \(Connell,  
2002\).  
The two periods that are often insufficiently addressed in terms of logistics are the  
times during the event when maintenance and replenishment activities must take  
place and during the dismantling and move-out period. For multi-day or multi-  
venue events, the delivery of supplies will often be required \(e.g., replenishing  
inventories for exhibitors or food provisions for concessionaires\) and maintenance  
activities will need to be conducted \(e.g., portable toilet pump-out or equipment  
replacement or repositioning\). Not only will storage areas need to be established  
\(and often protected with security\); the timing and routing will need to be integrated  
into the action plan and the site plan. Although these activities may often be sched-  
uled prior to each day’s opening, this may not be sufficient or feasible and arrange-  
ments for intra-event movement of deliveries must be made.  
The closure phase, during which the event is dismantled and the equipment is  
moved out and reloaded onto all the respective provider’s vehicles, is often the most  
haphazard and risky. The excitement is over, the workers are often tired, and the event  
personnel just want to go home and relax. Consequently, disassembly and repacking  
is chaotic, equipment is lost or damaged, congestion develops at the loading areas,  
frustration and tempers flare, and worker injuries occur. The risk manager should  
ensure that the move-out is as carefully choreographed, staffed, and monitored as the  
move-in, and that cleaning services are procured and properly conducted.  
# Summary  
The event site and the space available within that site can become an asset or a liability,  
and it is critical to remember that everything at an event requires sufficient space to  
minimize risk, particularly from a safety and emergency egress point of view. Site selec-  
tion and inspection should be done using sensible procurement and assessment crite-  
ria, and once the site has been acquired, complete familiarity with it must be achieved.  
An event site could be considered a virtual, temporary, and self-contained metrop-  
olis. Confirming or importing the necessary infrastructure for a fully functional event  
site requires a thorough assessment of the various needs, constraints, and options  
associated with bringing an event to life. This assessment must be conducted with  
many points of view considered, including those attending, those supplying goods  
and services, those operating attractions and equipment, and those participating in the  
event, as well as those who may be affected by the event occurring in their vicinity.  
The risk manager should review the scope of the travel and transportation perti-  
nent to the event based on its type, scope, purpose, audience, and location to deter-  
mine the necessary operational safeguards and infrastructure. A written parking  
plan should be included in the event’s evidentiary documentation and the audience  
should be advised of parking options and restrictions in the event promotions and  
publicity. Essential utilities such as power, fuel, water, and telecommunications  
must assessed for accessibility, reliability, quantity, and quality, and any deficiencies  
must be mitigated with ancillary services as appropriate. on ———————  
284 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
Bringing the event to life on site and then closing it down involves the coordination  
of dozens to hundreds to thousands of tasks, personnel, and materials, all of which  
must be scheduled and positioned in a logical manner. Failure to properly sequence all  
this activity and equipment movement can result in a logistical collapse that could  
threaten the safety of the event personnel and audience, as well as turn its operations  
into an expensive and torturous nightmare. The application of good procurement  
practices, common sense, attention to detail, and, if necessary, project management  
software will increase the probability of successful site management.  
Key safeguards  
¢ Include weather, economic and political conditions, and the site’s vicinity, support  
services, and safety in site selection decisions.  
¢ Spatial decisions must consider dimensions, proximity, and flow capacity.  
e Assess and control the transportation impact of and vehicular access to and within  
the event site.  
¢ Designated ingress routes and entrance gates should be linked with parking area  
designations.  
e Access to utility areas and equipment should be restricted to prevent mishaps,  
injuries, and accidental or intentional interference.  
¢ Contingency plans should be in place for the loss or interruption of any critical utility.  
¢ Know whom to call for immediate on-site plumbing or electrical maintenance and  
repair.  
¢ Incorporate reserve time into the operations action plan for unforeseen logistical  
problems.

An Intergalactic Reception  
As a tactic to generate publicity and press coverage that would distinguish Albu-  
querque and New Mexico from the surrounding Southwestern states and communi-  
ties, a one-night festival-style event was created for the convention and visitors bureau  
to capitalize on the science fiction/science fact assets of the destination. Not only is  
New Mexico home to the legendary Roswell Incident; Albuquerque is home to  
Lovelace Medical Center where the first astronauts were tested as humorously  
depicted in the film The Right Stuff. In addition, New Mexico has the Alamogordo  
Space Center and the Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, and boasts the  
highest per-capita ratio of science fiction authors in the U.S. The event was an all-  
volunteer effort with all the goods, services, and exhibits donated in support of the  
bureau, including sponsorship by a local television station.  
The Albuquerque Intergalactic Reception featured a UFO landing strip; a dozen  
exhibits including the UFO Museum from Roswell, roving lunar robots from Sandia  
National Lab’s Robotics Department, hands-on zero-gravity activities, and a full-  
scale model of the Mercury I Space Capsule; a science fiction book fair with book  
signings by several New Mexico writers; a portable inflatable planetarium; tele-  
scopes provided by the university’s astronomy club; food concessions and a beer  
garden; a disk jockey on a stage playing science fiction movie themes; an inflatable  
Moon Walk bouncy cage for children; a ‘Milky Way Mercado’ of souvenir vendors;  
and a special appearance by the star of a popular science fiction television program  
who signed autographs at the television station’s sponsor tent.  
The site was the uppermost level of the five-level parking structure adjacent to the  
convention center because it was the largest and highest open space in the down-  
town area, and the parking authority wanted to promote the parking structure so  
more residents would use this facility. The first three levels of the parking structure  
were available as free parking for event-goers and the fourth level was reserved for  
parking the event vehicles. All the staging, tenting, equipment, and exhibiting com-  
panies were notified in writing that the access to the event site was through the park-  
ing structure levels, which had a seven-foot clearance.  
Set-up day arrived and so did the truck delivering the portable toilets, which was  
too tall for the seven-foot clearance and the toilets had to be stationed on the ground  
floor of the parking structure next to the elevator because ‘tipping’ them was not an  
option, and directional signage had to made to inform attendees of their new loca-  
tion. Despite the event organizer’s clear communication to all the parties involved  
regarding clearance limits and access to the event, the portable toilets were just the  
tip of the iceberg. The convention center’s food concessionaire had to revise its cater-  
ing operations that day because it realized its colorful concession wagons could not  
fit within elevator, nor could they withstand rolling them throughout the five levels  
of the parking structure route. The model of the space capsule had to be stationed on  
the street next to the parking structure because it could not fit under the seven-foot  
clearance. The emergency medical technicians \(EMTs\) contracted to oversee the  
event had to walk up the five levels with their emergency gear because their ambu-  
lance was too tall for the seven-foot clearance. The first beer truck could not make it  
in because it was too big for the seven-foot clearance.  
Nevertheless, the event was a success, attracting more than 2000 men, women,  
assorted aliens, and especially children, and generating more than \$300000 worth of  
national and international publicity coverage. And everyone on the event team,  
from participants to providers, soon made the low clearance into the running joke. mn

# Introduction  
The alpha and omega of every meeting or event is the person attending the event, and  
everything so far discussed in this book leads to and must focus on that person — the  
audience member, contributor, delegate, dignitary, exhibitor, guest, media, performer,  
or speaker — and the assembly of these people in a particular place at a particular time.  
Everything created and coordinated to bring these people together has been selected  
and arranged to meet their needs and manage their expectations according to the goals  
and objectives of the event and the facilities and resources available. The program has  
been designed and the site has been laid out in such a way to ensure the desired expe-  
rience is delivered in a safe and effective manner. The final step is anticipating and  
accommodating all the physical factors associated with this assembly based upon the  
numbers, behavior norms, and attributes of the event being held, as illustrated in  
Figure 12.1, and the characteristics of the attendees \(as shown in Table 9.2 \).  
The risk manager should focus on the plans for the arrival of these people, their  
likely movement flow and congregation within the event, and the tactics for con-  
trolling and sculpting their projected and preferred behavior patterns. And make no  
mistake; behavior can be sculpted with proper planning. From admission systems to  
queue configuration and seating plans to site cleanliness, cues on the rules of behav-  
ior can be communicated in creative and compelling ways. The typical assembly  
risks are shown in Table 12.1, which should be carefully examined in the context of  
blending movement, behavior, and customer service. Attendee management 289

Attendee management \(encompassing all those in attendance\) seeks to direct and  
control the attendee’s actions and interactions with the event from arrival through 290 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

departure. Effectiveness relies upon supplying the attendee with sufficient informa-  
tion, means, and methods to access the event, participate in the event, and exit the  
event in a safe and successful manner. As shown in Figure 12.2, the attendee’s inter-  
action with the event experience encompasses numerous spatial and temporal  
dimensions that must be accommodated with procedural and operational strategies. ©  
Sufficient space must be allocated, entry procedures and portals must be evident  
and understandable, and enough information must be provided to ensure navigating  
the event experience is achievable and frustration is minimized. The event organizer  
and risk manager should examine and envision the attendee’s routes and interactions  
from the point of arrival through the point of departure in order to devise tactics that  
will ensure the desired actions are feasible and facilitated at each point of service  
within the process. There are countless ways to configure and control these points of  
service and interactions, which vary according to the style and scope of the event and  
event audience, and offer numerous creative opportunities and strategies for crafting  
a safer and more satisfying event experience for the attendee.  
Admission control and credential systems  
Unless the meeting or event is free, open to the public, and in a venue that has no  
perimeter barriers or occupancy limits there will be some form of admission system.  
Admission systems include numerous entry controls, from signing a register to  
collecting tickets to checking badges or other credentials. The nature of the event, its  
activities, and its audience may indicate the need for a layered system that includes  
a variety of high- and low-tech entry controls and credentials \(Garber, 2004\).  
Credentials establish an individual’s access rights to an event or certain areas or  
activities at an event. Many public and civic events sell tickets that permit entry and  
the savvy ones also sell passes that permit special access to desirable locations,  
attractions, or services. Concerts and other entertainment events often use different  
colored tickets for different seating sections. Festivals will often use colored wrist-  
bands for each event day or to indicate whether the wearer may purchase alcohol or  
have access to special exhibits or events. Some events require the issuance of cre-  
dentials with photo ID, such as laminated passes on lanyards for political events or  
for the media at a sports event. Meetings and conferences typically use a registration ennai  
Attendee management 291  
\_ System \(sometimes called attendee management systems\) to pre-qualify or register  
individuals who will attend, and the attendee’s or delegate’s credential, their badge,  
may serve as a name tag as well as a lead retrieval system for the accompanying  
trade show. Social or life-cycle functions often have a guest book to sign or perhaps  
an invitation to show at the entrance.  
Clarity regarding entry and credential acquisition procedures is critical for the  
attendee and clarity regarding admission authorization is critical for the security  
personnel charged with checking credentials prior to admission. The prospective  
attendee must be advised of exactly how and where to acquire the admission cre-  
dential as well as the procedures for using that credential, including what will occur  
during the admittance process \(e.g., going through a security checkpoint such as a  
turnstile or magnetometer\). This will include instructions regarding entrance routes  
and times, segregated or restricted entrances, seating designations, prohibited items  
or activities, and any other information needed in order to gain admittance in an effi-  
cient manner. Security or stewarding personnel and ushers must be thoroughly  
briefed on the various types of credentials to be used and their specific meanings  
\(e.g., seating assignment, access privileges, permissions or prohibitions, etc.\) to  
ensure the efficacy of the admittance control system.  
Name badges all look alike to the security or stewarding staff person that has  
not been shown what is acceptable or applicable, which suggests that it is advisable  
that the various credentials provided should be distinctively differentiated in  
some manner such as color coding and/or title \(e.g., green for full access, red for  
- exhibitor, blue for Tuesday only, etc.\). Ticket differentiation may include ticketing to  
different entrances, time of arrival, or reserved seating. Of note\: festival seating and  
general admission seating — either no seats are provided or seating is first come/  
\_ first serve — has been shown to cause serious crowd rushes and crushes at high  
occupancy entertainment events and has been prohibited for such events in many  
\_ jurisdictions.  
The need for credentials expands for larger or more complex events and the need  
for controlling access \(see Table 12.2\). Access to various areas of an event and event  
site should be based on “zones of need.’ Limited access to various event activities,  
individuals, equipment, or materials should be based on specific conditions, such as  
a specific work assignment on a specific day or at a specific time or the purchase of  
\_the right to such access. The risk manager must determine what must be protected  
and from whom, then employ the appropriate access controls and security precau-  
tions to prevent unauthorized access to restricted areas, times, people, or items.  
Strategies to prevent exceeding occupancy limits must also be reviewed, particularly  
for high demand activities or attractions such as popular sessions at a conference or  
special tents at a fair.  
There is a difference between public and private areas at an event. These are often  
designated as front of the house \(FOH\) and back of the house \(BOH\) in a public  
assembly facility Jewell, 1978\), as illustrated in Figure 12.3. In some cases, areas or  
items that must be protected are in the FOH areas, in which case, additional atten-  
tion must be paid to the security of those areas or items. Controlling access is not  
only a means of protecting event assets and individuals from nefarious activity,  
although that is an important factor. It is also a matter of safety because BOH or  
restricted access areas often contain equipment and technicians performing tasks  
that could cause injury to the unauthorized individual or that individual could cre-  
ate or instigate hazardous conditions for those working on and others attending the  
event. ST

The risk manager should review the admission control and credential systems  
devised for any gaps or vulnerabilities, including confirmation that they have been  
thoroughly integrated into the site, marketing, and operational plans. As noted in  
Chapters 3 and 8, information gathered during the registration or admittance cre-  
dentialing process must be protected from misuse according to privacy compliance  
requirements, and, for international events, precautions and protocols ne be  
required to ensure the prospective attendee is genuine. As noted in Chapter 9 all  
cash value credentials \(i.e., tickets, purchased Passes, etc.\) must be eee from  
loss, theft, or counterfeit. All controlled area access credentials must also b  
tected from being compromised or counterfeited. a Attendee management 293  
Consider this... 12.1  
Foreign visas  
Attendees at international meetings and events must often acquire a visa in order to enter the  
country in which the event is being held. The visa, granted by the country’s government, pro-  
vides verification that the specific non-citizen is eligible to enter the country for a specific pur-  
pose and for a specific time period. The necessity and procedure for obtaining a visa varies  
from country to country, each with their own requirements and restrictions, and can include  
intense scrutiny of the applicant. The U.S., for example, may require the collection of digital  
fingerprints and a face-to-face interview at its embassy or consulate in order to issue a visa  
\(they will be screening applicants according to a set of keywords on the Technology Alert List  
or specific nationalities or backgrounds on a Watch List\).  
International attendees to a U.S. meeting, for example, are sometimes asked to provide a  
‘Letter of Invitation’ from the sponsoring organization, which some events will post as a  
downloadable document on their Web site for the convenience of their attendees. However,  
this practice may be problematic as some individuals use the pretext of conference attendance  
as a way to enter a country for other purposes. Many meeting planners now require the pay-  
ment of the registration fee prior to issuing the invitation letter.  
Some countries may require a special type of visa for anyone receiving speaking fees or hon-  
oraria for lectures and presentations. Some countries have visa waiver programs that only  
require passports \(or machine readable passports with digital photo or biometrics chip  
requirements\) for nationals from specific countries. It is strongly advised that event organiz-  
ers consult with their government \(e.g., the U.S. State Department\) regarding visa rules and  
requirements and educate their attendees about immigration procedures. It may be possible to  
list the event with the government and provide a roster \(and updates\) of conference partici-  
pants that can be posted on an intranet for the country’s embassies and consulates to facilitate  
the visa approval and processing procedure.  
Arrival and departure modes  
\_ The audience or attendees or guests will arrive at a certain point in time through cer-  
tain portals and will depart at a certain point in time through certain portals. They  
will also move through the event space in a variety of ways, planned and perhaps  
unplanned. In order to manage this human movement or ‘pedestrian traffic flow,’  
the risk manager must understand and anticipate this traffic flow, including arrival  
and departure modes, queuing, and human behavior patterns in both normal con-  
ditions as well as emergency conditions, as illustrated in Figure 12.4. Arrival and  
departure modes may be defined as trickle or dump.  
© Trickle mode\: The attendees or guests arrive and/or depart at various times through-  
out the duration of the event.  
e Dump mode\: Most of the attendees or guests arrive and/or depart all at the same time.  
Obviously, the type, scope, and schedule of the event and the size and characteristics  
of the audience will shape the plans to accommodate these individuals. A consumer  
gate show \(exposition\) expecting 10000 people will likely have a surge of arrivals at its  
opening but will have attendees trickling in and out throughout its hours of operation. 294 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

A concert expecting 10000, on the other hand, will be very different, with everyone  
arriving within a short period of time and departing en masse. The risk manager  
should carefully examine the arrival and departure issues shown in Table 12.3 in order  
to evaluate the physical and procedural strategies for accommodating the number of  
event attendees.  
The size and layout of the entrance to an event, as well as the arrangement of attrac-  
tions near the entrance \(preferably limited\), will facilitate the proper traffic flow into  
the event. The number and location of entrances must be reviewed to ensure they are  
appropriate for the type and scope of event, as well as the arrival mode. Depending  
on the event's size and scope, barricades, fencing, or rope and stanchion ‘bank maze’  
queues may be needed to help control the flow of pedestrian traffic and direct people  
entering or departing the event site or to activities within the event site.  
Entrances should ‘look’ like an entrance; decorations and/or signage should be  
used, including clearly labeled segregated entrances as well as clearly marked no-entry  
and exit-only portals \(Au, Ryan, Carey, and Whalley, 1993\). Entrances must be CC CC CES ETS eta mecmamenennecmnntte  
Attendee management 295  
allocated enough space and configured in a manner that accommodates and facilitates  
the designated service processing system \(e.g., registration, ticket sales and collection,  
credential checking, etc.\), processing rates, and the volume of people expected. A sep-  
arate desk, table, or counter should be set up to handle guests with service difficulties  
or deviations so the majority of the guests can proceed without waiting for the prob-  
lem to be resolved \(Goldblatt, 2002; Silvers, 2004a\). In addition, the risk manager  
should confirm that entrances and entry procedures are equipped to accommodate  
patrons with special needs such as sight, hearing, and mobility impairments.  
Accommodating the arrival and intra\~event movement of special guests \(e.g., dig-  
nitaries or celebrities\), performers, and participants may require special attention  
and facilities. Exclusive entry \(and exit\) routes and entrances may need to be estab-  
lished and protected with barriers and/or personnel, and may need to be kept secret  
and hidden from view altogether. The intra-event movement of these people may  
need to be regulated and/or escorted to ensure such movement does not cause  
crowd crushes or hazardous crowd flow obstructions. For example, one country  
western singer is rolled into his stadium concerts inside a specially equipped pack-  
ing case that looks like the other equipment cases to prevent crowd crushes by fans  
as he gets from the performer entrance to the stage area.  
The manner and means of exiting an event \(egress\) must accommodate the audi-  
ence as efficiently as the arrival. If there is an emergency evacuation, all available  
means of egress must be clearly identified and used by the audience. The number,  
location, and character of emergency exits will be determined by the local fire codes,  
but these must be reviewed by the risk manager to ensure the proper safety and  
emergency precautions are incorporated into the event plans, such as making an  
opening announcement regarding the use of the closest available exit in case of an  
emergency, and that sufficient human resources are allocated and positioned to facil-  
itate this mass egress.  
The time of day, crowd emotions, and the policies permitting or prohibiting  
re-admittance to the event must be examined to determine departure risks. The  
inclusion of exterior lighting equipment may be required to illuminate exit routes  
and parking areas if the event ends after dark. Extra security personnel may be neces-  
sary to patrol these areas or to control exuberant or antagonistic audience members.  
Mass exodus may also put undue pressure on transportation facilities and routes,  
which must be carefully evaluated based on the departure characteristics.  
Crowd management and control  
A crowd is a large number of individual persons gathered together at a certain time,  
within a certain space, and for certain and often similar reasons. Managing a crowd  
requires developing the hard and soft systems that will regulate and shape the  
movement and behavior of the individuals within the crowd in such a way that  
safety and order are maintained. Crowd management and crowd control are syner-  
gistic rather than synonymous \(Fruin, 1984, 1993\), as illustrated in Figure 12.5, and  
typical strategies are shown in Table 12.4. .  
The systematic planning for the orderly movement and assembly of people begins  
with a needs assessment to determine what portals, facilities, and space allotments  
are necessary to accommodate the size and type of gathering anticipated. This is fol-  
lowed by an analysis of the anticipated behaviors that must be controlled through en

policies, procedures, personnel, and equipment. Tactics are then developed, imple-  
mented, and monitored throughout the duration of the event, and evaluated after the  
event in order to capture lessons learned. If using a purpose built facility that has  
accommodated a similar event, the facility should have guidance regarding crowd  
management tactics that have proven to be effective. If, however, the event size, type,  
or site is unusual or initial, guidance should be sought from comparable events and/or  
locations, and, if appropriate, from security or crowd management specialists.  
Crowd size and density is a significant factor in crowd management. Most of the  
deadliest event disasters involved large crowds, with most of the injuries and fatali-  
ties due to crowd compression and the subsequent loss of footing or inability to  
move \(Fruin, 1993\). Abbott and Abbott \(2000\) note that the dangers of overcrowding  
are panic, violence, injury, and liability \(i.e., foreseeability and duty of care\). Fruin  
\(1984\) contends that understanding the crowd flow principles of time, space, infor-  
mation, and energy \(force\) is central to the prevention of critical crowd densities and  
triggering rapid crowd movements that could precipitate unsafe conditions. ee

e Energy\: critical crowd density force; intensity of psychological and physiological  
stresses; immobility or compressive power due to pressing forward, pushing,  
leaning, or collapses; pressure exerted within the mass and/or against a barrier.  
Crowd behavior will be shaped by the unity, intensity, and volatility of the crowd  
and their objectives \(Emergency Management Australia, 1999\), as well as the audi-  
ence preparation activities, control procedures, and monitoring actions conducted  
by the event organizers. Crowd control measures should be devised that include a  
progression of triggers or thresholds for implementation ranging from orderly  
assembly to crisis situations involving unlawful or unsafe behavior \(Abbott and  
Abbott, 2000\), beginning with the limiting of the number of tickets sold to prevent  
\_ overcrowding in the first place.  
Consider this... 12.2  
Deadly rumor  
August 31, 2005\: It was reported that 841 people died and more than 350 were injured when the  
rumor of a suicide bomber within the midst of a Shiite religious procession of hundreds of thou-  
sands of worshippers caused a panicked stampede on the two-lane Al-Aaimmah Bridge over  
the Tigris River in Baghdad, Iraq. Some were injured or suffocated in the crush; some jumped  
into the river and were injured or drowned; others fell into the river and drowned when a rail-  
ing on the bridge collapsed. Most of the dead were believed to be women and children. The  
rumor that incited the stampede was not an intentional terrorist act, but its effect was in part  
caused by tension resulting from a terrorist bombing earlier that day near the Shiite shrine where  
the worshippers were headed and from repeated sectarian attacks by extremists against large  
religious gatherings. In addition to this climate of fear and 110-degree heat, the crush was exac-  
erbated by the extreme density of the crowd and the blockage of pilgrims jammed against the  
checkpoint at the bridge’s western edge.  
Crowd movement  
The traffic flow during and within the event must be carefully considered. Pedestrian  
traffic flows should do just that, flow. Anything that impedes that flow can be haz-  
ardous. The larger and denser the crowd, the more dangerous these movements  
become. As discussed in Chapter 10, wayfinding and one’s orientation within an  
event site not only facilitates the delivery of the event experience as designed and  
desired; it is critically important to the flow of people and the control of hazardous 298 Risk Management for Meetings and Events

conditions. People need to be able to see where they are and where they are going.  
People also need sufficient space to be able to move about.  
The occupancy capacity will be determined by the local fire codes, but the event lay-  
out and program of activities may cause dangerous mass movements at certain times  
in pursuit of certain activities. The thoughtful positioning and timing of event activities  
and attractions can reduce congestion in certain areas and build traffic in others. The  
use of event personnel to add the ‘human’ connection may facilitate more controlled  
movements through the event space, particularly during an emergency when people  
must either evacuate an area or make space for responders to reach a specific area.  
Hazardous crowd movements may occur due to flight response or craze competi-  
tion motivations \(Fruin, 1993\) causing crowd collapses, crazes, crushes, panics, or  
surges, and may also include such things as mixing vehicles and pedestrians, moving  
animals or attractions through crowds, and cross flows within dense crowds \(Au et al.,  
1993; Emergency Management Australia, 1999; FEMA, 2001; HSE, 1993; Silvers, 2004a\).  
Au et al. \(1993, pp. 5-10\) identify hazards to be included in a risk assessment as over-  
crowding, crushing, impact/collision, pile-up, trampling, surging, pushing, swaying,  
rushing, falling, and tripping; and the possible consequences include anxiety, physical  
discomfort, minor or major injury, and death. High density movements may be  
expected at mass arrival and departure times, but should be carefully monitored to  
ensure pressure is not building to a point at which movement is constricted too much.  
Still \(2005\) notes that one must also understand that at high densities the movement  
flow rates are affected and regulated by the slowest members of the crowd \(the ‘little  
old lady factor’\). Typical strategies for managing crowd movement are shown in  
Table 12.5.  
The risk manager should also pay particular attention to queue management  
because these waiting lines can instigate or amplify dangerous crowd conditions.  
The crowd density, pressure, size, and duration of a queue will have an impact on  
the person waiting, and may become a source of anything from grumbling to haz-  
ardous crowd movements. The beginning of a queue should be readily apparent and  
queues should not obstruct traffic or other event elements. Shape the queue with Oa  
Attendee management 299  
appropriate barrier equipment \(e.g., rope and stanchions, temporary fencing, etc.\) or  
marshalling personnel. Although once an orderly queue has been established it typ-  
ically becomes self-perpetuating \(Au et al., 1993\), personnel may be required to  
direct people to the shortest queue. Avoid queues on, exiting on, or blocking stairs or  
escalators, and ticket or registration queues should be positioned a sufficient dis-  
tance from entrances and in such a way that they are separated from traffic or other  
hazards \(Au et al., 1993\). Metering tactics such as inviting bar mitzvah or wedding  
dinner guests to partake of the buffet by table number, using color-coded and/or  
numbered boarding vouchers for group transfers, and time-of-arrival ticketing for  
entertainment attractions can assist in managing the size of queues.  
Crowd behavior  
Crowd behavior is potentially very different than individual behavior because at a  
certain critical mass and under certain conditions or catalysts the individual loses  
the ability to control their movement or suspends social responsibility and the  
crowd can become a cohesive and collective entity in pursuit of a common goal,  
which may be benign or malevolent and can become dangerous if it exceeds the spa-  
tial and/or safety capacity of the environment. This is typically influenced by the  
nature of the event, the agenda or activities, the size and density of the multitude,  
and urgency or emergency conditions \(real or imagined\). Dangerous crowd behav-  
ior can spread like a wildfire or rush like a raging river. There are, however, tactics  
- that can control these negative conditions, including the removal of fuel for the fire  
or providing an alternate spill-off route for the river’s flow.  
Crowds and their behavior have been studied by psychologists, sociologists, and  
engineers in economic, social, political, and physical contexts ranging from civil dis-  
order to special events and from railroad stations to shopping malls. Beginning with  
the collective behavior work of French crowd psychologist Gustave Le Bon in the  
1890s all the way to the present day with fire safety engineers and crowd safety  
experts conducting crowd simulations that focus on public assembly facilities and  
transportation networks, the nature and movement of crowds reveals that their  
behavior is based upon the environmental conditions, the individual crowd mem-  
ber’s motives and emotions, and the forces facilitating or obstructing the individ-  
\_ual’s attempts to attain desired outcomes.  
In contrast to Le Bon, who proposed that a crowd’s behavior was irrational, herd  
like, and hypnotically homogenous, Berk \(1974\) posits that collective behavior rang-  
ing from collective expression to collective disorder is grounded in rational and con-  
scious thought, often instigated due to legitimate motives, and, when closely examined,  
does not represent a homogenous or single mind set. Rather, it is composed of indi-  
viduals participating in group problem solving wherein a lack of time or informa-  
tion and heightened emotion may undermine decision accuracy but not rationality.  
However, Gladwell reminds us that ‘once we’re part of a group, we're all suscepti-  
ble to peer pressure and social norms’ \(2002, p. 171\). It must also be remembered  
that, after all, an event is a ‘collective experience’ that often relies upon and encour-  
ages shared actions and emotions. In other words, the individuals in a crowd have  
not lost their mind; they have made their own decisions, which results in common-  
ality rather than absolute unity, and the collective behavior may be cooperative or  
competitive \(e.g., for scare resources\).  
Gladwell \(2002\), citing the work of criminologists, also suggests that criminal or  
undesirable behavior is, in part, a result of physical conditions that reflect \(and project\) hacia a aaa  
300 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
the social context — if broken windows or graffiti remain unattended to, the message is  
that no one cares or is in control. Veno and Veno \(1992\) contend that behavior is affected  
by example; successive minor incidents empower individuals to defy regulations or  
social norms because authority has been de-legitimized and a new ‘norm’ has been  
established. It is the little problems — indications that things are not under control — that  
gives permission to act in ways that are not acceptable. This includes addressing unde-  
sirable behavior that may occur, which, without timely and visible intervention, may  
lead others to exhibit the same infractions \(e.g., throwing objects onto a sports field or  
climbing a perimeter fence to gain access to an event\) in the belief they will not be  
penalized. The lack of response allows escalation of a situation, as shown at the Puerto  
Rico Day parade in New York City in 2000 at which more than 50 women suffered var-  
ious and increasing degrees of molestation whilst the police stood by without taking  
action \(Tarlow, 2002\).  
Frustration and boredom are often cited as instigators of undesirable behavior \(see  
for example, Au et al., 1993, Doukas, 2006, and Veno and Veno, 1992\). Frustration—  
ageression theories, stating that frustration \(particularly unexpected frustration\)  
increases the likelihood of aggression, hypothesize that destructive behavior often  
results when an individual is prevented from achieving a desired goal. \(Boredom  
may be seen as a type of frustration.\) The level of aggression is based upon the indi-  
vidual’s tolerance level when severe restrictions or controls are imposed \(Veno and  
Veno, 1992\). The aggressive behavior may be in response to such strictures or emo-  
tional triggers such as elation, fear, or anger, and may be exaggerated by impairments —  
such as drug or alcohol intoxication and lack of accurate information. Aggressive  
behavior may also result from physical discomfort due to environmental conditions  
such as heat, cold, noise, etc., and may become more likely if others are displaying  
aggressive behavior and are either rewarded or go unpunished. The risk manager  
should seek ways to minimize frustration and closely monitor and quickly respond  
to crowd conditions that indicate frustration \(Au et al., 1993\).  
Crowd control  
In order to control a crowd, one must first understand the factors that shape and  
influence the crowd, establish policies and procedures that limit undesirable behav-  
ior or conditions, continually monitor the status of crowd conditions, and implement  
response plans should conditions cross a pre-established threshold. For example, if a  
queue exceeds a certain limit another ticket window will be opened, or if certain spec-  
tators or audience members are exhibiting undesirable behavior they will be ejected  
from the event. Typical crowd types and response strategies are shown in Table 12.6,  
most of which center on observation, supervision, and communication, and should  
be based on the hierarchy of tactical steps as discussed in Chapter 5 and shown in  
Figure 12.6.  
In the event that crowd conditions become unmanageable, event organizers will  
likely turn to law enforcement personnel to control a situation \(Beene, 1992\). Their  
approach will begin with a situation assessment followed by a hierarchy of actions as  
shown in Figure 12.7. Understanding their approach may influence the risk manager’s  
response plan development, as well as facilitate the effectiveness of law enforcement  
in the event that they are called in. Once law enforcement has been called in, however  
the event must typically surrender all authority to the police. If the event itself is edn  
troversial \(e.g., a protest march\), expects eruptions \(e.g., highly-contested sports events\), SS.

Figure 12.8 Typical hierarchy of responsibility and authority for crowd control personnel  
Crowd control personnel are a key component of any crowd control strategy and  
they must be properly equipped, trained, and deployed. Crowd control personnel  
may range from ushers and stewards to professional security forces and law enforce-  
ment personnel. It is important to establish clear guidelines regarding the hierarchy of  
command and control as well as the duties and authority that each level of personnel  
will have, such as shown in Figure 12.8. It is widely recommended that ushers and  
stewards not be assigned with adversarial or physical intervention duties, only report-  
ing situations that require such tactics to security personnel or law enforcement.  
As with all event personnel, providing assistance and guidance to the event patron  
should be a primary responsibility of crowd control personnel. Doukas \(2006\) notes  
employing preventative tactics and assisting crowds is often far more effective than  
trying to control them. The actions and attitudes of staff and security personnel can  
lead to compliance or defiance with respect to instructions and regulations. Provision  
of accurate and timely information can often prevent high-risk actions or de-escalate  
crowd tension or anxiety as well as communicate the ‘house rules’ and behavioral  
norms expected of the event audience, and may cause patrons to take an active role in  
the crowd control process, empowering them to monitor and report situations, condi-  
tions, or behaviors that threaten their safety \(Wertheimer, 1980\).  
Crowd control personnel must be provided with training regarding the crowd  
management and control mechanisms in place \(e.g., admittance systems, rules for  
behavior, restricted access areas, etc.\), the crowd monitoring activities to be carried  
out, and the procedures to be used regarding response to incidents and conditions,  
as well as specific training and procedures for diffusing and/or physical intervention  
of aggressive, abusive, or violent behavior. They should also be provided with high  
visibility clothing that identifies them as authorized to conduct these activities i  
304 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
\(WorkSafe Victoria, 2006\). Keep in mind that crowd control personnel must be protected  
in compliance with occupational health and safety regulations, and may need to be pro-  
vided with protective equipment \(e.g., hearing protection\), as discussed in Chapter 4.  
Monitoring activities will require appropriate surveillance equipment and vantage  
points. Stewards and ushers will likely be strategically placed in amongst the crowd  
and can observe conditions and individual behavior problems, but observing crowd  
density problems will usually require an elevated vantage point. As discussed in  
Chapters 5 and 8, a communication network and procedures must be established to  
ensure that emerging crowd problems are properly transmitted within the appropri-  
ate chain of command. It must also be remembered that the very nature of a crowd  
\(i.e., its size and composition\) can make such things as communication and changes  
in action slower and more difficult \(Emergency Management Australia, 1999\).  
Crowd control is not an imperative exclusive to large-scale events with immense  
audiences. One need only recall the tragedy involving the band Great White’s per-  
formance at the Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island that had an atten-  
dance of approximately 300, of which one-third perished, to recognize that the need  
for crowd control is dictated by time, space, and volatility or urgency; not just an  
enormous number of people.  
Attendee care and comfort  
Crowd management and control is greatly enhanced when its focus remains on the  
customer — the attendee. Effective interactions between the attendee and the event  
organization are reliant upon physical \(tangible\) as well as behavioral \(intangible\)  
strategies that ensure an appropriate level of assistance and courtesy is delivered,  
which, in turn, increases the effectiveness of crowd control strategies. Au et al. \(1993\)  
and others advise that the attendee must not be relied upon to recognize potential haz-  
ards associated with their actions; they don’t realize the impact their actions could  
have on others or their immediate environment. Therefore initial interventions should  
be polite and instructive rather than abrasive. This customer service attitude can  
reduce instances of inappropriate behavior or incidents causing or escalating haz-  
ardous conditions. Anticipating the attendee’s physical and emotional needs within  
the context of the event and event venue is necessary for development of the tangible  
and intangible features that underscore this preventative approach.  
Care and welfare  
The event organizer will be able to reduce frustration, confusion, and anxiety —  
common causes of crowd control problems and customer dissatisfaction — by providing  
space, services, and amenities that demonstrate attention to the care and welfare of the  
event patron, such as those shown in Table 12.7. These are in addition to the facilities  
and services required to ensure health and safety such as toilets and first aid stations.  
The risk manager should confirm that the positioning and signposting of these public  
amenities is acceptable and adequate, ensuring that they are accessible without  
obstructing crowd movement.  
Meeting and waiting areas, places where patrons can congregate while waiting for  
others in their group, should be allocated sufficient space and be positioned far  
enough away from entrances or exits to make certain they do not interfere with the eee

ingress and egress flow. Information booths should be centrally located and highly  
visible, and must be staffed with personnel who are completely familiar with the event  
venue and the event's policies and procedures. Lost and found centers, including  
those for lost children, should have protocols established for receiving and returning  
property or children as well as communications capability to make announcements or  
advisories as appropriate. Sub-contracted services must be acquired according to  
proper procurement policies, and appropriate liability insurance coverage for both  
in-house and outsourced services must be confirmed.  
Accommodations and hospitality  
Event organizers will have varying levels of responsibility for arranging for housing  
and specific guest services depending upon the type of the event and the scope and  
nature of the attendees. Some events such as meetings and conventions require the  
booking of hotel rooms for attendees, with some or all of the rooms to be paid for by  
the event organization. For example, incentive events or corporate events with  
mandatory attendance may be paying all housing costs, conferences with voluntary  
attendance may be paying for only staff and speaker housing yet reserving sufficient  
rooms for self-paying attendees, and conventions or large sports events may be con-  
tracting room blocks with various hotel properties due to the large attendance or the  
need to segregate opposing factions or individual groups.  
The risk manager should confirm that the contracts associated with this housing  
include guarantees based upon reliable attendance projections, attrition procedures  
and costs are clearly specified, the appropriate room pick-up monitoring is taking  
place \(Connell, 2002\), and that restrictions on what charges the organization will  
cover are clearly communicated to the room occupant as well as the hotel \(Silvers,  
2004a\). Housing is sometimes handled in-house or contracted out to a housing  
bureau, and housing forms will need to be included in the registration process and  
materials \(Krug, 2000\). It is advised that the event organization avoid taking any  
responsibilities regarding room sharing, making the matching of roommates a self-  
selection process.  
Reception areas, ready rooms, dressing rooms, and lounge facilities may need to  
be acquired for participants such as speakers, entertainers, sports teams, sponsors,  
dignitaries, or officiates. The accessibility and proximity of these facilities should be  
carefully considered from logistical, hospitality, and political perspectives. Food,  
beverage, equipment, and other amenities may be desired or contractually required,  
special access routes and admittance controls may be needed, and specific distances  
from or between certain facilities may be necessary.  
Hospitality functions and suites, typically hosted by sponsors of the event, may be  
included in or in conjunction with the event. The event organization may be intimately IO  
306 Risk Management for Meetings and Events  
involved in the scheduling and placement of such ancillary events or the events may  
occur without direct involvement by the main event's organizer. However, since these  
functions and suites are meant to attract the main event's attendees, there will be a per-  
ceived affiliation that might create a level of liability for the main event. Therefore, it is  
advisable to establish clear policies and procedures that limit such liability \(e.g.,  
co-location, alcohol service, or activities\). This will need to be incorporated into spon-  
sorship agreements to ensure client entertainment activities at the event meet the same  
standards as the main event's and are incorporated into risk assessments.  
Customer service  
Anticipating needs and the courteous and conscientious delivery of the services to  
meet those needs is the foundation of good customer service. In addition, managing  
expectations \(i.e., establishing and clearly communicating what the customer can  
expect\) will increase the probability of customer satisfaction. This is applicable  
throughout the attendee’s interaction and involvement with the event from the  
admissions procedures to the event attractions to the departure and any post-event  
contact. The risk manager should confirm that the systems are in place to deliver  
quality customer service because dissatisfaction can lead to image degradation, dis-  
ruptive behavior, or lawsuits.  
For example, if attendees at a training conference require the tracking and record-  
ing of continuing education credits for credential maintenance, attendance tracking  
software and hardware \(e.g., badge scanning equipment\) may need to be in place. If  
exhibitors at a trade show have been promised a mailing list of attendees for their  
pre- and post-event marketing activities, registered attendees need to be advised  
that this will occur \(and perhaps given the option for non-inclusion\). If seating at a  
convention’s gala banquet needs to be assigned \(to prevent a rush for seats or the  
age-old and dangerous practice of guests tipping a chair against the table to indicate  
it has been saved for someone\), perhaps a ticket exchange table needs to be provided  
so that attendees exchange a reservation coupon or ticket in their registration pack-  
age for a table assignment based upon a first come/first serve basis.  
Advising the attendee of what to expect and the prohibition of certain items or  
behaviors will facilitate a positive experience for them and will lessen the risks for  
the event. Preparing all personnel that will have contact with the attendee, from call  
centers to ticket collectors, with methods and materials or devices for providing  
timely and useful assistance will facilitate an effective level of control and excellent  
level of service. Then, when the inevitable problems do occur, both sides in this  
human exchange will be more amenable and predisposed to cooperation rather than  
confrontation.  
# Summary  
A key characteristic of events of all types is the assembly of a group of people. This  
can be a joyous and exciting experience or a frightening and dangerous situation  
depending on how well that assembly is managed. The type, scope, and purpose of  
the event, as well as the characteristics and objectives of the audience, will define the  
strategies and tactics to be used to ensure the appropriate behavior of and the  
orderly movement to and through the event by the assembled crowds. ——————— a i esl SS  
Attendee management 307  
Most events will require some sort of access or admittance control\: a ticket, a  
badge, a pass, or simply being counted to get an accurate attendance. In recognition  
that controlling access is an important loss prevention as well as crowd safety strat-  
egy, many events utilize equipment and features to control access into the event site,  
as well as specific seating plans and credentials to limit access to certain areas within  
an event site. Understanding crowd capacity, characteristics, and cues will allow the  
risk manager to effectively supervise and monitor crowd conditions and implement  
the appropriate crowd control responses.  
The event risk manager must analyze the physical and behavioral factors that could  
influence a crowd and incorporate the appropriate crowd controls necessary to mitigate  
negative outcomes. The risk manager should make every attempt to preempt the possi-  
bility of undesirable behavior or hazardous conditions by clarifying the desirable behav-  
ior and safe conditions, and then implementing the appropriate plans and operational  
procedures that support these and eliminate permission-givers for deviant behavior.  
The appropriate layout and accessibility must be designed into the site, the appropriate  
personnel must be trained and positioned properly, and the appropriate messages must  
be communicated to the audience both before the event and during the event.  
The way in which the event organization prepares and provides facilities for the  
attendee will influence not only the attendee’s behavior; it will shape the event expe-  
rience and attendee’s level of satisfaction with that experience. It is very rare that  
attendees come with intent to disrupt the event or create unsafe conditions, although  
that is a possibility, but they often do not realize what effect they can have on the  
safety and security of the rest of the audience. It is not their job to make sure disor-  
der or hazardous conditions are prevented; it is yours. However, the attendee can  
become a partner in managing these risks if their needs and behaviors are antici-  
pated and shaped with clear and carefully designed systems and interactions.  
Key safeguards  
e Ensure that there are sufficient entry and exit portals and they are kept completely  
clear of all obstacles.  
¢ Confirm sufficient means of egress including exit route capacity and clarity, exit  
door functionality, and exit discharge area safety.  
Restrict unsafe or unauthorized viewing areas or vantage points.  
Use appropriate crowd barriers to define queuing systems.  
Prevent mass crowd movements between attractions whenever possible.  
Establish, communicate, and enforce rules and prohibitions regarding behavior  
and conditions for entry to ensure a positive influence on crowd behavior.  
¢ Continually monitor crowd conditions and behavior.  
e Make certain crowds are given accurate information and timely advisories.  
e Infuse all attendee systems, controls, and interactions with customer service.

A high level politician and a very famous movie star are getting married and very much  
want this to remain a private event. The wedding is to take place at a very upscale beach  
resort property \(the place where they met\) and the guest list of 200 includes dignitaries  
and film celebrities from around the world as well as family and friends, most of whom  
will be staying overnight at the resort. The ceremony will take place on the beach and  
the reception will be held in a tent in the gardens of the resort property; however, the  
beach is not private property. Devise an admission system that will control access yet  
maintain the character of this celebration. Be sure to include a risk assessment that iden- .

be used. If the taste and smell \(and appearance in the case of cloudy water\) has not changed, add  
another dose and let stand. If after one half hour the water does not have a chlorine smell, do not  
use it.
