# Praise for the 3rd Edition of Lean UX  
“For the past eight years, Lean UX has been my go-to recommendation for  
teams learning how to work together to design great experiences. This latest  
version goes above and beyond, solidifying the teachings in an  
easy-to-follow format and examples of this working in practice. This is  
required reading for any modern product development team.”  
Melissa Perri, CEO, Produx Labs,  
Senior Lecturer, Harvard Business School  
“Lean UX was such an influential book in my career, and I was thrilled  
to read the newest edition. Jeff and Josh continue to push these ideas  
forward by putting them into practice.”  
David J. Bland, author of Testing Business Ideas  
“As the Siskel and Ebert of the digital product-making process, Gothelf and  
Seiden provide scathingly precise guidance to large organizations undergoing  
their digital transformations. From their combined experience in the field  
spanning the spryest tech startup to century-spanning grown-up  
companies, their guidance is refreshingly more ‘let’s fix this now’ painkiller  
advice from real practitioners than the latest homeotherapy  
cure-all from armchair agilists.”  
John Maeda, SVP Chief Experience Officer, Everbridge “Lean UX is a book that changed how software is made forever...for the  
better. By showing product companies how to design with their customers and  
continuously improving as customers grow and change, Lean UX has enabled  
a new generation of products that not only look good but are good.”  
Christina Wodtke, Lecturer, Stanford Computer Science  
Department, and author of Radical Focus  
“With the latest edition of Lean UX, Jeff and Josh show once again why  
they’ve been thought leaders in design for well over a decade. This book is a  
timeless classic that should be on every designer’s bookshelf.”  
Teresa Torres, author of Continuous Discovery Habits  
“Jeff and Josh have written the definitive book on integrating UX design with  
other aspects of product development, including Agile frameworks like Scrum.  
This edition enhances the tone and the practical ideas around the  
collaborative nature of this work—it’s obvious they are leveraging  
extensive real-world experience in the breaking down of functional silos and  
handoff-based relationships.”  
Gary Pedretti, Professional Scrum Trainer  
and Founder of Sodoto Solutions Praise for Previous Editions of Lean UX  
“The quality of the user experience has become the most important  
differentiator for a company’s product. In Lean UX, Josh Seiden and Jeff  
Gothelf highlight the methods and strategies for ensuring that great  
experiences are built with as little waste as possible in a collaborative, cross-  
functional effort. It is a must-read not just for designers but for everyone  
on the team, from executive leadership to intern.”  
Tom Boates, Founder/CEO of Brilliant  
“If you’re struggling to ship winning user experiences with Agile development  
methods, get this book! Jeff and Josh share proven methods for creative  
ideation, planning, and problem-solving without heavy deliverable baggage.  
The new edition brings some crucial updates, including help  
with designing and tracking experiments, and refinements to  
many of the critical tools of Lean UX.”  
Christian Crumlish, VP Product, 7cups.com; coauthor of  
Designing Social Interfaces, Second Edition  
“In the time since Lean UX was first published, the practices it outlines have  
become widespread. The revised and expanded Lean UX, second edition, will  
show you how to apply Lean UX thinking to both green fields and sustaining  
innovation projects, create the right company culture for success,  
and inspire you with new case studies of Lean UX in practice.”  
Lane Goldstone, Cofounder, Brooklyn Copper Cookware  
“In a very short time span, Lean UX went from an obscure idea to a  
transformative way of building and delivering products that meet the  
customer’s needs. It’s now a critical approach to design and needs to be  
top of mind for every designer, developer, and product manager.”  
Jared Spool, Cofounder, Center Centre UX Design School “Approachable, actionable advice from two people that have been ‘getting out  
of the building’ and evolving Lean UX globally for over a decade. In sharing  
that experience, this book moves beyond theory and brings insights from real  
work done, providing context-rich narratives to digest and fuel UX teams  
working in tandem with the Agile software development process.”  
Courtney Hemphill, Partner at Carbon Five  
“Customer development and Lean Startup changed the way businesses are  
built, because even the smartest teams can’t predict market and user behavior.  
This book brings both methodologies to UX so you can build cheaper,  
faster, and—most importantly—better experiences.”  
Alex Osterwalder, author and entrepreneur;  
Cofounder, Business Model Foundry GmbH  
“There is a revolution afoot. It is the move away from big design up front and  
isolated, specialized teams throwing documents over the wall to each other.  
Applying the principles of Lean Startups, Jeff and Josh lay out the principles of  
Lean UX, which can literally transform the way you bring experiences to life.  
I have firsthand experience applying their wisdom and am excited  
about taking Agile to the next level. Get this book. But most  
importantly, put this book into practice.”  
Bill Scott, Sr. Director, User Interface Engineering, PayPal, Inc.  
“While there is no question that great product teams must put user experience  
design front and center, many teams have struggled to reconcile the techniques  
and objectives of user experience design with the rhythm and pace  
of modern Agile development teams. Lean UX is the collection of techniques  
and mindset that I advocate to modern product teams that know  
they need the benefits of both.”  
Marty Cagan, Founder, Silicon Valley Product Group;  
former SVP Product and Design, eBay “Jeff and Josh’s passion for getting UX \(and, really, all of product  
development\) right comes across powerfully in this detailed yet eminently  
readable book. The case studies, examples, and research serve to highlight the  
power of building a Lean UX process, and there’s a great deal of actionable  
advice taken from these. I’m ordering a copy for everyone on our  
design, UX, and product teams at Moz.”  
Rand Fishkin, CEO and Cofounder, Moz  
“A fantastic combination of case studies and practical advice that your team  
can use today. Whether you’re at a startup or a Fortune 500 company,  
this book will change the way you build products.”  
Laura Klein, author of UX for Lean Startups  
“Lean UX provides a prescriptive framework for how to build better products,  
moving design away from pixel perfection for the sake of it toward iterative  
learning, smarter effort, and outcome-based results. Product managers,  
business owners, and startup employees—along with designers—  
can benefit greatly from Lean UX.

CONTENTS XIII Forewords  
In reading Lean UX, you’re about to embark on a tour of a new way of work-  
ing. For those of us steeped in traditional management techniques, it may seem  
a little disorienting. I sometimes like to imagine what it would be like to have a  
bird’s-eye view of the typical modern corporation. From on high, in your  
mind’s eye you could examine each silo of functional excellence one at a time\:  
Marketing, Operations, Manufacturing, IT, Engineering, Design, and on and  
on in a tidy row of crisp, well-run silos.  
Let’s imagine you reached down to grab one of these silos and popped its top  
off to see inside. What would you see? This being a modern company, you’d  
see each silo designed for maximum efficiency. To achieve this efficiency, you’d  
likely find a highly iterative, customer-centric approach to problem-solving. In  
Manufacturing, you’d encounter traditional Lean thinking. In Engineering or  
IT, perhaps some variation on Agile development. In Marketing, customer  
development. In Operations, DevOps. And of course in Design, the latest in  
design thinking, interaction design, and user research techniques.  
Zooming back out to our high perch, we might be forgiven for thinking, “This  
company uses a variety of rigorous, hypothesis-driven, customer-centric, and  
iterative methodologies. Surely, it must be an extremely agile company, capable  
of reacting quickly to changes in market conditions and continuously innovat-  
ing!” But those of us who work in modern companies know how far this is  
from the truth.  
How is it possible that our departmental silos are operating with agility but  
our companies are hopelessly rigid and slow? From our far-off vantage point,  
we have missed something essential. Although our departments may value agil-  
ity, the interconnections between them are still mired in an antiquated indus-  
trial past.  
Consider just one example, which I hope will sound familiar. A company  
decides it must innovate to survive. It commissions a design team \(either  
in-house or external\) to investigate the future of its industry and recommend  
innovative new products that could secure its future. A period of great  
excitement commences. Customers are interviewed, observed, analyzed.  
XV Experiments, surveys, focus groups, prototypes, and smoke tests follow one  
after the other. Concepts are rapidly conceived, tested, rejected, and refined.  
And what happens at the end of this process? The designers proudly present—  
and the business enthusiastically celebrates—a massive specification document  
with their findings and recommendations. The iteration, experimentation, and  
discovery ceases. Now Engineering is called upon to execute this plan. And  
although the engineering process may be agile, the specification document is  
rigidly fixed. What happens if the engineers discover that the specification was  
unworkable or even slightly flawed? What if the concepts worked great in the  
lab but have no commercial appeal? What if market conditions have changed  
since the original “learning” took place?  
I once spoke to a company that had commissioned—at terrible expense—a  
multiyear study of their industry. The result was an impressive “view of the  
future” display custom-built into their corporate headquarters. Inside this  
room, you could see an extrapolation of what the next 10 years would look  
like in their industry, complete with working demos of futuristic product con-  
cepts. You can guess what happened over the succeeding 10 years\: absolutely  
nothing. The company rotated hundreds or thousands of executives, managers,  
and workers through this glimpse of the future. And in fact, 10 years later, the  
room no longer looks futuristic. Against all odds, their forecasts turned out to  
be largely accurate. And yet, the company had failed to commercialize even  
one of the recommendations in the attendant specification document. So I  
asked the company what they planned to do next. They told me they were  
going back to the original designers and asking them to forecast the next 10  
years! The company blamed their engineers and managers, not the designers,  
for their failure to commercialize.  
When I tell this story to nondesigners, they are horrified and want to convince  
me that it is the fancy design firm that is to blame. When I tell it to senior exec-  
utives—in both large companies and startups alike—they cringe. They are con-  
stantly deluged with complaints from every single function that they are fast  
and cutting edge, but it is the other departments that slow the company down.  
When the whole company fails to find new sources of growth, there is plenty  
of blame to go around.  
But the fault is not with the designers, the engineers, or even the executives.  
The problem is the systems we use to build companies. We are still building  
linear organizations in a world that demands constant change. We are still  
building silos in a world that demands thorough collaboration. And we are  
still investing in analysis, arguing over specifications, and efficiently producing  
deliverables in a world that demands continuous experimentation in order to  
achieve continuous innovation.  
XVI LEAN UX When this book first came out in 2012, it was still early days for Lean Startup.  
It’s now been fifteen years since I first began writing and speaking about what  
was then a very new concept, and 2021 is also the tenth anniversary of the  
publication of The Lean Startup\: How Today’s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous  
Innovation to Achieve Radically Successful Businesses \(Crown Business, 2011\).  
In that time, I have seen the ideas grow and spread—from industry to industry,  
sector to sector, and function to function. Every time we have encountered new  
terrain, we have relied on farsighted leaders to help translate the core princi-  
ples and develop new processes to implement them. We’ve learned an enor-  
mous amount about how it can be used, and practitioners all over the world  
have contributed new tools and methods.  
Lean UX is an important step in that evolution. And thanks to Jeff Gothelf  
and Josh Seiden’s commitment to continuing to advance the discipline, this  
new edition builds on what was already a comprehensive look at how Lean  
Startup principles apply in a design context. The fundamental tools and techni-  
ques it introduces for achieving superior collaboration, faster delivery, and—  
most importantly—dramatically better products have been augmented to  
include newer entries like the Lean UX Canvas and Hypothesis Prioritization  
Canvas. There’s more on the relationship between Lean UX and story map-  
ping, too, as well as on design sprints.  
Lean Startup is a big tent. It builds on established ideas from many disciplines,  
from Lean manufacturing to design thinking. It gives us a common vocabulary  
and set of concepts that can be used to accelerate results across the whole com-  
pany. We can stop wasting time arguing about who is to blame and which  
department should rule the day.  
It is my hope that all of us will remember to heed Jeff’s call to “get out of the  
deliverables business” and return our focus to where it belongs, enlisting the  
whole corporation in its most urgent task\: delighting customers.  
It is time to break down the silos, unite the clans, and get to work.

XVII This edition of Lean UX is a timely contribution to the evolving world of  
design, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Ten years ago, part of our work  
with companies involved having to convince leaders of the value of innovation  
beyond their core business. This debate has now mostly gone away. Corporate  
leaders are now convinced that innovation is the best way to drive long-term  
growth within their companies.  
While leaders now see the value of innovation, a different challenge still  
remains. Very few leaders are satisfied with their company’s innovation perfor-  
mance. It appears that a lot of the work that innovation teams do does not fol-  
low a repeatable process. This is the question that leaders now consistently ask  
us\: what are the structures and processes they need to put in place to have  
repeatable innovation?  
This is what makes this edition of Lean UX so timely. We believe that innova-  
tion is a profession, not simply a calling for the chosen few. In order to profes-  
sionalize innovation, we need to develop the right tools and processes for inno-  
vators to use in their day-to-day work. As people learn to use these tools, they  
will then be able to produce repeatable value for their organizations. This is  
the ongoing contribution that Lean UX is making.  
Even after the publication of the first edition of Lean UX, the biggest lie in  
software and product development is still phase two. The idea is that teams  
should be allowed to execute on whatever they have on their road map and  
then deal with any customer issues after launching \(i.e., in the second version  
of the product\). The problem is that we never get to phase two, and flawed  
products remain in the market. This is probably why 7 out of 10 new product  
launches flop.  
So how do we solve this challenge? First, we need to develop tools that fit the  
nature of innovation. Lean UX is based on the clear understanding that inno-  
vation is not a technological or execution challenge. Instead, the challenge for  
teams is to search for value propositions that resonate with customers and for  
business models that are profitable.  
XVIII LEAN UX Such searching requires that teams navigate complexity and uncertainty. This is  
not a linear process based on simple cause and effect. It is a nonlinear process.  
Lean UX provides ways for teams to navigate this complexity by moving itera-  
tively and creatively through the murky waters of innovation until they find  
something that works.  
We once worked with a leader who kept asking his teams to bring him 10x  
ideas. We tried to gently remind the leader that it would be impossible for him  
and his team to identify a 10x idea on day one. Leaders cannot pick winning  
ideas; they can only create the context in which the best ideas emerge. By fol-  
lowing the process laid out in Lean UX, teams can work together to quickly  
sketch out and test their business ideas. The winning ideas will emerge through  
that testing and iteration.  
The complexity of innovation also means that teams cannot navigate their way  
to success without collaborating with colleagues from various key functions.  
There is quite a distance to travel between having an idea and then designing,  
testing, and launching that idea into the market. Such work requires cross-  
functional collaboration. The challenge is that a lot of organizations still main-  
tain the silos and handoffs that kill the ability of teams to collaborate.  
We have worked with several organizations where innovation teams need to  
get the approval of legal and compliance to run experiments. At one such orga-  
nization, it took over two months for a simple Wizard of Oz experiment to be  
approved. Lean UX describes practical ways that can be used to overcome  
such barriers to innovation.  
Even after the product launches, the mindset articulated in Lean UX helps  
teams to continue sketching and testing. It is critical that teams don’t treat the  
launch of a product as the end of the process. It is critical that they continue to  
improve their offering using Lean UX methods. It is important to always  
remember that companies are not in the business of deliverables; they are in  
the business of delighting customers!  
We hope that you not only enjoy reading this wonderful book, but that you  
also take the lessons and apply them to your day-to-day work.

XIX Authors’ Note  
As we set out to write the third edition of this book, we realized that the influ-  
ence of an ever-diverse group of practitioners, writers, coaches, and consul-  
tants has helped Lean UX grow and evolve to meet the changing needs of soft-  
ware design and development. We wanted to take a moment to thank them.  
We continue to learn from the core group of colleagues and fellow road warri-  
ors who share their wisdom and feedback with us, including Tendayi Viki, Ter-  
esa Torres, Melissa Perri, Hope Gurion, Barry O’Reilly, Sam McAfee, Andy  
Polaine, David Bland, Andi Plantenberg, Jonathan Bertfield, Kate Leto, Daniel  
Stillman, Beth Temple, Jocelyn Miller, Bob Gower, David Bland, Douglas Fer-  
guson, Martina Hodges-Schell, Erin Stadler, Jeff Patton, Petra Wille, Janet  
Bumpas, Jonathan Berger, and Adrian Howard. We build our ideas on top of  
theirs and those of our clients.  
As always, we would like to thank the many folks who have contributed mate-  
rial, stories, research leads, Twitter help, technical wisdom, and emotional sup-  
port to the book. In particular, we’d like to thank Andrew Bourne, Ike Breed,  
Steven Cohn, Regine Gilbert, Victor M. Gonzalez, Zach Gottlieb, Jamila Isoke,  
Liz Laub, Jon Loyens, Dan Maccarone, Jono Mallanyk, Lin Nie, Greg Petroff,  
Steve Portigal, Leisa Reichelt, Delphine Sassi, Alexander Schardt, Kristin Skin-  
ner, Erik Skogsberg, Jessica Tiao, Kate Towsey, Ben Walker, Rosie Webster, and  
Lee Weiss.  
We’re grateful to the team at Scrum.org, including Dave West, Steve Porter,  
Erik Weber, and Gary Pedretti, and all of the professional Scrum trainers we  
met there who helped bring our work to the Scrum community and who hel-  
ped us sharpen our understanding of the needs of that community.  
Thanks to Eric Ries for continuing to support the work of Lean UX and the  
other authors and titles in the Lean Series, and to Melissa Duffield, Angela  
Rufino, Mary Treseler, and Jennifer Pollock at O’Reilly, who continue to make  
it possible for this book to succeed.  
XX LEAN UX Finally, we’d be remiss if we didn’t thank the members of the Balanced Team  
working group, where we first started workshopping these ideas all those years  
ago. We’re grateful to Lane Goldstone for being the catalyst and driving force  
in bringing that group together and bringing so many wonderful people  
together. In particular, we owe a debt of gratitude to Janice Fraser, who first  
introduced us to the ideas of Lean Startup and who coined the phrase “Lean  
UX.”  
# Note\: From Jeff  
As our partnership enters its second decade, I continue to see Josh as a friend,  
collaborator, and logical sounding board. The way we practice these ideas is  
different from the days we first started doing it, but as the needs of the market  
and the realities of the world change, we continue to work together to find  
new ways to bring better ways of working to the corporate world. I’m grateful  
for that and for his relentless pursuit of the perfect homemade sourdough and  
corned beef.  
As always, none of this happens without family support and love. Carrie,  
Grace, and Sophie continue to indulge my work, my writing, and my dad  
jokes. I couldn’t ask for more. I love you all. Thank you.  
# Note\: From Josh  
In this book, Jeff and I describe a working style that is deeply collaborative.  
That’s my preferred style of working—I always feel that I learn more and am  
more effective when I’m collaborating. Whatever I’ve been able to contribute  
to this book is a result of the amazing collaborations I’ve been lucky enough to  
enjoy in my career. You all know who you are. I’m very grateful to all of you.  
There is one working collaboration that I do need to call out, though\: it’s been  
a real pleasure to continue to collaborate with Jeff. Jeff supplies many of the  
things in this partnership that I can’t, including optimism about deadlines,  
audacity in setting goals, and tirelessness in evangelizing. He’s a smart, hard-  
working, and egoless partner. He is not, however, funny. If that’s needed, I usu-  
ally have to provide it.

Another five years have passed since we last updated this book. We continue to  
be in awe of the community and the work that the ideas in this book have  
spawned. So much has changed, and yet so many of the problems that soft-  
ware design and development teams face remain the same. The challenge has  
always been to build not only broader cross-functional collaboration but a  
AUTHORS’ NOTE  
XXI continuous conversation with the customer that influences what work we  
choose to do. The good news is that, with the deeper assimilation of Agile and  
Scrum, along with the goal-setting framework of objectives and key results  
\(OKRs\), organizations are taking an even closer look at how to become nim-  
bler and more customer-centric. We, too, have learned how the techniques in  
Lean UX can be applied even more effectively. We’re excited to share that with  
you.  
Every time we teach Lean UX or use it in our daily work, we learn a better  
way to apply it. We try something new, inspect it, adapt from the learning, and  
update our thinking. We suspect you’re doing the same thing, and we’d love to  
hear about it.  
Please keep in touch with us and share your thoughts. You can reach us at

hearing from you.  
XXII LEAN UX Preface  
The biggest lie in software is still phase two.  
If you’ve spent any time building digital products in the past 30 years—regard-  
less of your role—you’ve felt the sting of this lie. And if your team claims to be  
agile, is phase two still a valid concept? Teams prioritize features and ideas for  
each sprint, racing toward a launch date while pushing nonprioritized ideas to  
the next phase of work. Except that phase never comes, and those features are  
gone—never to be heard from again. As designers, product managers, coaches,  
and consultants, we’ve had hundreds, if not thousands, of wireframes, product  
backlog items, and workflows end up in this same bucket.  
But were these ideas abandoned because they were flawed? Because something  
changed in the market? Did the features that shipped actually meet customer  
and business goals? Or did the team simply forget? They never got to phase  
two.  
In The Lean Startup, Eric Ries lays out his vision for how to ensure the ideas  
that have the most value get the most resources. The method Ries promotes  
relies on experimentation, rapid iterations of ideas, and evolutionary processes.  
In a truly agile environment, teams launch features continuously, making the  
actual deployment of code a nonevent. The entire concept of phase two has  
become moot.  
The junction of Lean Startup and user experience \(UX\) design—and their sym-  
biotically beneficial coexistence—is Lean UX.  
XXIII What Is Lean UX?  
The Lean principles underlying Lean Startup apply to Lean UX in three ways.  
First, they help us remove waste from our UX design process. We do just  
enough work—be it design, research, writing, whatever—to move the conver-  
sation between design, development, and product forward. These minimally  
viable conversations move us away from the lengthy negotiations triggered by  
heavily documented handoffs. Instead, a Lean UX process creates only the  
design artifacts we need to move the team’s learning forward. Second, Lean  
principles drive us to harmonize our “system” of designers, developers, prod-  
uct managers, quality assurance engineers, marketers, and others in a transpar-  
ent, cross-functional collaboration that brings nondesigners into our design  
process. Lean UX is a transparent process that not only reveals what designers  
do but encourages participation from everyone on the team.  
Last, and perhaps most important, is the mindset shift we gain from adopting  
a model based on experimentation and validated learning. Instead of relying  
on any one person—a hero designer, the lead engineer, a business stakeholder  
—to divine the best solution from a single point of view, we use rapid experi-  
mentation and measurement to take an outside-in view of the experience we’re  
creating. We push to learn quickly—to discover—how well \(or poorly\) our  
ideas meet the needs of our customers. In all of this, the designer’s role begins  
to evolve beyond just creation of artifacts toward design facilitation—and with  
that, we take on a new set of responsibilities.  
Besides Lean Startup, Lean UX has two other foundations\: design thinking and  
Agile development philosophies. Design thinking helps us widen the scope of  
our work beyond interfaces and artifacts. Design thinking looks at systems and  
helps us apply design tools to broader problems. It relies on collaboration, iter-  
ation, making, and empathy as core to problem-solving. Perhaps the biggest  
takeaway from design thinking is its focus on building empathy—teamwide—  
for the end user. Practicing Lean UX means the entire team builds this empa-  
thy. Agile refocuses software development on shorter cycles, regular delivery of  
value, and continuous learning. It seeks to get ideas \(oftentimes as working  
software\) to customers quickly, sense how these ideas are received, and  
respond frequently to new learning along the way. As the Scrum guide puts it\:  
inspect and adapt.  
Lean UX uses these foundations to bridge the speed of Agile and the need for  
design in the product-development life cycle. If you’ve struggled to figure out  
how UX design can work in Agile environments, Lean UX is the answer.  
XXIV  
LEAN UX Lean UX breaks down the barriers that have kept software designers isolated  
from real business needs on the one hand and actual implementation on the  
other. Lean UX not only brings designers to the table, but it brings our part-  
ners in product management, business, and technology to the whiteboard to  
work with us on the best solutions in an ongoing way.  
Early in his career, Jeff worked with a large pharmaceutical client who had  
hired the agency he worked for to redesign their ecommerce platform. The  
goal was to increase revenues by 15%. Jeff was the lead interaction designer  
on the team. In the vacuum of their office, Jeff and his team spent months  
researching the current system, supply chain, competitors, target audience, and  
contextual use scenarios. They researched personas and assembled strategic  
models. Jeff designed a new information architecture for the product catalog  
and crafted a brand-new shopping and checkout experience.  
The project took months. And when the work was complete, the team pack-  
aged it all up into a PowerPoint slide deck. This was a formidable deck—and it  
had to be, considering the \$600,000 price tag! The team went over to the cli-  
ent’s office and spent an entire eight-hour day going over each and every pixel  
and word in that deck. When it was over, the client clapped. \(They really did.\)  
Jeff and the team were relieved. The client loved the work. And Jeff’s team  
never looked at that deck again.  
Six months after that meeting, nothing had changed on the client’s site. The cli-  
ent never looked at that deck again, either.  
The moral of this story\: building a pixel-perfect specification might be a route  
to rake in six-figure consulting fees, but it’s not a way to make a meaningful  
difference to a real product that is crucial to real users. It’s also not the reason  
that any designer got into the product design business. We got in it to build  
valuable products and services, not to write specs.  
When we practice Lean UX, we ensure we’re solving a real problem for real  
customers in a meaningful way. Some teams we work with today create  
entirely new products or services. They are not working within an existing  
product framework or structure. In “greenfield” projects like these, we are  
simultaneously trying to discover how this new product or service will be used,  
how it will behave, and how we are going to build it. Most importantly, we  
want to validate that it’s solving a meaningful problem for its intended target  
audience. This is an environment of continual change, and there isn’t a lot of  
time or patience for planning or up-front design.  
Other teams work with established products that were created with traditional  
design and development methods. Their challenge is different. The systems  
they work on were developed to meet the needs of a specific period of time.  
The rapid pace of change in the market means that those needs have likely  
PREFACE XXV evolved. These teams need to optimize these existing platforms to meet new  
realities while increasing revenue and brand value. They usually have more  
resources at their disposal than a ground-floor startup, but they still have to  
use their resources efficiently—discovering the best way to spend those resour-  
ces to build products and services their customers actually want.  
Perhaps one of the toughest changes Lean UX asks us to make is to overcome  
the feeling that we are showing work in an “unfinished” or “ugly” state. Even  
today, after nearly 15 years of working this way, we still struggle with this one.  
We’ve learned over the years that our first attempt will inevitably require revi-  
sion. So the sooner we get our ideas out, the sooner we can figure out what  
those revisions should be. Waiting too long to get that feedback is wasteful. We  
invest too much in the initial design and are less flexible to changes because of  
the effort we’ve already put in. The sooner we learn what changes need to be  
made, the less we’ve invested in the current idea. It will hurt less to change  
course. Accepting the iterative nature of design and, more broadly, software  
requires the support of a high-functioning, humble, collaborative team. You  
need to know—as a team—that you’re not going to get it right the first time  
and that you’re all working together to iterate your way forward. The deploy-  
ment of the code is not the measure of a Lean UX team’s success. It’s the posi-  
tive impact you have on your customers.  
There are many elements that affect the success of digital systems. Design is  
certainly an important component, but product management, engineering,  
marketing, legal, compliance, and copywriting \(to name a few\) all have an  
impact on the system. No one discipline has all the answers. To that end, no  
one point of view has all the answers, either. The greater the diversity of your  
team—gender diversity, racial diversity, etc.—the more innovative and broad-  
reaching the solutions the team generates. Inclusivity is key to a successful col-  
laboration. This is the nature of our digital medium. Broad collaboration cre-  
ates better work. Revision and iteration make for better products. Within the  
pages of this book, we’ve distilled the insights and tactics that have allowed us  
to adopt this point of view and to create real success for product and business  
teams—and real satisfaction for customers.  
# Who Is Lean UX For?  
This book is, first, for product designers who know they can contribute more  
and be more effective with their teams. That said, we believe that “user experi-  
ence” is the sum total of all of the interactions that a user has with your prod-  
uct and service. It’s created by all of the decisions that you and your team  
make about that product or service. It’s not just user interface or functionality.  
It’s also about pricing, purchasing experience, onboarding, support, etc. In  
other words, user experience is created by the whole team. For that reason,  
XXVI  
LEAN UX this book is also for product managers who need better ways to define their  
products with their teams and to validate them with their customers. It’s also  
for Scrum masters and developers who understand that a collaborative, agile  
team environment leads to better code and more meaningful work. And,  
finally, it’s for managers—managers of UX teams, project teams, business lines,  
departments, and companies—who understand the difference a great UX can  
make.  
# What’s in It for You?  
The book is set up in four sections.  
Part I, Introduction and Principles, provides an overview and introduction to  
Lean UX and its founding principles. We lay out the reasons the evolution of  
the UX design process is so critical and describe Lean UX. We also discuss the  
underlying principles that you’ll need to understand to make Lean UX success-  
ful in your Agile work environments.  
Part II, Process, introduces the Lean UX canvas and walk through each of its  
eight steps. We also share examples of how we and others have done these  
things in the past.  
Part III, Collaboration, takes a deep look at collaboration between designers  
and other disciplines, and introduces tools and case studies to bring together  
several popular ways of working, like design sprints, design systems, and col-  
laborative research with Lean UX. Finally, we share some considerations for  
better integrating Lean UX into the rhythms of an Agile process.  
Part IV, Lean UX in Your Organization, tackles the integration of Lean UX  
practices into your organization. We discuss the organizational shifts that need  
to take place at the corporate level, team level, and individual contributor level  
for these ideas to truly take hold.  
Our hope is that this book will continue to serve as a way forward for UX  
designers, their colleagues, and product teams in all organizations still waiting  
for “phase two.” Although the book is filled with tactics and techniques to  
help develop your processes, we’d like you to remember that Lean UX is, at its  
core, a mindset.

LEAN UX PART I  
# INTRODUCTION AND  
# PRINCIPLES  
# About Part I  
In this first part, we provide an introduction to Lean UX and its founding prin-  
ciples. We discuss why the evolution of the product design and development  
process is so critical, and we describe what Lean UX is. We also discuss the  
underlying principles you’ll need to understand to make Lean UX work in  
your organization.  
Chapter 1, More Important Now than Ever Before, provides a brief history of  
product design and development and why it’s time for that process to evolve.  
In Chapter 2, Principles, we present a detailed look at the key principles that  
drive the Lean UX process. These principles offer a framework for a leaner  
product design and discovery process, and also provide basic management  
guidelines for these teams. They are critical to the success of Lean UX and, if  
incorporated into your organization, will have a profound impact on your cul-  
ture and on the productivity and success of your teams.  
1 Chapter 3, Outcomes, is focused on the idea of outcomes, which have always  
been an important concept in Lean UX, but over the years, we’ve developed  
new ways of thinking about and working with them. Because outcomes are so  
critical to Lean UX, we’ve expanded our discussion of this concept. This chap-  
ter shares with you our current understanding of the idea.

# More Important Now than Ever Before  
It’s not iteration if you do it only once.  
Jeff Patton  
# Design Is Always Evolving  
When designers first brought their craft to software in the ’80s and ’90s, they  
approached the work in the same way they approached the earlier materials  
they worked with. In industrial design, print design, fashion design, or any  
field involving physical outputs, the manufacturing step is a critical constraint.  
When designing for physical materials, designers need to figure out what  
they’re making before they begin production, because production is expensive.  
It’s expensive to set up a factory floor to produce hard goods or garments. It’s  
expensive to set up a printing press for a print run.  
Working in software, designers faced new challenges. They had to figure out  
the grammar of this new medium, and as they did, they saw new specialties  
like interaction design and information architecture emerge. But the process by  
which designers practiced remained mostly unquestioned. Designers still  
designed products in great detail in advance, because they still had to deal with  
a “manufacturing” process\: the work had to be duplicated onto floppy disks  
and CDs, which were then distributed to market in exactly the same way that  
physical goods were distributed. The cost of getting it wrong remained high.  
Paradoxically, though, this way of working didn’t really prevent anyone from  
getting it wrong. Too often, designers worked in isolation—siloed—before  
passing their work to developers, who in turn worked in a silo before passing  
the work on to QA, and so on. And everyone was working with limited mar-  
ket feedback.  
3 Today, we face a new reality. Software production has become continuous. The  
internet has changed the way we distribute software. The proliferation of  
mobile devices, wearables, and the Internet of Things has changed the way we  
consume it. We are no longer limited by a physical manufacturing process, and  
we are able to get our digital products and services into customers’ hands at a  
pace unheard of just a few years ago.  
This changes everything.  
Teams now are facing intense pressure from competitors who are using techni-  
ques like Agile software development, continuous integration, and continuous  
deployment to radically reduce their cycle times. Take Amazon as an example.  
The ecommerce giant pushes new code live to their customers every single sec-  
ond of every minute.  
1 And they are using these short cycles as a competitive  
advantage—releasing early and often, gaining market feedback, and iterating  
based on what they learn to create a continuous conversation with customers.  
In essence, they are discovering their product at the same time they are deliver-  
ing it. This has many results, but these are perhaps the two most important  
ones\:  
• The ability to learn, continuously and quickly, how well their products are  
meeting customer needs  
• Raising customer expectations in terms of product quality and company  
response times to their concerns and feedback  
What’s more, this new way of working is not based on expensive technologies.  
The platforms and services that make this possible are available for free or  
nearly free to just about every startup team. This exposes incumbent businesses  
to a threat they haven’t known before. Specifically, the barriers to entry—in  
almost every domain—have never been lower. Without the need to “manufac-  
ture” a physical product, anyone with access to the web can design, code, and  
deploy services to anyone else. Faced with these new threats, traditional “get it  
all figured out first” approaches are simply not workable. So what should  
product teams do?  
It’s time for a change.

LEAN UX Lean UX is the evolution of product design and team collaboration. It takes  
the best parts of the designer’s toolkit, combines that with Agile software  
development and Lean Startup thinking, and makes all of this available to the  
entire product team. It allows teams to exploit this new reality to maximize  
learning, continuously discover the best path forward, and amplify the voice of  
the customer.  
Lean UX is deeply collaborative and cross-functional because designers, prod-  
uct managers, and software engineers no longer have the luxury of working in  
isolation from each other. The days of the waterfall process are over. Work is  
continuous. We can’t afford to wait on the work of others, nor can we keep  
others waiting on our work. Instead, we need daily, continuous engagement  
with our colleagues if we are going to be successful. This continuous engage-  
ment allows us to strip away heavy deliverables \(and the time required to cre-  
ate them\) in favor of techniques that build shared understanding with our  
teammates. Shared understanding allows our teams to make decisions faster  
and empowers us to engage in more strategic conversations. Yes, we still have  
the responsibility of getting the details right\: crafting beautiful interface ele-  
ments and elegant workflows, and thinking about all the little things that make  
a product design work, from accessibility to page load times, and from button  
labels to error messages. But by eliminating communication overhead, we have  
more time to focus on more fundamental activities like gathering insight that  
can affect strategic choices for our product.  
Lean UX also lets us change the way we talk about design. Instead of talking  
about features and documents, we can talk about what works—the outcomes  
that we are trying to create. In this new reality, we have more access to market  
feedback than ever before. This allows us to reframe design conversations in  
terms of objective business, customer, and user goals. We can measure what  
works, learn, and adjust.  
Lean UX is three things. It begins as a process change for designers and prod-  
uct teams. But it’s much more than that. It’s a culture change that lets us  
approach our work with humility; we acknowledge that our initial solutions  
will probably be wrong and use many sources of insight to continuously  
improve our thinking. Finally, it implies a set of organizational changes to the  
way we organize and manage software design and development teams to be  
more inclusive, collaborative, and transparent. We’ll dig deeply into each of  
these aspects of Lean UX in the rest of the book.  
Perhaps the best way to sum up this introduction, though, is this\: Lean UX is  
the way we need to work now.  
CHAPTER 1\: MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER BEFORE

# Principles  
Go that way. Really fast. If something gets in your way, turn!  
Better Off Dead \(1985\)  
At the heart of Lean UX, you’ll find a core set of principles that govern the  
design process, team culture, and team organization. Treat these principles as a  
framework. Start with them to get your teams pointed in the right direction,  
and keep them in mind as you begin to implement the Lean UX processes we  
describe later in this book. It’s really important to understand that Lean UX is  
not a set of rules. Instead, it’s an approach that you adopt. Given the infinite  
variety of contexts that product teams work within and the different indus-  
tries, companies, cultures, regulations, customers, and missions that designers  
serve, it’s inevitable that you will need to adjust the processes we describe to  
make them work in your organization. The principles in this chapter will pro-  
vide guidance to help you make those adjustments.  
Ultimately, if you’re able to apply principles, you’ll find that you will change  
your team’s culture. Some principles will have more impact than others, and  
some will be more difficult to act on. Regardless, each principle described here  
will help you to build a product design organization that is more collaborative,  
more cross-functional, and a better fit for today’s agile reality.  
# The Foundations of Lean UX  
Lean UX stands on a number of important foundations\: it’s a combination of a  
few different schools of thought. Understanding where it comes from will help  
you to apply the methods and find resources when you get stuck.  
7 The first foundation of Lean UX is user experience design. Lean UX is, at its  
heart, a way of practicing user experience design. Drawing on roots in the  
fields of human factors and ergonomics as well as the human-centered design  
ideas that emerged in the 1950s with the work of industrial designers like  
Henry Dreyfuss, these methods and mindsets are known today as user experi-  
ence design \(or just UX\), a term credited to Don Norman.1 UX embraces a  
number of design fields, including interaction design, information architecture,  
graphic design, and many others. But the heart of UX practice is that it begins  
by identifying human needs—the needs of the users of the system.  
In the past decade, we’ve seen the rise in popularity of design thinking. Design  
thinking emerged in the academy in the 1970s and 1980s and was popularized  
by the design firm IDEO in the early 2000s. It is a way of applying human-  
centered design methods to a wide range of problems. Tim Brown, CEO and  
president of IDEO, described design thinking as “innovation powered  
by...direct observation of what people want and need in their lives and what  
they like or dislike about the way particular products are made, packaged,  
marketed, sold, and supported.”2  
Brown continued\: “\[it’s\] a discipline that uses the designer’s sensibility and  
methods to match people’s needs with what is technologically feasible and  
what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market  
opportunity.”  
Design thinking is important for Lean UX because it takes the explicit position  
that every aspect of a business \(or any other system\) can be approached with  
design methods. It gives designers permission to work beyond their typical  
boundaries. It also encourages nondesigners to use design methods to solve the  
problems they face in their roles. So UX and its cousin, design thinking, form  
the critical first foundation that encourages teams to consider human needs,  
collaborate with nondesign roles, and approach product design from a holistic  
perspective.  
The next foundation of Lean UX is Agile software development. Software  
developers have been using Agile methods for years to reduce their cycle times,  
build a cadence of continuous learning, and deliver customer value regularly.  
Although Agile methods can pose process challenges for designers \(which we’ll  
show you how to solve in Parts II and III\), the core values of Agile are perfectly  
aligned with Lean UX. Lean UX applies the four core values of Agile develop-  
ment to product design\:

LEAN UX 1\. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.  
Lean UX favors collaboration and conversation over deliverables and rigid  
process. It engages the entire team to generate ideas from diverse points of  
view. It encourages the free and frequent exchange of ideas to allow the  
team to debate, decide, and move forward quickly.  
2\. Working software over comprehensive documentation.  
Every business problem has endless solutions, and each member of a team  
will have an opinion on which is best. The challenge is figuring out which  
solution is most viable. Sometimes, it’s difficult or impossible to predict in  
advance which solution will work. By getting our ideas into the hands of  
customers \(often through working software\) sooner, the team can quickly  
assess solutions for market fit and viability.  
3\. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.  
Collaborating with your teammates and customers builds a shared under-  
standing of the problem space and the proposed solutions. It creates con-  
sensus behind decisions. The result? Faster iterations, real involvement in  
product making, and team investment in validated learning. It also lessens  
dependency on heavy documentation because everyone on the team has  
already participated in making the decisions. Collaboration creates align-  
ment more effectively than written communication, argument, and elabo-  
rate defense.  
4\. Responding to change over following a plan.  
The assumption in Lean UX is that your initial product designs will be at  
least partially wrong, so the team’s goal should be to find out what they  
got wrong as soon as possible. As soon as the team discovers what’s work-  
ing and what’s not, they adjust their proposals and test again. This input  
from the market keeps teams agile, constantly nudging them in a “more  
right” direction.  
The final foundation of Lean UX is Eric Ries’s Lean Startup method. Lean  
Startup uses a feedback loop called “build-measure-learn” to minimize project  
risk and get teams building and learning quickly. Teams build minimum viable  
products \(MVPs\) and ship them quickly to begin the process of learning as  
early as possible.  
CHAPTER 2\: PRINCIPLES  
9 As Eric puts it, “Lean Startup initially advocates the creation of rapid proto-  
types designed to test market assumptions and uses customer feedback to  
evolve them much faster than via more traditional software engineering  
practices.”3  
He continues\: “Lean Startup processes reduce waste by increasing the fre-  
quency of contact with real customers, therefore testing and avoiding incorrect  
market assumptions as early as possible.”  
Lean UX is a direct application of this philosophy to the practice of product  
design.  
Each design is a proposed business solution—a hypothesis. Your goal is to vali-  
date the proposed solution as efficiently as possible by using customer feed-  
back. The smallest thing you can build to test each hypothesis is your MVP.  
The MVP doesn’t need to be made of code\: it can be an approximation of the  
end experience—it might not even be a product! You collect what you learn  
from your MVP and develop your ideas. Then you do it again.  
# So, What Is the Definition of Lean UX?  
Here’s how we define Lean UX\:  
• Lean UX is a design approach that brings the true nature of a product to  
light faster, in a collaborative, cross-functional, and user-centered way.  
• Lean UX methods build a shared understanding of the user, their needs,  
our proposed solutions, and our definition of success.  
• Lean UX prioritizes continuous learning to build evidence for team deci-  
sions and ensure ever-improving delivery of products, services, and value.  
# Principles  
In the rest of this chapter, we’ll lay out the principles behind Lean UX. As you  
explore this approach, keep these principles in mind. Think of your experience  
with Lean UX as a learning journey. Use these principles to keep yourself and  
your team on course.  
We’ve organized these principles into three groups\: principles to guide team  
organization, principles to guide culture, and principles to guide process.

LEAN UXPrinciples to Guide Team Organization  
Let’s begin by taking a look at the Lean UX principles related to team  
organization\:  
• Cross-functional  
• Small, dedicated, colocated  
• Self-sufficient and empowered  
• Problem-focused  
Principle\: Cross-functional  
What is it? Cross-functional teams are made up of the various disciplines  
involved in creating your product. Software engineering, product management,  
interaction design, visual design, content strategy, marketing, quality  
assurance—these all make up a part of Lean UX teams. Lean UX demands a  
high level of collaboration among these disciplines. Their involvement must be  
continuous from day one of the project until the end of the engagement.  
Why do it? Diverse teams create better solutions because each problem is seen  
from many different points of view. Creating diverse teams limits the need for  
gated, handoff-based \(“waterfall”\) processes. Instead, teams can share infor-  
mation informally, which creates collaboration earlier in the process and drives  
greater team efficiency.  
Principle\: Small, dedicated, colocated  
What is it? Keep your teams small—no more than 10 total core people. Dedi-  
cate them to one project and staff it all out of the same location.  
Why do it? The benefit of small teams comes down to three words\: communi-  
cation, focus, and camaraderie. Smaller teams are easier to keep current on  
project status, changes, and new learning. Dedicating your team to one project  
keeps team members focused on the same priorities all the time and eliminates  
dependencies on other teams. Having the team all in one place allows relation-  
ships to grow between colleagues.  
CHAPTER 2\: PRINCIPLES  
11A Note About Colocation  
In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our industry was forced to learn a great deal  
about remote work. We’ll talk about remote work in more depth later in the book, but  
for now, we want to comment on this principle and why we still advocate colocation.  
“Colocation” is about getting people together in the same physical space. We’ve  
learned in the last year that we can gather teams in a shared virtual space and create  
similar experiences. There are some benefits to this way of working \(pajamas, cats, and  
less commuting time\) and some drawbacks \(pajamas, cats, and awkward digital collab-  
oration tools\). Overall, though, we believe that the core of what makes colocation pow-  
erful is the way it fosters shared understanding. It encourages teams to have casual,  
unplanned conversations and makes high-bandwidth multiperson collaborations so  
much easier. So though we’ve learned much about remote working, and though we’ve  
learned to make it work, we believe you lose something when you’re not in a room  
together. So if you’re working remotely, for whatever reason, try to do it in a way that  
limits handoffs, encourages informal collaboration, and seeks out the other subtle ben-  
efits of sitting in the same room with your colleagues.  
Principle\: Self-sufficient and empowered  
What is it? Give your teams all the capabilities they need to operate without  
external dependencies. Ensure that they have the tools they need to create and  
release software. Give them permission to figure out how to solve the problems  
they face and to engage with users and customers through firsthand contact.  
Why do it? Teams without external dependencies are free to optimize their  
process for maximum efficiency. They neither want for outside resources, nor  
do they want for external expertise. Teams that can create and release software  
themselves can move at a rapid pace and can maximize their learning. Finally,  
teams cannot learn from the market if they are not allowed to engage with the  
market. Teams must be able to interact with customers directly in order to get  
the feedback they need to create effective solutions.  
Principle\: Problem-focused  
What is it? A problem-focused team is one that has been given a business or  
user problem to solve as opposed to a set of features to implement. In other  
words, this is a team that has been organized around an outcome.  
Why do it? Assigning teams problems to solve shows trust in those teams. It  
allows them to come up with their own solutions and drives a deeper sense of  
pride and ownership in the solutions the team implements. It also changes  
what “done” looks like—instead of simply shipping a feature, teams that have  
the room to really solve problems will typically have to iterate until the prob-  
lem is really solved.  
12  
LEAN UXPrinciples to Guide Culture  
Culture and process are inextricable. Adopting Lean UX means adopting a cul-  
ture of learning and curiosity. Here are the Lean UX principles that can help  
guide your culture toward that end state\:  
• Moving from doubt to certainty  
• Outcomes, not output  
• Removing waste  
• Shared understanding  
• No rock stars, gurus, or ninjas  
• Permission to fail  
Principle\: Moving from doubt to certainty  
What is it? Software development is complex and unpredictable. Because of  
this, Lean UX begins with the idea that everything is an assumption until we  
prove otherwise. As we work, we gain clarity. Thus, we are always moving  
from a position of doubt to one of certainty.  
Why do it? Every project begins with a set of assumptions. Sometimes, these  
assumptions are easy to spot; sometimes we don’t see them until it’s too late.  
To eliminate the risk of investing a lot of time and effort in work that’s based  
on bad assumptions, we begin by validating our assumptions. We adopt a  
mindset of enthusiastic skepticism. This means that we begin with doubt and  
proceed to validate what we know, as systematically and rigorously as we pos-  
sibly can. In the process, our learning lets us become more certain about our  
positions as we pursue ongoing improvements to our work.  
Principle\: Outcomes over output  
What is it? Features and services are outputs. The goals they are meant to ach-  
ieve are outcomes. In Lean UX, teams are trying above all to create an out-  
come\: a measurable change in human behavior that creates value. Lean UX  
measures progress in terms of explicitly defined outcomes.  
Why do it? When we attempt to predict which features will achieve specific  
outcomes, we are mostly engaging in speculation. Although it’s easier to man-  
age the launch of specific feature sets, we often can’t predict if a feature will be  
effective until it’s in the market. By managing outcomes \(and the progress  
made toward them\), we gain insight into the efficacy of the features we are  
building. If a feature is not performing well, we can make an objective decision  
as to whether it should be kept, changed, or replaced.  
CHAPTER 2\: PRINCIPLES  
13 Principle\: Removing waste  
What is it? One of the core tenets in Lean manufacturing is the removal of  
anything that doesn’t lead to the ultimate goal. In Lean UX, the ultimate goal  
is improved outcomes; hence, anything that doesn’t contribute to that is con-  
sidered waste and should be removed from the team’s process.  
Why do it? Team resources are limited. The more a team can eliminate waste,  
the faster they can move. Teams want to work on the right challenges. They  
want to be effective. Thinking in terms of value creation and waste removal  
can help teams keep their laser focus where it belongs. Thinking about waste—  
and specifically removing waste—allows us to think critically about our design  
process. It encourages us to think about continuous improvement in the way  
that we work. But it’s not just about the process. What’s the ultimate waste?  
Making stuff that people don’t want. Don’t do that. Focus on the user and use  
your energy to deliver things that are valuable.  
Principle\: Shared understanding  
What is it? Shared understanding is the collective knowledge that builds up  
over time as the team works together. It’s a rich understanding of the space, the  
product, and the customers.  
Why do it? Shared understanding is the currency of Lean UX. The more a team  
collectively understands what they’re doing and why, the less they need to  
debate what happened and can quickly move to how to solve for the new  
learning. In addition, it reduces the team’s dependencies on secondhand reports  
and detailed documents to continue its work. The more you can create a  
shared understanding of what users need, the more you are able to cut through  
ego, power plays, and self-referential design decisions.  
Principle\: No rock stars, gurus, or ninjas  
What is it? Lean UX advocates a team-based mentality. Rock stars, gurus, nin-  
jas—we use these labels to describe individual stars. Rather than focus on star  
performers, Lean UX seeks team cohesion and collaboration.  
Why do it? Rock stars don’t share—neither their ideas nor the spotlight. Team  
cohesion breaks down when you add individuals with large egos who are  
determined to stand out and be stars. When collaboration breaks down, you  
lose the environment you need to create the shared understanding required to  
move forward effectively.  
14  
LEAN UX Principle\: Permission to fail  
What is it? To find the best solution to business problems, Lean UX teams need  
to experiment with ideas. Most of these ideas will fail. Permission to fail means  
that the team has a safe environment in which to experiment. That applies to  
both the technical environment \(they can push out ideas in a technically safe  
way\) and the cultural environment \(they won’t be penalized for trying ideas  
that don’t succeed\).  
Why do it? Permission to fail is the platform on which you build a culture of  
experimentation. Experimentation breeds creativity. Creativity, in turn, yields  
innovative solutions. When teams don’t fear for their jobs if they get something  
wrong, they’re more apt to take risks. It is from those risks that big ideas ulti-  
mately come.  
The Virtues of Continuous Improvement  
In a video called “Why You Need to Fail,” CD Baby founder Derek Sivers describes the  
surprising results of a ceramics class.4  
On the first day, the instructor announced to his class that the students would be divi-  
ded into two groups. Half of the students would only need to make one clay pot each  
during the semester. Their grades would depend on the perfection of that solitary pot.  
The other half of the class would be graded simply by the weight of the pots they  
made during the semester. If they made 50 pounds of pots or more, they’d get an A.  
Forty pounds would earn a B; 30 pounds, a C; and so on. What they actually made was  
irrelevant. The instructor said he wouldn’t even look at their pots. He would simply  
bring his bathroom scale to the final day of class and weigh the students’ work.  
At the end of the semester, an interesting thing had occurred. Outside observers of the  
class noted that the highest-quality pots had been made by the “quantity group.” They  
had spent the entire semester working as quickly as they could to make pots. Some-  
times they succeeded, and sometimes they failed. With each iteration, each experi-  
ment, they learned. From that learning, they became better able to achieve the end  
goal\: making high-quality clay pots.  
By contrast, the group that made one object didn’t have the benefit of those failed iter-  
ations and didn’t learn quickly enough to perform at the same level as the “quantity  
group.” They had spent their semester theorizing about what would make a “grade-A”  
clay pot but didn’t have the experience to execute that grandiose vision.

CHAPTER 2\: PRINCIPLES  
15Principles to Guide Process  
Now that we have a sense of the broader organizational and cultural princi-  
ples, let’s take a tactical look at how teams need to change the way they’re  
working\:  
• Don’t do the same thing faster.  
• Beware of phases.  
• Iteration is the key to agility.  
• Work in small batches to mitigate risk.  
• Embrace continuous discovery.  
• Get out of the building.  
• Externalize your work.  
• Make over analysis.  
• Get out of the deliverables business.  
Principle\: don’t do the same thing faster  
What is it? When teams adopt Agile, the first attempts often involve doing the  
same things they’ve always done, just faster. This never works out well. You  
can’t do eight weeks of research in two weeks. Don’t even try. Instead, you  
need to behave in a new way. You need to reconceptualize the work.  
Why do it? The goal of Agile isn’t to work fast. It’s not to work in two-week  
sprints. The goal isn’t to follow all the rules. The goal is to work in a way  
that’s appropriate to the medium of software and, in doing so, to make better  
products and services that deliver more value. So Agile methods give us an  
opportunity to rethink the way we work, the way we collaborate, the way we  
deliver value. Sometimes, we can simply fit old processes into Agile rhythms.  
Sometimes, we can’t. When that happens, don’t force the methods—rethink  
them!  
Principle\: beware of phases  
What is it? Any time you have a research phase, a design phase, a development  
phase, a testing phase, a \(God forbid\) hardening phase, really, an anything-  
phase, it should serve as a warning sign that something’s wrong. Agile teams  
should be doing all of these things continuously, in every sprint. You should be  
researching continuously. Designing continuously. Building continuously. Test-  
ing.…You get the point.  
16  
LEAN UX Why do we do it? Agile work is based on a fundamental idea\: inspect and  
adapt. You want to have finished work that you can inspect on a frequent,  
regular basis. Phases—whether they’re research phases, design phases, build  
phases, whatever—don’t result in finished work. They result in finished process  
steps. To get to finished work, you need to move from phased work to continu-  
ous work.  
Principle\: iteration is the key to agility  
What is it? When you’re breaking work into small batches, don’t settle for  
incremental slices. Instead, take an iterative approach. Expect to design and  
test your work—often the same work—multiple times until you get it right.  
Why do it? Many Agile teams mix up incremental approaches \(slicing a big  
feature into small parts and delivering it over several sprints\) with iterative  
approaches \(working on a feature over and over in order to improve it\). In  
part, this is because we value working in small batches, and both approaches  
are indeed small-batch approaches. Iteration, though, is a commitment to  
redoing your work until you get it right, until it solves the problem you’re try-  
ing to solve, until it meets user needs \(not simply meets the functional spec\),  
until it delivers the outcome that you’re trying to create. Iteration is also the  
key to ending one of the most common frustrations that UX designers experi-  
ence in the Agile world\: the feeling that we never get enough time to get it  
right. By working on a feature until it’s right, teams have a chance to deliver  
great work that they are proud of, that satisfies the user, and that solves the  
problem the business sets out to solve.  
Principle\: work in small batches to mitigate risk  
What is it? Another fundamental from Lean manufacturing is the practice of  
dividing work into small units or batches. Lean manufacturing uses this notion  
to keep inventory low and quality high. Translated to Lean UX, this means  
creating only the design that is necessary to move the team forward and avoid-  
ing a big “inventory” of untested and unimplemented design ideas.  
Why do it? Every project begins with assumptions. Large-batch design begins  
with those untested assumptions and creates a lot of design work on top of  
them. This means that if we find out that a foundational assumption is wrong,  
we must throw away a lot of work. By working in smaller batches, we can  
design and validate our decisions as we go, which reduces the risk of wasted  
work.  
CHAPTER 2\: PRINCIPLES  
17 Principle\: embrace continuous discovery  
What is it? Continuous discovery is the ongoing process of engaging the cus-  
tomer during the design and development process. This is done through regu-  
larly scheduled activities, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The  
goal is to understand both what the user is doing with your products and why  
they are doing it. So you do research on a frequent basis and a regular rhythm.  
Research involves the entire team.  
Why do it? Regular customer conversations provide frequent opportunities for  
validating new product ideas. Bringing the entire team into the research cycle  
develops empathy for users and the problems they face. You create shared  
understanding. Finally, as the team learns together, you reduce the need for  
future debrief conversations and documentation.  
Principle\: get out of the building  
What is it? This phrase, made popular by Steve Blank, Stanford professor,  
entrepreneur, and author, refers to the practice of what UX people know sim-  
ply as “user research.” In the Lean manufacturing world, you’ll hear a similar  
idea expressed as “go and see.”  
What all of these communities have codiscovered is the idea that you won’t  
find the truth about your users in a conference room. You have to go to where  
they are, observe what they’re doing, and actually engage with them in order  
to understand what they’re doing, what they’re trying to do, and why they’re  
trying to do it.  
Lean UX aligns with this prescription\: give potential customers a chance to  
provide feedback on your ideas sooner than you would have in the past. Much  
sooner. Test your ideas with a strong dose of reality while they’re still young.  
Better to find out that your ideas are missing the mark before you’ve spent  
time and resources building a product that no one wants.  
Why do it? Ultimately, the success or failure of your product isn’t the team’s  
decision—it’s the customer’s. They will need to click that “Buy Now” button  
you designed. The sooner you give them a voice, the sooner you’ll learn  
whether you’ve got an idea that works.  
Principle\: externalize your work  
What is it? Externalizing means getting your work out of your head and out of  
your computer and into public view. Teams use whiteboards, virtual shared  
spaces, foam-core boards, artifact walls, printouts, and sticky notes to expose  
their work in progress to their teammates, colleagues, and customers.  
18  
LEAN UX Why do it? Externalizing work allows everyone to see where the team stands.  
It creates a passive, ambient flow of information across the team. It inspires  
new ideas that build off the ones that have already been shared. It allows all  
the members of the team—even the quiet ones—to participate in information-  
sharing activities. Their sticky notes or whiteboard sketches are equally as loud  
as the most prominent person on the team.  
Principle\: make over analysis  
What is it? Lean UX values making over analysis. There is more value in creat-  
ing the first version of an idea than spending half a day debating its merits in a  
conference room.  
Why do it? The answer to most difficult questions the team will face will not  
be answered in a conference room; it’s the customers in the field who will  
answer them. To get those answers, you need to make the ideas concrete—you  
need to make something for people to respond to. Debating ideas without  
market-based data is waste. Instead of analyzing potential scenarios, make  
something and get out of the building with it.  
Principle\: get out of the deliverables business  
What is it? Lean UX shifts the focus of the design process away from the docu-  
ments the team is creating. Instead, it focuses on the outcomes the team is ach-  
ieving. With increased cross-functional collaboration, stakeholder conversation  
becomes less about what artifact is being created and more about which out-  
come is being achieved.  
Why do it? Documents don’t solve customer problems—good products do.  
The team’s focus should be on learning which features have the biggest impact  
on its customers. The artifacts the team uses to gain and communicate that  
knowledge are irrelevant. All that matters is the quality of the product, as  
measured by the market’s reaction to it.  
# Wrapping Up  
This chapter put forward a set of foundational principles for Lean UX. These  
are the core attributes that any Lean UX team should strive to embody. As you  
begin to form your practice, we encourage you to use these principles to define  
your team’s makeup, location, goals, and practices.  
CHAPTER 2\: PRINCIPLES  
19 C H A P T E R 3  
# Outcomes  
Traditionally, software projects are framed by requirements and deliverables.  
Teams are given requirements and are expected to create deliverables. These  
deliverables will describe systems, features, and technology that will satisfy  
those requirements. In many cases, requirements arrive without strategic con-  
text. Why are we doing this? For whom? What does success look like?  
Lean UX radically shifts the way we frame our work by introducing back the  
strategic context for our feature and design choices and, more important, how  
we—the entire team, not just the design department—define success. Our goal  
is not to create a deliverable or a feature\: it’s to positively affect customer  
behavior or change in the world—to create an outcome.  
# What Business Are We In?  
Lean UX means getting out of the deliverables business. We’re in the business  
of creating outcomes. We must focus less on the stuff we make—the documen-  
tation and mock-ups and prototypes, the features and pages and buttons—and  
more on generating results. To do that, we focus on only making things that  
generate the outcomes that we want.  
Why focus on outcomes instead of features and deliverables? It’s because we’ve  
learned that it’s hard—and in many cases impossible—to predict whether the  
features we design and build will create the value we want to create. Will this  
button encourage people to purchase? Will this feature create more engage-  
ment? Will people use this feature in ways we didn’t predict? Will we success-  
fully shift the way people interact with our service? So, rather than focus on  
the features, it’s better to focus on the value we’re trying to create and keep  
21 testing solutions until we find one that delivers the value—the outcome—that  
we desire.  
This shift in emphasis applies both to the things that designers make as part of  
their process—documents, mock-ups, wireframes, specifications, prototypes—  
and to the way we frame our work. What is the result that our clients or stake-  
holders want? Sure, they may be asking us to create a website or an app. They  
may be asking for a new page, a new flow, some new copy. But they’re asking  
that for a reason—and part of our job is to understand and articulate that rea-  
son. We’ll dig into how to do that in the next part of the book. For now,  
though, we want to equip you with a little bit of language to help you reframe  
your work away from deliverables and toward results—in other words, to  
move from outputs to outcomes.  
A Story About Outcomes  
Imagine a small team working at an agency. Jono, Nicole, Alex, and Amanda  
are meeting with a new client for the first time. The client has hired the agency  
to design, build, and launch a new website that they are committed to launch-  
ing later in the year.  
The client team has prepared for this first meeting. They’ve prepared and sent  
a detailed list of requirements that the website must meet. The feature list is  
ambitious and, for the agency team, more than a little scary. The agency team  
has done their homework too. They’ve reviewed the requirements list, and they  
have a set of questions ready for the client.  
After some introductions and pleasantries, Nicole cuts to the chase. She says,  
“So we’ve had a chance to review the requirements list, and there’s a lot here.  
One thing that would help us would be to step away from the requirements for  
a moment and just talk about the purpose of the site and service. Can you tell  
us why this service is important for your business?”  
“Sure,” says Cecily, the CEO of the small company that has hired the agency.  
“We currently operate a very high-end adventure-travel and event-planning  
service for perhaps 50 clients a year. It’s a very high-touch service. We’d like to  
launch an online version of our service so that we can serve thousands of cli-  
ents each year. We know the demand is there, but the economics require a  
lower-touch approach, and that’s what this website will provide.”  
“That’s great,” says Nicole. Jono goes to the whiteboard and writes Impact\: a  
successful low-touch service that allows us to serve thousands of clients each  
year.  
Nicole continues\: “And when this service is live, what will customers be able to  
do that they can’t do today?”  
22  
LEAN UX “Well,” says Cecily, pausing for a moment. “That’s a good question. Our cur-  
rent service is a specialized event-planning service for bespoke events in exotic  
locations. We do all of the planning ourselves. In our new service, we’d like  
event hosts who don’t require our travel expertise to be able to find event plan-  
ners to work with that fit their budgets and their needs.”  
“Awesome,” says Jono, who writes on the board Outcome\: event hosts will  
meet qualified event planners for domestic and local events.  
Cecily looks at the board, a bit puzzled. She says, “That’s all obvious stuff.  
Why does this help you?”  
Nicole explains, “Well, the feature list in your requirements document is very  
ambitious.” This is Nicole’s polite way of explaining that the list is unreasona-  
bly long and veers frequently into speculation. She continues\: “Since your  
deadline is pretty short, we’re going to need to filter the list and decide what to  
build first and what features can wait until later. Understanding the outcome  
our users want will help us prioritize the feature list so that we can focus on  
things that help customers meet each other, find projects, and bid on them  
together. Anything that doesn’t create that outcome will get deprioritized.”  
Unpacking the Story\: Output, Outcomes, Impact  
Now, the story above is fiction, but it’s based on countless real kickoff meet-  
ings, and it illustrates one of the key ideas in Lean UX\: Lean UX is about  
focusing on outcomes.  
Let’s look at the story in a little more detail and talk a bit about the framework  
behind Nicole and Jono’s process.  
First, the client arrived with a long list of requirements—these requirements  
described the website and the features of the site that they wanted the agency  
to design and build. These are the things that they wanted the agency to make\:  
the output.  
The agency team knew that the list of features was too long—it would take a  
long time to build everything in the requirements document—and, worse, they  
suspected that many of the features in that list wouldn’t be useful to end users  
or to the client. So the agency team was looking to get beyond the feature list.  
When Nicole asked about the impact that the client was seeking, she was going  
to the big picture. If the CEO wanted to keep her job, what would she need to  
deliver to the board? We use the word “impact” to describe the highest-level  
targets that a business sets. These tend to be things like revenue, profit, cus-  
tomer loyalty. But they can also be big, strategic objectives, like Cecily’s goal to  
grow from a boutique provider of services into an organization with broader  
reach.  
CHAPTER 3\: OUTCOMES  
23 The problem with big targets—impact-level targets—is that there are so many  
ways to pursue them, and so many factors that contribute to them, that it can  
be difficult to know how to break down the work and how to measure pro-  
gress toward that target. To address that, we use an intermediate target, called  
an “outcome.” In this case, the team captured the most important intermediate  
target they would be working toward, which was the outcome\: To allow quali-  
fied professionals to meet one another and create collaborative project bids.  
So, while outputs are things we make, like websites and features, outcomes are  
things that people do. In fact, that’s the key to our definition of outcomes. We  
define an outcome as “a change in human behavior that creates value.”1 When  
we use this definition of outcome, we are using an inherently human-centered  
idea to define success. When we move away from outputs—the stuff we make  
—and toward outcomes, we’re choosing to put humans and their needs at the  
center of what we do.  
The Logic Model  
We’ve drawn our language \(outputs, outcomes, impact\) from a model called the logic  
model, first described in 2004 by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. This model has proven  
popular in the nonprofit world. The goal of the model was to help people running  
complex projects evaluate the efficacy of those programs. When granters give money  
for a program, they typically have an impact in mind. How can they evaluate whether  
their grant money is being well spent? The logic model framework was developed to  
help program evaluators answer this question. The model is usually visualized as  
shown in Figure 3-1.  
Figure 3-1. The logic model  
In our work with teams, we’ve discovered that this model can be really useful to Agile  
teams. We’ve adapted it a bit for our more limited context. But if you’re interested in  
learning more, we encourage you to go to the source and read more about program  
evaluation at the Kellogg Foundation site.

LEAN UX A deeper look at an outcome  
Let’s take a closer look at the outcome in our story. First, we said that an out-  
come is a change in behavior. What do we mean by that? In our story, our out-  
come was\: meet qualified professionals and create collaborative project bids.  
This project—if it’s successful—will encourage a behavior\: professionals will  
meet one another online in order to create project bids together. This might be  
a new behavior—something that these professionals can’t do today—or it  
might simply be a better way to do something that they do today. Either way,  
we consider that a behavior change.  
And what about the creates value part of our definition? Well, if our work is  
successful, these professionals will be able to do this new thing, and they’ll get  
value from being able to do it. So, then, we’ve satisfied both parts of our defi-  
nition. Professionals will be able to do this new thing, and they’ll get value  
from doing it.  
Now, what’s interesting here is that this new behavior also creates value for the  
organization. They benefit from this new customer behavior, because when  
they satisfy their customer, the customer pays them for the service, is more  
likely to pay them again in the future, and is also more likely to recommend  
the service to others. If you’re reading closely, you’ll notice that these are also  
customer behaviors—customers pay for service, they return for more service,  
they recommend the service. All of these are outcomes, too, but these out-  
comes don’t necessarily benefit the user. Instead, these outcomes benefit the  
organization.  
That’s an important thing to pay attention to when we work with outcomes\:  
who is getting value from the behavior in question? When a professional can  
do business more easily, they are getting that value. When the customer pays  
for this outcome, the organization is getting the value. In other words, value  
depends on your point of view. We’ll talk about this in more detail in Chap-  
ter 8. For now, just remember that every outcome comes with a point of view  
baked in, and it’s important to understand whose point of view we’re thinking  
about. \(See Figure 3-2.\)  
Let’s look at a system like Facebook for an example of point of view. When an  
end user logs on to Facebook, they get value from reading and posting to the  
timeline. Advertisers get value when timeline users see and interact with ads.  
And Facebook gets value when users spend more time on the site and advertis-  
ers pay them for access to these people. If you want your system to work, you  
need to create a set of aligned outcomes—you need to understand the ways  
that different users get value and then deliver that value to them in a way that  
also creates value for your organization.  
CHAPTER 3\: OUTCOMES  
25 Figure 3-2. Aligned value  
The Facebook example brings up another point of view here, which relates to  
the value the system creates for people who don’t directly use the system. Face-  
book’s impact on society is—well, let’s call it controversial. In terms of our  
model, they have created a way to deliver value to users, advertisers, and them-  
selves, but at what cost to society? A robust and ethical framework for align-  
ing value has to take into account the needs of a broad range of stakeholders—  
both those who directly interact with the system and those who are indirectly  
impacted.2  
This brings us to a final point here\: none of the systems that we work on can  
be described with a single outcome statement. They are all systems of interrela-  
ted outcomes. What’s more, all of these related outcomes combine to create the  
high-level impact \(or impacts\) that we seek. This can make working with out-

Empowerment and Exploitation in UX,” Culture Clash, February 4, 2021, https\://oreil.ly/

LEAN UX comes tricky—a typical system is composed of many people performing many  
behaviors. It’s easy to quickly get overwhelmed. What behaviors are impor-  
tant? Which ones should we focus on? In coming chapters, we’ll share some  
techniques for discovering, understanding, and mapping these related out-  
comes and for navigating through this complexity to find the key outcomes to  
focus on.  
# Outcomes, Iteration, and Validation  
When you shift the focus of your work from outputs to outcomes, it creates  
huge changes in the way you organize your work. One of the big things that  
changes is the finish line\: how do you know when you’re done?  
In the software world, we typically use requirements, specifications, and  
acceptance criteria to tell us when work is done. Is the software running? Does  
it meet the specs? Comply with requirements? Meet the acceptance criteria?  
Does it meet what Scrum calls the “definition of done”? These methods are  
good in that they can define the finish line very precisely, but they almost  
always ask us to evaluate the output of our work. What if we don’t want to  
stop there? What if we want to measure the outcomes that we’ve created?  
It turns out that, in this case, we can’t stop working on a thing when we’ve  
finished making it. To measure outcomes, we actually need to put that thing in  
the world and observe how \(or if\) it changes people’s behaviors. In other  
words, while we have to complete the output, that’s not enough. We have to  
validate it.  
The process of validating our output is inherently iterative. Most of the time,  
teams don’t get everything right on their first attempt. Typically, our first  
attempt may get some of the outcome we seek but usually not all of it. When  
we focus on outcomes, we see the opportunity for improvement, and we keep  
working on that thing until it delivers the outcomes that we set out to deliver.  
This is the process that Lean Startup calls the build-measure-learn loop and  
what the Agile community calls inspect and adapt. Whatever you call these  
loops, they describe an iterative approach. An approach that means the end of  
one-and-done. An approach that means we iterate until we achieve the  
outcome.  
CHAPTER 3\: OUTCOMES  
27 PART II  
# PROCESS  
# About Part II  
In the previous part, we looked at the ideas behind Lean UX—the principles  
that drive the work. In this section, we’ll get very practical and describe in  
detail the process of doing Lean UX.  
We’ve organized this section around a new tool that we’ve been using for the  
last few years\: the Lean UX Canvas. The Lean UX Canvas is a way to orches-  
trate your Lean UX process. It offers a single-page “at-a-glance” way of fram-  
ing your work on a feature, an epic or initiative, or even an entire product.  
This single-page tool collects all of the key tools, methods, processes, and tech-  
niques of Lean UX into a single document with a unified structure. It’s a tool  
that you can use to get from the earliest part of the design process—your initial  
problem framing—through design, prototyping, and research.  
Although you don’t have to use the canvas to do Lean UX, we’ve found that  
the canvas is a great way to explain the process, so we’ve chosen to present the  
Lean UX process to you by using the canvas.  
29 The Lean UX Canvas  
Chapter 4, The Lean UX Canvas, provides an overview of the Lean UX Can-  
vas. You’ll learn why Lean UX is skeptical of requirements, why it embraces  
assumptions instead, and how the Lean UX Canvas is a vehicle that you can  
use to capture and test your assumptions. This chapter also introduces some  
ideas about facilitating the process of working with the canvas.  
Chapter 5, Box 1\: Business Problem, covers the technique you’ll use to define  
the problem you and your team are trying to solve from the business’s POV.  
Chapter 6, Box 2\: Business Outcomes, covers how you define success for your  
project. This box is all about understanding what outcomes you’re trying to  
achieve for your business, organization, or clients.  
Chapter 7, Box 3\: Users, covers the section of the canvas that defines your  
users \(and customers\). This section describes the proto-persona technique and  
how to use it.  
Chapter 8, Box 4\: User Outcomes and Benefits, is all about user goals. What  
are your users \(and customers\) trying to do? What will define success for  
them?  
Chapter 9, Box 5\: Solutions, is where we begin to define what we’ll be making  
\(or doing\) in order to solve the problems we’ve defined.  
Chapter 10, Box 6\: Hypotheses, Chapter 11, Box 7\: What’s the Most Impor-  
tant Thing We Need to Learn First?, and Chapter 12, Box 8\: MVPs and  
Experiments, cover the bottom third of the canvas, which drives the conversa-  
tion to find out if we’re right about everything else in the canvas.  
Let’s dig into each box and see exactly how each part of this conversation  
plays out, how to facilitate it successfully, and what to watch out for in each  
box as you go through the exercises and declare your assumptions.

# The Lean UX Canvas  
# Assumptions Are the New Requirements  
If you work in an industry where things are relatively predictable, where there  
is low risk and high certainty in what the company is making, what it takes to  
make your product, what it looks like when it’s done, and what your custom-  
ers will do with it once they have it, you can comfortably work with a set of  
rigid, predetermined requirements. In a world with this manufacturing-era  
mentality, big design up front is the norm, and any variability in the produc-  
tion of your product is seen not as an agile response to a changing marketplace  
but rather as an expensive deviation from the plan. This way of thinking about  
requirements was adopted in the early days of the software industry, was the  
dominant model for decades, and continues to permeate many teams’ ways of  
working even to this day.  
Requirements assume we know exactly what we need to build. Ideally, they  
come from engineering rigor. But in software, they usually don’t have the rigor  
behind them. Still, they are taken at face value based on their author’s credibil-  
ity or organizational title. In many cases, that blind faith is augmented with the  
phrase “well, it worked before.” Individuals or teams who question the abso-  
luteness of the requirements they’ve received are perceived as troublemakers  
and treated as scapegoats when projects end up missing deadlines, exceeding  
scope, or both. In organizations still leaning heavily on them as a way to tell  
teams what to do, requirements often simply mean, as our friend Jeff Patton  
likes to say, “Shut up.”  
But today’s software-based businesses operate in a reality devoid of consis-  
tency, predictability, stability, and certainty. Saying with authority that a spe-  
cific combination of code, copy, and design will achieve a desired business  
31 outcome and will be delivered completely by an explicit deadline is not just  
risky; in most cases it’s a lie. Software development is complex and unpredicta-  
ble. The pace of change is incredibly fast. Not only can companies ship fea-  
tures to production continuously at unprecedented speeds, but consumer  
behaviors are changing just as quickly. As soon as you’ve settled on a feature  
set, design approach, and specific user experience, your audience begins to  
evolve into new mental models based on their experiences with other online  
services.  
The good news is that we don’t have to rely on requirements. The industry has  
developed new ways to work that allow us to move away from rigid require-  
ments. When we wrote the first edition of this book, Amazon was shipping  
code to production every 11.6 seconds. Today they’ve decreased their time to  
market to one second.1 That’s right\: every second some Amazon customer  
somewhere in their ecosystem experiences a change to the way the product  
works. Sixty times per minute, Amazon has an opportunity to learn how well  
they’re meeting the needs of their customers. Sixty times per minute, they have  
an opportunity to respond to what they’re learning. Sixty times per minute,  
they have an opportunity to make their user experience better. With this capa-  
bility, the very idea of a rigid requirement is, at best, anachronistic. At worst,  
it’s an impediment that prevents teams from doing their best work. We’ll grant  
that Amazon is at the extreme end of this, but they serve as inspiration and a  
clear target for what is possible. If we can ship, sense, and respond to this  
quickly, then assuming that we know exactly how to best deliver value is a  
level of arrogance and risk your organization cannot afford.  
There are other reasons to avoid requirements. Software is hard. Even seas-  
oned software engineers will tell you that just because something seems simple  
to build doesn’t mean it actually will be simple to build. Oftentimes, as we set  
out to deliver a specific user experience, we learn that in order to do so we’ll  
need to develop more code than we anticipated. The code we thought would  
be simple turns out to have complex dependencies or has legacy constraints or  
runs into unplanned obstacles, and we end up having to spend extra time figur-  
ing out how to work around these problems. This, too, flies in the face of rigid,  
deadline-based requirements.  
And, of course, it’s not just code that is complex and unpredictable. Humans  
are complex and unpredictable too. Their innate motivations, personalities,  
expectations, cultural norms, and habits all fly in the face of what we believe  
will be an ideal software service for them to use. We put so much faith in what  
we think will be “easy to use” or “intuitive,” only to find that our target

LEAN UX audience goes out of their way to avoid the simplifications we believe we made  
for them. Why do they do this? Any variety of factors \(which we could learn  
about through customer interviews and research\) could lead to these unexpec-  
ted behaviors, but they all have the same net result\: they prove our require-  
ments wrong.  
So what should we do? We need to recognize that most requirements are sim-  
ply assumptions expressed with authority. If we remove the authority, overcon-  
fidence, and arrogance from the conversation, we’re left with someone’s best  
guess about how to best achieve a user goal or solve a business problem. We  
are makers of digital products, so humbly admitting that these are indeed our  
best guesses or assumptions immediately and explicitly creates the space for  
product discovery and Lean UX to take place. If we understand as a team that  
the work we’re undertaking is risky exactly because we can’t predict human  
behavior, we know that part of our work will have to include experimentation,  
research, and rework. We reduce our attachment to the ideas and create a team  
culture that is more willing to adjust course—even to stop working on an idea  
that continues to prove unviable.  
So how do we build a conversation that encourages ideas from the whole team  
but qualifies those ideas as a series of assumptions? In earlier versions of this  
book we shared a series of assumptions declaration exercises. These processes  
have helped readers and practitioners express their ideas in a new way, as test-  
able assumptions. Over the years, we’ve consolidated these assumptions decla-  
ration exercises, as well as the steps you’ll need to test your assumptions, into  
one comprehensive facilitation tool we call the Lean UX Canvas.  
# The Lean UX Canvas  
The Lean UX Canvas \(Figure 4-1\) brings together a series of exercises that  
allow teams to declare their assumptions about an initiative. It’s designed to  
facilitate conversations within the team but also with stakeholders, clients, and  
other colleagues. Remember that in Lean UX we’re trying to build shared  
understanding, and to do that \(especially when we’re trying to move away  
from requirements\), we need a consistent shared vocabulary that allows stake-  
holders and individual contributors alike to share their ideas and create clarity.  
If you’ve done some Lean UX work in the past, you’ll recognize most of these  
activities. If you’ve done design work before, you’ll recognize the importance  
of all of the topics on the canvas and how important it is to have conversations  
about these topics at the start of a project. Our experience using this canvas is  
that the structure of the canvas helps ensure all these conversations take place,  
that the conversations include a diverse set of viewpoints, and that, when  
you’re done, the extended team has built shared understanding and the path  
forward is clear.  
CHAPTER 4\: THE LEAN UX CANVAS  
33 Figure 4-1. The Lean UX Canvas  
34  
LEAN UX The canvas was designed to guide the conversation from the current state of  
your product or system—or what Mike Rother called the current condition  
\(“NOW” in Figure 4-2\) in his book The Toyota Kata2—to its desired future  
state or target condition \(“LATER” in Figure 4-2\).  
Figure 4-2. The key areas of the Lean UX Canvas  
Another Canvas?  
Another canvas? Fair question. Ever since Alex Osterwalder and the team at Strategyzer  
gifted the world the Business Model Canvas, we’ve been enamored and ultimately  
inundated with canvases. If you don’t publish a canvas, are you really even a thought  
leader? Again, fair question. But canvases are useful and can serve as the centerpiece of  
a balanced, inclusive team collaboration. If used correctly, canvases\:  
• Consolidate a series of activities into a sequential process designed to drive a  
narrative.  
• Help in complex environments. They help us create a single visual model to repre-  
sent key elements of that complexity.  
• Serve as an easy-to-follow facilitation tool for teams interested in having a specific  
kind of conversation.

Results \(McGraw-Hill Education, 2009\).  
CHAPTER 4\: THE LEAN UX CANVAS  
35 • Level the playing field for team members less apt to offer their ideas in a standard  
brainstorming session.  
• Create a shared language for the team to use.  
• Successfully frame the job to be done by the team.  
• Communicate the challenge or work the team is undertaking broadly beyond the  
team.  
# Using the Canvas  
In the coming chapters, we’ll describe each section of the canvas in detail.  
Before we do that, however, we want to answer some general questions that  
come up whenever we teach teams about the canvas.  
So When Should We Use the Lean UX Canvas?  
We think that the canvas is a great way to start an initiative. Whether you’re  
working on a new feature, a major initiative, or a new product, the canvas is a  
great structure to use for your kickoff meeting. As you get comfortable with  
the tool, you’ll start to develop a sense of when a piece of work is too small for  
the canvas. Generally, we think it’s a good idea to use it any time you’re plan-  
ning a big chunk of work.  
Is the Lean UX Canvas Best Suited for Early-Stage Ideas or for  
Sustaining Innovation?  
The canvas actually works well for both types of work. The key question is  
this\: are you facing important unknowns, uncertainty, or complexity? That’s  
where the Lean UX Canvas—and, really, Lean UX in general—can help. In  
early-stage work, the unknowns tend to be existential in nature\: is there a need  
for this product or service? Will people use our solution? Can we build a busi-  
ness by solving this problem? In sustaining innovation, the questions tend to be  
smaller, but that doesn’t mean that the answers are any clearer. In both of these  
situations, the Lean UX Canvas can help.  
Who Should Work on the Canvas?  
One of the values of the canvas is the way that working through it creates  
shared understanding on your team. It encourages the team and stakeholders  
to do the product discovery work that makes for successful products. So we  
believe that all team members should participate in the work on the canvas.  
We also think that stakeholders and clients should participate as much as pos-  
sible, especially during the parts of the work to elaborate the business problem  
statement and business goals.  
36  
LEAN UXHow Long Should We Expect to Spend on a Lean UX Canvas?  
It’s hard to get through the whole thing in less than a half-day session. Because  
the canvas makes a great kickoff activity, think about how much time you nor-  
mally spend kicking off projects. Is that a two-day exercise? A full week? Some  
teams will work through the canvas that way, especially if you can all be  
together in the same room. Other teams will choose to hold a series of meet-  
ings over the course of a couple of weeks. In general, the bigger and more  
important the project, the longer it will take. Don’t get stuck in analysis para-  
lysis. When you don’t know something, put it in the parking lot and move on.  
After all, the whole point of the canvas is to collect the things that you don’t  
know so that you can start learning about them quickly.  
Do We Have to Use the Canvas to Do Lean UX?  
Absolutely not. Each part of the canvas contains a useful part of the Lean UX  
process. As you’re working on any initiative, you’re going to want to think  
about and answer the questions implied by each of the boxes on the canvas.  
That said, you can absolutely use each box on the canvas as a standalone tech-  
nique. Are you unclear about your users? Go to Box 3, read about proto-  
personas, and use these ideas with your team to get clarity. Are you unclear  
about the best solution to a problem? Flip to the section of this book on Box 5  
and take your team through that process.  
If you decide to use the canvas as a whole, remember that it’s a flexible tool.  
Use the exercises that work best for you, taking into account your context and  
the ways that work for your team. Expand the number of activities as your  
team grows more comfortable with the nature of this work. Ultimately, we  
want to ensure the customer is front and center in all of your conversations.  
The Lean UX Canvas is a strong starting point for ensuring that happens.  
Facilitating Each Section  
In the chapters to come, we’ll share instructions for exercises that we like to  
use to complete the canvas. Here, we’d like to note some general patterns.  
Be inclusive  
We want the whole team to participate in completing the canvas.3 This means  
that your facilitation needs to account for different participation styles, as well  
as the different levels of power and authority in the room.  
3 The idea of “the whole team” will vary based on your context, so feel free to adapt this advice  
based on the size of your group and the roles of the people in the room.  
CHAPTER 4\: THE LEAN UX CANVAS  
37 To address that, we like to use a variant of the 1-2-4-All pattern.4 This is a  
structured way of eliciting participation from a group. Here’s how it works\:  
• You start by asking people to work individually \(the “1”\), usually silently,  
either by writing ideas or drawing something by themselves. You generally  
want to set an aggressive time limit on this period \(usually five minutes\) to  
force people to get their ideas out and to avoid spending a lot of time edit-  
ing and refining. After this period of solo work, ask folks to share back  
with their table or their subgroup. If people have been working with Post-  
its, it can make sense to ask people to bring them to a wall and post them  
there. Optionally, you can offer discussion during this period. You can also  
ask people to do some affinity mapping at this point.  
• Then, you ask people to work in pairs \(the “2”\) to elaborate or develop an  
idea. Paired work takes more time than solo work, so give the pairs more  
time than you allowed for solo work. Again, following this period of  
paired work, you have the pairs present their work to their table or sub-  
group room, and you may have more discussion at this point.  
• Next, you ask each table or subgroup to develop their work into a single  
presentation. \(This is the “4” portion of the pattern.\)  
• Finally \(if you’re trying to produce one final idea\), you ask the whole  
group to develop a single idea. \(This is the “All” portion of the pattern.\)  
1-2-4-All is effective because it solicits input from everyone in the room, allows  
for both solo and collaborative working styles, and, finally, allows the group  
to come together. You’ll want to adapt this pattern to the specific exercise but  
keep it in mind as you plan group work.  
Remote versus in-person  
All of these exercises can be done as in-person workshops or remotely, with  
videoconferencing software and shared whiteboard tools. If you’re working  
remotely, remember to break up your sessions to allow people to stand up and  
avoid Zoom fatigue. Also, remember that not everyone is familiar with online  
whiteboard tools, so allow some time to bring less experienced participants up  
to speed. \(Sometimes you can use an icebreaker exercise that helps people learn  
the tool.\) We’ve created Lean UX Canvas templates that you can use.

LEAN UX Wrapping Up  
In the coming chapters in this section, we’ll describe each section of the canvas  
in detail.  
CHAPTER 4\: THE LEAN UX CANVAS  
39 C H A P T E R 5  
# Box 1\: Business Problem  
Figure 5-1. Box 1 of the Lean UX Canvas\: Business Problem  
For Lean UX to be successful, teams must be given problems to solve, not solu-  
tions to build. Often, these “solutions” are expressed as requirements or fea-  
ture specifications. But if requirements are the wrong way to go, what’s the  
right way? The right way is to understand and express the problem that stake-  
holders or clients are trying to solve. This is what business problem statements  
do. Business problem statements reframe the work in a way that explicitly  
demands that product discovery work take place.  
41 While there is some flexibility in what a business problem statement can look  
like, at the very least it should\:  
• Provide a specific challenge for the team to solve rather than a set of fea-  
tures to implement.  
• Anchor the team in a customer-centric perspective so that customer success  
is a baked-in part of the end goal.  
• Focus the team’s effort by specifying guidelines and constraints that make  
it clear to the team what is in scope and what is out of scope.  
• Provide clear measures of success expressed as key performance indicators  
of the business \(desired impacts\) or specific outcomes the company wants  
to see in its target audience.  
• Not define a solution \(this is surprisingly harder than it sounds\).  
Foundationally, business problem statements contain three parts\:  
1\. The current goals of the product or the system the team is working on. In  
other words, why was it created in the first place? What problem was it  
originally designed to solve? What value was it intended to deliver?  
2\. What’s changed in the world and how that has negatively affected the  
product? In other words, where are the goals we set for this product not  
being met now?  
3\. An explicit request to improve the product that stays away from specifying  
a solution and that quantifies “improvement” in terms of outcomes.  
When you are creating business problem statements, remember that your ini-  
tial efforts are likely to be filled with assumptions. You’ll discover that this is  
going to be true for every part of the Lean UX Canvas. This is OK; in fact, it’s  
inevitable. Just keep in mind that, as you start to work on the problem—that  
is, as you start to do the discovery work—you may uncover evidence that  
you’re working on the wrong problem or targeting the wrong audience or  
measuring success in the wrong way. That’s fine. That’s why you do discovery!  
Just make sure you bring this learning back to the team and to stakeholders as  
soon as you can so that you ensure you’re not wasting time and effort on an  
invalid problem statement.  
# Facilitating the Exercise  
To create a business problem statement, you can certainly sit down informally  
with stakeholders and product owners to draft one together. That said, we like  
to do this as part of a workshop setting with the whole team. If you’re doing  
that, we recommend using the following process.  
42  
LEAN UX Provide context and background for the team. This often falls on the product  
manager and is critical to framing the work correctly. Questions that the prod-  
uct manager should answer for the team prior to writing a business problem  
statement include\:  
• What have we observed and measured that leads us to believe there’s an  
issue?  
• Who are we targeting with this work?  
• How does this piece of work fit into the broader program of work the  
company is undertaking?  
• What is the impact of fixing \(and not fixing\) this problem on company  
health?  
If you have a large group, divide into pairs or trios and write the first draft of  
the business problem statement in small groups. Small groups can do this  
together. Spend no more than 30 minutes on this first draft.  
Here is the template we use for writing good business problem statements for  
existing products\:  
\[Our service/product\] was designed to achieve \[these business/customer  
goals and deliver this value\]. We have observed \[in these ways\] that the  
product/service isn’t meeting these goals, which is causing \[this adverse  
effect/problem\] to our business.  
How might we improve service/product so that our customers are more suc-  
cessful as determined by \[these measurable changes in their behavior\]?  
If you’re working on brand new initiatives, the template looks like this\:  
The current state of \[the domain we are working in\] has focused mainly on  
\[these customer segments, these pain points, these workflows, etc.\].  
What existing products/services fail to address is \[this gap or change in the  
marketplace\].  
Our product/service will address this gap by \[this product strategy or  
approach\].  
Our initial focus will be \[this audience segment\].  
We’ll know we are successful when we see \[these measurable behaviors in  
our target audience\].  
CHAPTER 5\: BOX 1\: BUSINESS PROBLEM  
43 Once the pairs or trios complete their first draft, come back together as a team  
and read your drafts to each other. Provide critique and feedback, and ask clar-  
ifying questions about each draft. Remember that critique isn’t a direct attack  
on the work but rather a clarifying probe to better understand what the  
authors meant.  
Once everyone has shared their draft, combine into larger groups of four to  
five team members and consolidate into one statement draft. After 30 minutes  
of subgroup consolidation, share back the reworked drafts with the broader  
team. Finally, spend 30 more minutes bringing the drafts together into one  
pan-team business problem statement. Remember that this is an assumptions  
declaration exercise. Inevitably, some of these assumptions will be wrong, so  
the goal of Box 1 isn’t writing the perfect problem statement. The goal is to  
begin to build alignment within the team about where you’re headed on this  
initiative and how you’ll know you’ve achieved the goal.  
NOTE  
Remember that business problem statements are ultimately about the project  
charter, so if stakeholders haven’t been involved, you’ll need to bring them in at  
this point to get their commitment.  
Add your completed problem statement draft to your canvas.  
# Some Examples of Problem Statements  
Here is an example of what a good business problem statement looks like\:  
When we launched our small and medium-sized \(SMB\) digital lending solu-  
tions, the market consisted of antiquated products sold by legacy banking  
institutions. In that world, our digital-first lending solutions stood apart and  
attracted SMB customers searching for new ways to work with their bank.  
With traditional banks functioning increasingly as “fintech” companies, our  
market has become crowded and highly competitive. This is causing our  
customer acquisition costs to go up, market share to stagnate, and customer  
support costs to rise.  
How might we redesign our SMB product line so that our customers believe  
we are purposefully designed to support their modern businesses, in turn  
driving our acquisition costs down and market share up?  
This example is relatively high-level. It is designed to address a problem at the  
business unit level. It is important that the team that works on this problem  
has the jurisdiction and influence to affect work at this level. Writing business  
problem statements that teams cannot actually solve because they lack the  
required level of influence is setting that team up to fail.  
44  
LEAN UX Here is an example of a more tactical business problem statement that can be  
assigned to a feature-level team\:  
The password retrieval functionality was implemented to help customers  
quickly get back into the product in the event of a lost or expired password.  
In addition, this added self-service would reduce the numbers of calls to the  
customer service center, reducing our overall annual support calls since  
password reset calls make up at least 35% of inbound calls.  
We’ve noticed through analytics reports and consistent usability study feed-  
back that our customers struggle to find the password retrieval function  
and, even when they do, fail to complete the reset process on their own at  
least 42% of the time due to its complexity. This is causing an increase in  
call center support costs by 12% while exacerbating customer dissatisfac-  
tion with our product, potentially leading to a 0.7% increase in churn rate.  
How might we redesign the password retrieval experience so that our users  
are more successful as determined by 90% process completion rates and  
50% reduction in calls to customer support about password reset?  
# What to Watch Out For  
Don’t specify the solution. the exercise being called a business problem state-  
ment, we often see teams inserting solutions into the statement. This often  
shows up in the “how might we” part of the statement with phrases such as  
“How might we implement a mobile app that solves for this…” Solutions  
should not be in this exercise at all. We reserve that conversation for Box 5.  
Get the level right. We mentioned “leveling” the problem statement correctly  
earlier, but it’s worth repeating that whether you are writing your own prob-  
lem statements together as a team or someone is writing them for you, your  
team should only sign up for a problem statement they are capable of solving.  
If the problem is framed at too high a level, the team will not be able to solve  
the problem on its own. This will lead to frustration—not only with and  
within the team but with the overall Lean UX process itself.  
Be specific. Another common antipattern is a lack of specificity in the state-  
ment. On occasion, teams will leave explicit metrics or evidence out of the  
problem statement. Specifics are important for framing the importance of the  
problem as well as setting clear, business-level success criteria for the team.  
When in doubt, always push for specificity in the statement.  
Finally, specificity is important not just to the metrics but for the product area  
being addressed. Teams will use phrases like “intuitive UI” or “great user expe-  
rience” to describe work that was done or that is expected to be done. In all  
cases, phrases like these describe features \(albeit in the abstract\) that in general  
should be left out of problem statements.  
CHAPTER 5\: BOX 1\: BUSINESS PROBLEM  
45 Here are two examples of phrases like these in business problem statements  
and how to correct them\:  
When we set out to improve our shopping experience, we implemented an  
intuitive UI for increasing average order value.  
In this example, it’s not clear what was implemented, so therefore the team  
doesn’t really know what portions of the UI to potentially target for  
improvement.  
In this next example, the ambiguous phrase ends up in the “how might we”  
portion that seems benign enough but already focuses the team on a specific  
solution before any discovery work has been done\:  
How might we create a more intuitive UI so that customers add more items  
to their shopping cart during every visit?  
You can see here that the framing of the work tells the team to only go after UI  
enhancements rather than looking for the root cause of dwindling average  
order values.  
NOTE  
And for what it’s worth, everyone sets out to ship intuitive UIs. No one ever says,  
“We’re going to ship a crappy user interface for the ecommerce platform.”

# Box 2\: Business Outcomes  
Figure 6-1. Box 2 of the Lean UX Canvas\: Business Outcomes  
We covered the concept of outcomes in Chapter 3. Box 2 is where they make  
their first appearance on the Lean UX Canvas. Once you’ve got a business  
problem statement, you want to dig deeper into the core behavior changes  
you’re seeking as part of the initiative. Typically, the success criteria in a prob-  
lem statement are high-level. Success criteria there tend to be key performance  
indicators or impact metrics—the things that are found on executive dash-  
boards. These could be metrics like revenue, profit, cost of goods sold, and  
customer satisfaction. These are helpful at measuring the health of the busi-  
ness, but feature-level teams need to work at a lower level.  
47 In this exercise we work together to uncover the leading indicators of those  
impact metrics. The question we’re trying to answer is what will people be  
doing differently if our solutions work? If we choose the right combination of  
code, copy, and design, what do we expect to happen? The answers to these  
questions are what we’re looking for in this assumption declaration exercise.  
Every option in this brainstorm should start with a verb, and each answer  
should be something valuable that customers do in the system already, some-  
thing that’s not valuable that we’d like them to do less of, or something new  
that we think will be valuable and that we’d like them to start doing. In  
essence, we’re thinking through and highlighting user journeys.  
# Using the User Journey  
The goal of this exercise is to find the valuable customer behaviors that we  
want to focus on. In order to do that, it’s helpful to start with a model of cus-  
tomer behavior—what are people doing today? What are they trying to do  
that’s difficult? What are they doing today that’s not productive for them or for  
us? What new, valuable behaviors can we unlock? To answer this question, we  
can use the idea of user journeys.  
User journey mapping can be very simple. We can use a template, like Pirate  
Metrics or Metrics Mountain \(both described below\). Or we can use tools that  
we borrow from Service Design to create a user journey map. Regardless of the  
framework we choose, the idea is to gather the team and stakeholders around  
the map and generate a shared understanding of the journey of how people  
move through our system and which parts of that journey should be the focus  
of our work.  
Depending on your circumstances, here are some models to get you started.  
User Journey Type\: Pirate Metrics  
One way of coming up with your outcome metrics is using Pirate Metrics.  
Conceived at startup incubator 500 Startups, the Pirate Metrics funnel has  
become a standard way to think about the user journey through our products.  
We can use it here to help us determine which portions of that journey are rele-  
vant to the problem we’re addressing.  
Pirate Metrics are made up of five types of customer behaviors\:  
Acquisition  
These are the activities that get customers to the product in the first place.  
Viable options here include number of downloads, visits to the registration  
page, number of sign-ups, etc.  
48  
LEAN UX Activation  
Once a customer has been acquired, we can start to measure whether or  
not they are actually using the product. Activation metrics include things  
like number of accounts created, number of people followed, percentage of  
new sign-ups that made a purchase, etc. These metrics should reflect the  
core functionality of the product.  
Retention  
If we can get customers to try the product, the next challenge is to get  
them to continue using it on a regular basis. “Regular basis” in this case  
will be contextual to your product. \(For a product like Netflix, you would  
measure daily viewing habits, but if you make a smart “learning” thermo-  
stat, you’d likely measure how few interactions the user had with the  
device.\) If we’re retaining customers, generally speaking, they’re coming  
back frequently to use the product, they’re doing more in the product, and  
they’re spending time too.  
Revenue  
If we got them to the product, convinced them to try it, and now they’re  
using it regularly, are they paying us? That’s the next level of commitment  
we look for in our customers. Our goal is to see where and how we’re con-  
verting customers into paid users and how those patterns evolve over time.  
Metrics to consider here include percentage of paid versus free users, aver-  
age lifetime value of each customer, etc.  
Referral  
The final step in the Pirate Metrics funnel is assessing whether our custom-  
ers are referring others to the product. If they truly love it, feel like they’re  
getting value from it, and can’t live without it, they’ll tell their friends or  
the internet through reviews. This is the best kind of marketing you can  
get. Metrics to track here include percentage of new users who came  
through referral, percentage of current users who refer others, and cost of  
acquisition per new user.  
At this point you’ve probably noticed that the acronym for this method spells  
AARRR, which is, apparently, how pirates talk, hence the name Pirate Metrics.  
We can confidently say that neither of us has ever met a pirate, and therefore  
we cannot confirm that this is indeed pirate-speak.  
User Journey Type\: Metrics Mountain  
One of the things that’s bothered us for a while about Pirate Metrics is its visu-  
alization as a funnel. In the real world, everything you put into a funnel comes  
out of that funnel. It takes a bit longer, but the idea that some of the liquid \(for  
example\) that you pour at the top of the funnel won’t make it out the bottom  
CHAPTER 6\: BOX 2\: BUSINESS OUTCOMES  
49 is ridiculous. Of course it will. There’s a hole at the other end! There had to be  
a better metaphor.  
Instead of a funnel, we present Metrics Mountain \(Figure 6-2\).  
Figure 6-2. Metrics Mountain. Concept by Jeff Patton and Jeff Gothelf.  
The idea of a mountain to visualize the customer life cycle makes perfect sense  
because our goal is to get as many of our customers to the top of the moun-  
tain. Realistically, though, we’re going to lose people along the way. They’ll get  
tired. They’ll get bored. They’ll get distracted. They’ll defect to a competitor.  
Not every one of them will make it through \(i.e., where the funnel metaphor  
breaks\).  
As your customers make their way up Metrics Mountain, they are asked to do  
more and more with your product or service \(the climb gets harder\). Your goal  
is to make that as easy a process as possible and to motivate them to keep  
going. Some of them will do that—especially if you have a compelling value  
proposition, user experience, and business model. But increasingly, as your cus-  
tomers make their way up the mountain, they will drop off. Our goal should  
be to build the kinds of experiences that get the highest percentage of people to  
the top of the mountain.  
Facilitating Your Business Outcomes Conversation  
with Metrics Mountain  
You can use the mountain metaphor to facilitate the conversation with your  
team and stakeholders about the behaviors you believe your users should be  
progressing through as they use your product. Here’s how to do that\:  
50  
LEAN UX 1\. Start at the base and identify the first thing a user has to do to begin using  
your product. How do you acquire them? How do they find the new fea-  
ture you’re working on?  
2\. Define a “plateau” on the mountain for each subsequent step of your cus-  
tomer journey and determine the user behavior it takes to get there.  
3\. What percentage of users moving their way up the mountain would your  
team consider successful for each step? Add those numbers to the moun-  
tain diagram.  
• For example, of the 100% of your daily visitors, you would like to see  
at least 75% discover the new feature you’re building, and 50% of those  
folks give it a try. From there, you’d like to see at least 25% of those  
who tried to continue using the feature on a weekly basis, with 10% of  
them ultimately paying you for this new capability.  
4\. If you’re not sure about your exact customer journey, start with Pirate  
Metrics as the five “ledges” of the mountain. This is a good way to kick  
off this exercise.  
User Journey Type\: Service Journeys and User Story Maps  
Sometimes, visualizing the user journey as a funnel or a mountain doesn’t  
make sense. You know your product well, and these models may not apply to  
you. Don’t force it. Instead, you can build a Service Journey Map or User Story  
Map that more closely maps the way a user moves through your product or  
service. The form isn’t really important here\: use the method that makes sense  
for you and your product. The goal is to be able to visualize the flow through  
the product in a way that you can all see and understand, then use that model  
to zoom in on the most important parts of the journey, identify the specific  
behaviors crucial to the success of your initiative, and determine the outcome  
metrics that would indicate success for that journey.  
# Outcome-to-Impact Mapping  
Outcome-to-impact mapping is another technique to visualize the connection  
between the impact metrics in your business problem statement and the tacti-  
cal outcomes you hope to see in your customers. It works well with your  
feature-level team and is also a powerful exercise to do together with your  
stakeholders.  
This exercise also visualizes the concept of leading and lagging indicators.  
You’ll find that impact metrics are more often lagging indicators—backward-  
looking measures of what’s already taken place. As this exercise progresses,  
CHAPTER 6\: BOX 2\: BUSINESS OUTCOMES  
51 you’ll find many of the lower-level metrics, the outcomes, to be leading indica-  
tors. These behaviors are often the things that need to take place before we can  
achieve the impact metric. For example, a customer must first download our  
app before they can spend money on our service. The former is a leading indi-  
cator of the latter. What teams often find is there are many leading indicators  
for one or two impact metrics. This exercise helps shed light on that fact and  
forces a \(hopefully\) productive conversation about prioritization.  
Here’s how it works\:  
1\. Gather the team and the product leads into a meeting room.  
2\. On a whiteboard, ask the highest paid person in the room to write down  
the current strategic goal for the year at the top on a series of Post-it notes.  
3\. Below that, ask that same person \(or another executive\) to list out the  
measures of success for that strategy \(hint\: these should be impact metrics  
and are often lagging indicators\).  
4\. Below each impact metric, start to draw lines protruding away from each  
one \(like you’re building an org chart\).  
5\. Ask the room to fill out the line below the impact metrics with customer  
behaviors that drive those metrics \(leading indicators\). Use Post-its and  
have everyone work individually on an initial brainstorm.  
6\. Now have the team do another row below the last one showing the cus-  
tomer behaviors that drive the initial set of outcomes.  
At this point, your whiteboard should start to look like the map shown in  
Figure 6-3\:  
Figure 6-3. Outcome-to-impact mapping  
52  
LEAN UX Once everyone’s contributed, you should have dozens of Post-its on the board  
indicating a variety of customer behaviors \(outcomes\) that will help your com-  
pany hit its strategic goal and impact targets. Also at this point, your team may  
be overwhelmed. Most times we’ve run this exercise, it never occurs to the  
team that there are so many ways to potentially drive positive change.  
Now, the tough part. Through a round of dot voting \(or other facilitated selec-  
tion exercise\), ask the team to pick the 10 outcomes they think they should  
focus on first.  
What you’ve done here is create a direct connection between outcomes \(cus-  
tomer behaviors\) and impact metrics \(the thing executives care about\) and  
forced them to choose where you should focus for the next cycle. The last step  
is to create a baseline for each of these outcomes \(i.e., where they are today\)  
and a goal \(i.e., where we’d like them to be at the end of the cycle\) and assign  
them to the team as goals for their next cycle.  
Now, each time a team reports progress on their specific outcome, their stake-  
holder will have a clear sense of why the team is working on that and how it  
affects the impact metrics they care most about.  
# What to Watch Out For  
Not every number or percentage is an outcome metric. Jeff was working with a  
huge German retail conglomerate on this specific exercise. Their impact-level  
goal was to increase same store sales year over year. As we worked through the  
outcome-to-impact mapping exercise, a few team members added items to the  
outcome rows that read “percentage of products on the shelf that are our  
brand.” Now, technically, this is a metric, but it is not a measure of customer  
behavior. It is a product strategy decision that you hope will drive some cus-  
tomer behavior. A similar issue came up once with another client building an  
automation tool. A person on the team listed “percentage of manual tasks now  
automated by the system.” Again, this is not a measure of customer behavior.  
It’s a facet of the system being built, a product decision. The ultimate goal was  
to reduce the amount of time staff spent on repetitive tasks—which is a good  
outcome metric.  
The other thing we’ve seen often is that these charts get messy. It’s easy to  
make them look neat in a book or PowerPoint slide. In reality, our businesses  
aren’t this linear, and these charts can get a bit unwieldy \(Figure 6-4\). Teams  
will often find that one outcome drives multiple impact metrics \(this is per-  
fectly reasonable\) and has to be duplicated across the chart. Build the chart  
that works for your business and your team. Just don’t compromise the con-  
tent of the exercise.

# Box 3\: Users  
Figure 7-1. Box 3 of the Lean UX Canvas\: Users  
Designers have long been advocates for the end user. Lean UX doesn’t change  
that. As we make assumptions about our business and the outcomes we’d like  
to achieve, we still need to keep the user front and center in our thinking. Box  
3 of the canvas begins a deeper conversation into our target audience.  
Most of us learned to think about a persona as a tool to represent what we  
learned in our research. And it was often the case that we created personas as  
the output of lengthy, expensive research studies. There are a few problems  
with personas that are created this way.  
55 First, we tend to regard them as untouchable because of all of the work that  
went into creating them. In addition, it’s often the case that these personas  
were created by a research team or third-party vendor. This creates a risky  
knowledge gap between the people who conducted the research and those who  
are using the personas.  
In Lean UX, we change the order of operations in the persona process. We also  
change persona creation from a one-time activity to an ongoing process—one  
that takes place whenever we learn something new about our users.  
When creating personas in this approach, we start with assumptions and then  
do research to validate our assumption. Instead of spending months in the field  
interviewing people, we spend a few hours creating proto-personas. Proto-  
personas are our best guess as to who is using \(or will use\) our product and  
why. We sketch them on paper with the entire team contributing—we want to  
capture everyone’s assumptions. Then, as we conduct ongoing research, we  
quickly find out how accurate our initial guesses are, and we adjust our per-  
sonas in response.  
Besides putting the customer front and center for a diverse product develop-  
ment team, proto-personas serve two more key purposes.  
Shared understanding  
Imagine your team sitting around a table and someone says the word  
“dog.” What image comes to your mind? Is it the same image that comes  
to your colleagues’ minds \(Figure 7-2\)? How do you know?  
Figure 7-2. Dogs. We are indebted to our learned colleague  
Adrian Howard for this concept.  
The same thing happens when someone says, “the user.” The proto-  
persona approach ensures that everyone has the same image in their head  
when “the user” is invoked.  
56  
LEAN UX Remembering we are not the user  
It is often easy to assume our users are like us—especially if we consume  
the products we make. The reality is that we have a level of understanding  
and tolerance for the technology that our customers rarely share. Going  
through a proto-persona exercise puts the focus on external users, pushing  
the team further away from their personal preferences for the product.  
Using Proto-Personas  
A team we were working with in New York was building an app that improved the  
Community Supported Agriculture \(CSA\) experience for New York City residents. CSA is  
a program that allows city residents to pool their money and purchase an entire sea-  
son’s worth of produce from a local farmer. The farmer then delivers crops weekly to  
the members of the CSA. Many subscribers to the CSA are people in their late 20s and  
early 30s who need to juggle a busy work life, an active social life, and a desire to par-  
ticipate in the CSA.  
The team assumed that most CSA consumers were women who liked to cook. They  
spent about an hour creating a persona named Susan. But when they went out into the  
field to do research with young professionals in their 20s, they quickly learned that the  
overwhelming majority of cooks, and hence potential users of their app, were young  
men. They returned to the office and revised their persona to create Anthony.  
Anthony proved to be a far more accurate target user. The team had not wasted any  
more time refining ideas for the wrong audience. They were now focused on an audi-  
ence that, while still not perfect, was far more correct than their initial assumptions.  
# The Proto-Persona Template  
We like to sketch proto-personas on paper using three hand-drawn sections  
\(Figure 7-3\). The upper-left quadrant holds a rough sketch of the persona  
along with a name and role. The upper-right box holds basic demographic,  
psychographic, and behavioral information. One antipattern for personas that  
we see is an overemphasis on demographics. For product design, we care less  
about demographics and more about needs, goals, and behaviors. So when  
you’re thinking about demographics, try to focus on information that predicts  
a specific type of behavior—behavior relevant to our product or service. For  
example, there might be cases for which the persona’s age is totally irrelevant,  
whereas their access to a specific device, like an iPhone, will completely change  
the way they interact with your product. We only want to write down the “dif-  
ferences that make a difference.”  
CHAPTER 7\: BOX 3\: USERS  
57 Figure 7-3. A completed proto-persona template  
The bottom half of the proto-persona is where we put the most important  
details. Here we capture the goals, needs, desired outcomes, and obstacles that  
keep them from achieving these needs. Remember that users rarely need “fea-  
tures.” What they need is to attain some kind of goal. \(It’s not always a con-  
crete goal\: sometimes it’s an emotional goal, an unarticulated desire, etc.\) It is  
our job to decide how best to get them to their goals.  
# Facilitating the Exercise  
Once again, we like to start the persona creation process with a brainstorm\:  
1\. Team members start by offering up their opinions on who the project  
should be targeting and how that would affect their use of the product.  
2\. The team creates a list of persona types.  
58  
LEAN UX For example, this list could contain target segments like “college students,”  
“streaming enthusiasts,” “front-line medical workers,” etc.  
3\. Narrow down the ideas to an initial set of three to four personas the team  
believes are most likely to be their target audience.  
4\. Try to differentiate the personas around needs and roles rather than by  
demographic information.  
5\. After you’ve narrowed down the list of potential users, have the team com-  
plete a proto-persona template for each one.  
You can break into small groups and have each group focus on one per-  
sona, then bring these back to the group to review.  
6\. Revise each persona based on feedback.  
Once you have a set of personas that you agree on, share with your colleagues  
beyond the team for their input.  
Early Validation  
At this point in the process, you can begin to validate some of your early  
assumptions. In fact, before you get too much further declaring assumptions,  
this is a good spot to start testing some of those assumptions. Use your per-  
sonas as recruiting targets to begin your research.  
Immediately, there are three things you can determine based on your proto-  
personas\:  
Does the customer exist?  
By recruiting for the personas you created, you can quickly determine how  
realistic your team’s assumptions are. If you can’t find the people you  
sketched, they probably don’t exist. Learn from that and edit your  
personas.  
Do they have the needs and obstacles you think they do?  
In other words, are we solving real problems? You can gauge this simply  
by observing and speaking with the individuals you recruit. If these conver-  
sations and observations don’t confirm the problem, then you’re building  
solutions for problems that don’t exist—and that rarely ends well.  
Would they value a solution to this problem?  
Just because a customer is real and has the pain points you’re solving for, it  
doesn’t actually mean they’ll value a new way to solve that problem. In  
other words, just because they eat bananas on their cereal every day and  
they don’t like slicing bananas, it doesn’t mean that they’ll buy your  
banana slicer \(Figure 7-4\). It’s important to understand how your custom-  
ers are currently solving these needs and how likely your idea is to displace  
CHAPTER 7\: BOX 3\: USERS  
59 the incumbent solution. If you’re trying to displace long-held tools like  
email or spreadsheets, you might be in for a tough fight. It’s good to get  
that information sooner rather than later.  
Figure 7-4. The banana slicer. Who buys these?  
We once worked with a startup that serviced the needs of angel investors by  
creating an online repository for all things related to their investments. It was a  
robust product that promised to streamline and simplify the lives of these  
users. Upon joining the project, we worked with the team to build proto-  
personas, and we set out to find the target audience. Turns out, this wasn’t a  
challenge at all. In the United States, at least, there are many folks who qualify  
as angel investors \(i.e., they have an extra \$50–100K sitting around to invest\).  
The persona exists!  
Next, we started speaking with these people to understand if we were solving a  
real problem for them. Turns out that, yes indeed, tracking pitch decks, term  
sheets, cap tables, and follow-on round information was tedious for this audi-  
ence. The problem exists! This was getting exciting.  
Finally, the team began to pick up on a trend when the conversation turned to  
digital solutions to this problem. The overwhelming majority of our target  
audience—something close to 95%—invested once or twice a year, maximum.  
For one or two investments per year, email and Microsoft Excel worked just  
fine. Our audience was intimately familiar with these tools, and no amount of  
robustness, complexity, or even ease of use of our online investment manage-  
ment tool was going to move our audience off email and Excel in favor of our  
60  
LEAN UX product. The tool we were building was for the 5% of investors for whom this  
was a profession—a population far too small to justify the effort being put into  
the product being built. That was a tough conversation to have back at the  
office, as you can imagine. Just because the persona exists and you’re solving a  
real problem for them doesn’t always mean they’ll value the solution you’re  
building. Better to find that out now, at Box 3 in the Lean UX Canvas, than  
once you’ve started shipping code to production.  
# What to Watch Out For  
Many teams we’ve worked with and heard from over the years run this proto-  
persona exercise; however, far fewer of them actually go back and adjust their  
thinking after the initial creation exercise. It is important that you consider  
proto-personas to be living documents. Each time you conduct customer con-  
versations or usability studies, ask yourself how many of the team’s current  
beliefs about their target audience are still true. As new information is  
revealed, bring it up for discussion and adjust the personas so that future  
research efforts can be more targeted and more successful.  
CHAPTER 7\: BOX 3\: USERS

# Box 4\: User Outcomes and Benefits  
Figure 8-1. Box 4 of the Lean UX Canvas\: User Outcomes and Benefits  
Despite the proliferation of Agile techniques like user stories, the user and their  
goals often become lost in the lengthy debates over features, designs, and tech-  
nical implementations. Empathy is at the heart of great products and services.  
Designers often have been responsible for advocating for the user from an  
empathetic point of view. As we now know, this is not uniquely a designer’s  
responsibility. To achieve broader shared understanding of users and a deeper  
sense of empathy for what they are trying to achieve, we ask our teams to  
63 declare their assumptions about what users are trying to do, in the form of  
user outcomes and benefits.  
Before starting Box 4, you may be asking yourself, what’s the difference  
between business outcomes, customer outcomes, and user outcomes? Good  
question. Let’s take a look at an example in which you work for a company  
that makes corporate expense tracking software.  
The business outcome the company is trying to achieve is to acquire more cus-  
tomers, retain the ones they already have, and increase monthly software sub-  
scription revenue.  
The customers of this company—other companies who buy the expense track-  
ing software for their employees—are trying to improve the efficiency of their  
accounting teams, reduce payment of expenses that are not reimbursable, and  
drive down overall operational costs.  
The users of the software are the employees at these customer companies.  
Their desired goal is to get their expenses reimbursed as quickly as possible  
and reduce the time it takes them to input those expenses correctly.  
All of these are still behavior-based outcomes, but each has its own point of  
view. In other words, they refer to the different goals being pursued by the dif-  
ferent groups of people.  
In addition to behavior change, there are emotional goals at both the customer  
and user levels. The buyers of this software want to feel like they are helping  
the company be more successful and profitable. They want to look good to  
their bosses and want to be able to point to their specific contributions to the  
success of the company. This would motivate them to seek out a brand of  
expense tracking software that allows them to do this easily.  
The users of the software want to get reimbursed quickly and feel confident  
their expenses will be fully reimbursed without a myriad of red tape and cor-  
porate hassle. This would motivate these users to be more diligent and deliber-  
ate in the use of this software rather than having it be yet another corporate IT  
tool that goes unused or worked around.  
It’s worth noting that all of these outcomes are important and should be called  
out specifically as business, customer, or user outcomes. However, not all of  
these are quantifiable. Meeting users’ emotional goals is hard—particularly if  
the team tends to focus on metrics, because you measure these emotional fac-  
tors in different ways. That said, just because it’s hard, doesn’t mean you  
shouldn’t pay attention to this type of goal. These emotional goals are critical\:  
they’re the ones that help teams understand what kind of experience they’re  
trying to deliver and ultimately, if you get it right, will lead to better perfor-  
mance on the quantifiable metrics.  
64  
LEAN UX Facilitating the Exercise  
Once your proto-personas have been created, you can use the material in the  
bottom portion of the proto-persona as the basis for this discussion. Working  
individually, in small groups, or as a whole team, work your way through each  
proto-persona. Use the following questions as your prompts\:  
What is the user trying to accomplish?  
Example answer\: I want to buy a new phone.  
How does the user want to feel during and after this process?  
Example answer\: I want to feel like I got the phone that I need at a good  
price and that I’m keeping up with my peers \(i.e., I want to feel cool\).  
How does our product or service get the user closer to a life goal or dream?  
Example answer\: I want to feel tech-savvy and respected for it.  
Why would your user seek out your product?  
Example answer\: I want to fit in with my friends at school.  
What behavior change can we observe that tells they’ve achieved their goal?  
Example answer\: They bring their new phone to school every day.  
Note that not every user outcome exists at all levels. But thinking about out-  
comes in these terms can help you to find important dimensions of your solu-  
tion to work on, from the functional, task-oriented outcomes to the more emo-  
tional experience-oriented outcomes.  
This section of the canvas is where the team digs into the emotional side of the  
conversation. We’re not talking about features, pixels, or code here. We want  
to understand what would drive our personas to look for our product and,  
when they find it, what they might do. When the time comes to begin testing,  
marketing, or advertising the product, the work we do in this section becomes  
a gold mine for content, calls-to-action, and helpful instructional text.  
# What to Watch Out For  
Sometimes teams get so feature-focused that this exercise becomes a bit of a  
recursive exercise. We’ve seen teams write down features in this section  
because they assume that’s what motivates their customers. Writing down a  
user benefit as “calendar integration” misses the point of this exercise. The  
goal here is to understand the user’s latent needs. “Never be late to another  
meeting” is far more important and compelling for the user than the specifics  
of the feature that will help them do that. Apple is always very good at differ-  
entiating the iPhone this way against Samsung and other competitors. While  
the competition is touting features like “12-megapixel camera,” Apple adver-  
tises, “Show grandma the baby from across the country.”  
CHAPTER 8\: BOX 4\: USER OUTCOMES AND BENEFITS

# Box 5\: Solutions  
Figure 9-1. Box 5 of the Lean UX Canvas\: Solutions  
67 Finally we’ve arrived at the point in the Lean UX process when we get to talk  
about solutions. This is by design. While we certainly could have started our  
work discussing the solutions or features we’d like to build \(and, most often,  
that’s where projects start\: with required solutions!\), our work is better when  
we step back and put some constraints in place. In our case, we’ve set con-  
straints with our business problem statement, business outcomes, the persona  
work we’ve done, and our discussion of user outcomes and benefits. Without  
those constraints, solutions will either solve the wrong problem for the wrong  
people or end up scattered and unfocused. Each set of assumptions we’ve  
declared so far has constrained the space in which we can create solutions, and  
creativity thrives in constraints.  
We’re still not getting into detailed design work here. That comes once we  
complete the canvas. However, we do start getting specific on what we believe  
will get us and our customers from their current condition to the target  
condition.  
# Facilitating the Exercise  
As with most of these assumptions declaration exercises, there are multiple  
ways to facilitate them. We’ve listed several approaches below to help you get  
started, but feel free to add your favorite design brainstorming techniques to  
help you and your team complete Box 5.  
Affinity Mapping  
Affinity mapping is the simplest and easiest way to get the team working  
together in Box 5. Have each person work individually to brainstorm solution  
ideas that would solve the business problem and achieve the desired business  
and user outcomes for your target persona. Each person should generate as  
many ideas as they can come up with, putting one idea per Post-it note. As  
with any brainstorming activity, it’s only as good as the framing question used  
to solicit responses. In this case, the question to pose to your team is\:  
What solutions can we design and build that will serve our personas and  
create their desired outcomes?  
Each person can write words or create small sketches on the Post-it notes for  
five minutes. The team then shares their ideas with each other, sorting similar  
ideas into groups before dot voting which approaches they believe stand the  
greatest chance for success.  
While affinity mapping will get you through the process the fastest, taking  
your time here can yield additional benefits beyond just identifying high-level  
solution ideas.  
68  
LEAN UXCollaborative Design\: A More Structured Approach  
A more deliberate way to develop solutions ideas is a collaborative design  
method that we call Design Studio. \(We write more about collaborative design  
methods, including Design Sprints, in Chapter 14.\) When you need to gather  
everyone for a formal working session, Design Studio is a popular way to do  
this.  
This method, born in the architecture world where it was called Design Charr-  
ette, is a way to bring a cross-functional team together to visualize potential  
solutions to a design problem. It breaks down organizational silos and creates  
a forum for your fellow teammates’ points of view.  
By putting designers, developers, subject-matter experts, product managers,  
business analysts, and other competencies together in the same space, focused  
on the same challenge, you create an outcome far greater than working in silos  
allows. It has another benefit. It begins to build the trust your team will  
need to move from these formal sessions to more frequent and informal  
collaborations.  
# Running a Design Studio  
The technique described in the sections that follow is very specific; however,  
you should feel comfortable to run less or more formal Design Studios as your  
situation and timing warrants. The specifics of the ritual are not the point as  
much as the activity of solving problems with your colleagues and clients.  
Regardless of which approach you choose, remember that the goal is to come  
up with solution ideas that solve your business problem.  
Setting  
To run a Design Studio session, you’ll want to find a dedicated block of time  
within which you can bring the team together. You should plan on at least a  
three-hour block. You’ll want a room with tables that folks can gather around.  
The room should have good wall space, so you can post the work in progress  
to the walls as you go.  
If you’re working in a remote session, use a good team whiteboard tool like  
Mural or Miro. Remember to spend some time making sure that everyone is  
comfortable with the tool you choose—you may have to spend some time at  
the start of the meeting to bring everyone up to speed on the tools.  
CHAPTER 9\: BOX 5\: SOLUTIONS  
69The Team  
This process works best for a team of five to eight people. If you have more  
people, you can create more teams and have the teams compare output at the  
end of the process. \(Larger groups take a long time to get through the critique  
and feedback steps, so it’s important to split groups larger than about eight  
people into smaller teams, which can each go through the following process in  
parallel, converging at the end.\)  
With remote sessions, this is where a videoconferencing “breakout room” fea-  
ture comes into play. Since we don’t have physical space to divide up, video  
breakout rooms give each team the privacy and focus it needs to do its own  
work.  
Process  
Design Studio works within the following flow\:  
• Problem definition and constraints  
• Individual idea generation \(diverge\)  
• Presentation and critique  
• Iterate and refine in pairs \(emerge\)  
• Team idea generation \(converge\)  
Supplies  
For in-person session, here are the supplies you’ll need\:  
• Pencils  
• Pens  
• Felt-tip markers or similar \(multiple colors/thickness\)  
• Highlighters \(multiple colors\)  
• Sketching templates \(you can use preprinted one-up and six-up templates,  
or you can use blank sheets of 11” x 17” \[A3\] paper divided into six  
boxes\)  
• 25” x 30.5” \(A1\) self-stick easel pads  
• Drafting dots \(or any kind of small stickers\)  
With distributed teams, all of these tools become moot in favor of the online  
collaboration tool you’ve chosen to use. That said, we’ve seen some remote  
facilitators still challenge folks to use paper and pen for initial sketches,  
70  
LEAN UX photograph those sketches, and share them in the online whiteboard tool after  
creating it locally.  
Problem Definition and Constraints \(15 Minutes\)  
The first step in Design Studio is to ensure that everyone is aware of the  
assumptions you’ve declared so far\: the business problem you are trying to  
solve, the outcomes that define success for the effort, the users you are serving,  
and the benefits they are trying to achieve. In most cases, the team is already  
aware of this since they’ve worked on the canvas together up until this point. If  
you haven’t done this work together, plan some extra time for briefing the  
team and answering their questions.  
Individual Idea Generation \(10 Minutes\)  
You’ll be working individually in this step. Give each member of the team a  
six-up template, which is a sheet of paper with six empty boxes on it, as depic-  
ted in Figure 9-2. You can make one by folding a blank sheet of 11” x 17”  
\(A3\) paper, or make a preprinted template to hand to participants. \(If you’re  
using an online tool, don’t force people to draw in that tool—that tends to be  
hard and slow. Instead, ask people to work on paper then share a photo or  
scan.\)  
Figure 9-2. A blank “six-up” template  
CHAPTER 9\: BOX 5\: SOLUTIONS  
71 Sometimes, people find they have a hard time facing a blank page. If that’s the  
case, try this optional step. Ask everyone to label each box on their sheets with  
one of your personas and the specific pain point or problem they will be  
addressing for that persona. Write the persona’s name and pain point at the  
top of each of the six boxes. You can write the same persona/pain point pair as  
many times as you have solutions for that problem, or you can write a differ-  
ent persona/pain point combination for each box. Any combination works.  
Spend five minutes doing this.  
Next, with your six-up sheets in front of you, give everyone five minutes to  
generate six low-fidelity sketches of solutions \(see Figure 9-3\) for each persona/  
problem pair on their six-up sheet. These should be visual articulations \(UI  
sketches, workflows, diagrams, etc.\) and not written words. Encourage your  
team by revealing the dirty little secret of interaction design\: if you can draw a  
circle, square, and a triangle, you can draw every interface. We’re confident  
everyone on your team can draw those shapes, and this seemingly silly idea can  
help level the playing field.  
Figure 9-3. A wall full of completed six-up drawings  
Presentation and Critique \(3 Minutes per Person\)  
When time is up, share and critique what you’ve done so far. Going around the  
room, give the participants three minutes to share their sketches and present  
72  
LEAN UX them to the team \(Figure 9-4\). Presenters should explicitly state who they were  
solving a problem for \(in other words, what persona\) and which pain point  
they were addressing, and then explain the sketch.  
Each member of the team should provide critique and feedback to the pre-  
senter. Team members should focus their feedback on clarifying the presenter’s  
intentions.  
Help your team understand that giving good feedback is an art. Remind them  
that, in general, it’s better to ask questions than to share opinions. Questions  
help the team talk about what they’re doing and help individuals think  
through their work. Opinions, on the other hand, can stop the conversation,  
inhibit collaboration, and put people on the defensive. So when you’re provid-  
ing critique, try to use questions like “How does this feature address the per-  
sona’s specific problem?” or “I don’t understand that part of the drawing. Can  
you elaborate?” Questions like these are very helpful. Comments such as “I  
don’t like that concept” provide little value and don’t give the presenter con-  
crete ideas to use for iterating.  
Figure 9-4. A team presenting and critiquing drawings during a Design Studio  
Pair Up to Iterate and Refine \(10 Minutes\)  
Now ask everyone to pair up for the next round. \(If two people in the session  
had similar ideas, it’s a good idea to ask them to work together.\) For remote  
sessions, each pair should work in their own breakout room.  
CHAPTER 9\: BOX 5\: SOLUTIONS  
73 Each pair will be working to revise their design ideas \(Figure 9-5\). The goal  
here is to have each pair pick the ideas that have the most merit and develop a  
more evolved, more integrated version of those ideas. Each pair will have to  
make some decisions about what to keep, what to change, and what to throw  
away. Expect that this will be hard and that each pair will disagree about some  
things. Resist the temptation here to create quick agreement by getting more  
general or abstract. Instead, ask each pair to make some decisions and get  
more specific. Have each pair produce a single drawing on an 11” × 17” \(A3\)  
six-up sheet. Give each team 10 minutes for this step.  
When the time is up, bring everyone together and go through the present-and-  
critique process again.  
Figure 9-5. A team working together in a Design Studio exercise  
Team Idea Generation \(45 Minutes\)  
Now that all team members have feedback on their individual ideas and people  
have paired up to develop ideas further, the team must converge on one idea.  
In this step, the team is trying to select the ideas they feel have the best chance  
for success. This set of ideas will serve as the basis for the next step in the Lean  
UX process\: creating hypotheses and, eventually, designing and running  
experiments.  
74  
LEAN UX Ask the team to use a large sheet of self-stick easel pad paper or a whiteboard  
to sketch the components and workflow for their idea. There will be a lot of  
compromise and wrangling at this stage, and to get to consensus, the team will  
need to prioritize and pare back features.  
Encourage the team to create a “parking lot” for good ideas that don’t make  
the cut. This will make it easier to let go of ideas. Again, it’s important to  
make decisions here\: resist the temptation to get consensus by generalizing or  
deferring decisions.  
NOTE  
If you have split a large group into multiple teams in the Design Studio, ask each  
team to present their final idea to the room when they are finished for one final  
round of critique and feedback and, if desired, convergence.  
Using the Output  
The work you do in a Design Studio will feed into the creation of hypotheses  
and ultimately experiment design. This doesn’t mean that every single idea will  
make it into final consideration, but the ideas the team has converged on will  
all be put to the test starting with Box 6, hypothesis creation.  
To keep the output visible, post it on a design wall or another prominent place  
so that the team can refer back to it. Decide on what \(if any\) intermediate  
drawings people want to keep and display these alongside the final drawing,  
again so that team members can refer back to the ideas. Regardless of what  
you keep posted on the wall, it’s generally a good idea to photograph every-  
thing and keep it in an archive folder of some sort. You never know when  
you’ll want to go back to find something. It’s also a good idea to put a single  
person in charge of creating this archive. Creating some accountability will  
tend to ensure that the team keeps good records.  
# What to Watch Out For  
The toughest part of collaborative design is ensuring even participation. If you  
keep the exercise simple, most folks will feel like they can participate quite  
easily. \(Everyone can write on a Post-it note.\) If you decide to use more  
involved techniques like Design Studio, you’ll need to ensure that facilitation is  
top notch. \(And remember that this will all be more difficult in remote ses-  
sions.\) If members of your team tune out during this part because they feel like  
these exercises were too advanced for them, they’re likely to put up a much  
bigger resistance to some of the feature and design choices the team makes  
downstream. In this instance, as much as anywhere else, design facilitation  
becomes a core skill set for the designers on your team.  
CHAPTER 9\: BOX 5\: SOLUTIONS  
75 C H A P T E R 1 0  
# Box 6\: Hypotheses  
Figure 10-1. Box 6 of the Lean UX Canvas\: Hypotheses  
When the team arrives at Box 6, it has all the raw material it needs to start  
writing tactical, testable hypotheses. Before we do that, though, let’s talk about  
hypotheses in general.  
Hypothesis has become a popular word in product development recently, in no  
small part because of The Lean Startup, in which Eric Ries describes a method  
of product development inspired by the scientific method. He advocates testing  
your hypotheses early and often. So what is a hypothesis anyway? According  
to The Oxford Dictionary of Difficult Words, it’s “a supposition or proposed  
77 explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for fur-  
ther investigation.”1  
That’s what we’re about to create\: we’re going to take all of our assumptions  
\(assumptions are statements based on “limited evidence”\), and we’re going to  
gather them into a unified statement \(our “proposed explanation” of our prob-  
lem and solution\) so that we can begin our research and testing process \(our  
“further investigation”\).  
OK, with that out of the way, let’s get started writing hypotheses. This is the  
template we recommend\:  
We believe we will achieve \[this business outcome\]  
If \[these personas\]  
Attain \[this benefit/user outcome\]  
With \[this feature or solution\]  
The template starts with the words “we believe.” This is explicit because we  
don’t know. We’re making assumptions. And then we complete the hypothesis  
template based on the material we’ve created in every canvas box before this  
one. We pull business outcomes from Box 2, personas from Box 3, benefits  
from Box 4, and solutions from Box 5. In some ways, this part of the process  
is just fill-in-the-blanks.  
But we need to do a little more than that. Our goal here is to write hypotheses  
that make sense and that we believe. These hypotheses are, in essence, very  
short stories designed to build support for pursuing a particular design direc-  
tion. Writing a good hypothesis that makes sense and that you and your team  
believe is actually the first way to test the validity of your solution brainstorms.  
If you can’t put together a compelling hypothesis statement for one of the solu-  
tion ideas in Box 5, then that idea shouldn’t graduate to the next part of the  
process. And, just to be extra clear, a compelling hypothesis is one where the  
feature has a clear user, the user gets an obvious benefit from the feature, and  
the subsequent user behavior change helps solve the business problem we  
articulated in Box 1.  
1 Archie Hobson \(ed.\), The Oxford Dictionary of Difficult Words \(New York\: Oxford University  
Press, 2004\), s.v. “hypothesis.”  
78  
LEAN UX Facilitating the Exercise  
We like to create a table like the one in Figure 10-2 and then complete it by  
using the material we’ve filled in the earlier parts of the canvas. We physically  
move our Post-it notes into the appropriate boxes to make rows of related  
ideas. Each column is directly related to a specific box of the canvas, from Box  
2 on the left to Box 5 on the right.  
Figure 10-2. A hypothesis table  
You’ll often find during this exercise that there are gaps in your initial brain-  
storms. Some business outcomes might have no features created for them,  
whereas some features might not drive any value for the customer or the busi-  
ness. That’s part of the point of this exercise\: to organize and make sense of  
your initial round of thinking. After you’ve identified the gaps in your brain-  
storms, fill them in with new sticky notes \(Figure 10-3\) or—even better—leave  
the less relevant ideas off the chart. This will help make sense of the undoubt-  
edly large number of ideas your team generates.  
With distributed teams using a virtual whiteboard tool, this exercise becomes  
even easier. Copy and paste your notes from other parts of the canvas into Box  
6 and move them around as necessary to complete the chart.  
CHAPTER 10\: BOX 6\: HYPOTHESES  
79 Figure 10-3. Working on the hypothesis chart  
After you’ve completed the chart—7 to 10 rows are a good initial target—  
begin extracting feature hypotheses from it. Use the hypothesis template to  
ensure you’re including all the relevant components of the hypothesis state-  
ment. Here’s that template again\:  
We believe we will achieve \[this business outcome\]  
If \[these personas\]  
Attain \[this benefit/user outcome\]  
With \[this feature or solution\]  
As you write your hypotheses, consider which persona\(s\) you’re serving with  
your proposed solutions. It’s not unusual to find solutions that serve more than  
one persona at a time. It’s also not unusual to create a hypothesis in which  
multiple features drive similar outcomes. When you see that happening, refine  
the hypothesis to focus on just one feature. Hypotheses with multiple features  
are not easy to test. The important thing to remember in this entire process is  
to keep your ideas specific enough so that you can create meaningful tests to  
see if your ideas hold water.  
80  
LEAN UXWhat’s the Difference Between Hypotheses and  
Agile User Stories?  
We’re often asked to differentiate between hypothesis statements and classic Agile  
user stories. The difference is subtle but powerful. One of the more popular formats for  
Agile user stories look like this\:  
As a \<type of user\>,  
I want \<some goal\>  
so that \<some reason\>.  
You’ll notice that the user and user outcome are present in this story. That said, most  
teams we’ve worked with replace “some goal” with “this feature.” After the user story is  
written, most teams discard the pieces around “some goal” and begin implementing  
the feature. The user is quickly forgotten as the team works diligently to drive up their  
velocity and deliver the feature. The team’s acceptance criteria \(i.e., their definition of  
success\) is that the system allows the user to complete a task. There is no discussion as  
to whether the solution is usable or desirable, much less delightful. There’s no discus-  
sion of whether the feature creates an outcome. The only testing being done is  
whether the system “works as designed.”  
Hypotheses have behavior change \(business outcomes\) as their definition of success.  
Shipping a working feature is table stakes. It’s the beginning of the conversation. Our  
team’s success is not measured by how fast they can get features launched. Instead, we  
measure success by how well our customers can achieve “some goal” initially and  
continuously.  
This is the key difference between user stories and hypotheses. They refocus the team  
on what’s really important—making the customer successful and thus achieving a  
business goal—as opposed to measuring team productivity as success.  
That said, you still need a way to talk about output and features—the things that the  
team is building. If your user stories are feature-centric, that’s fine. In fact, it’s often the  
case that a given hypothesis results in many user stories. However you decide to track  
the work is fine. Just make sure that some part of your process connects the work  
you’re doing on the feature level to the higher-level user and business outcomes that  
you’re trying to create.  
# Prioritizing Hypotheses  
Lean UX is an exercise in ruthless prioritization. It’s rare to have a project  
budget focused strictly on learning. In most cases, we need to ship product too.  
The reason we declare our assumptions at the outset of our work is so that we  
can identify project risks and prioritize. What’s risky and needs testing? What’s  
not risky and thus easy to start?  
CHAPTER 10\: BOX 6\: HYPOTHESES  
81 After we string our assumptions together into hypotheses, we create a backlog  
of potential work. Next, we need to figure out which ones are the riskiest  
ones—so that we can work on them first. Understanding that you can’t test  
every assumption, how do you decide which one to test first?  
There are lots of ways that you can prioritize, but we’ve found that it can often  
be helpful to do this collaboratively and to have a framework to use for this  
work. That’s why we created the Hypothesis Prioritization Canvas shown in  
Figure 10-4. \(Yes, another canvas.\) The HPC is a two-by-two matrix with the  
x-axis measuring risk, and the y-axis measuring perceived value. We use “per-  
ceived” value because this is a big assumption. We believe that an idea has  
high perceived value if its implementation will meaningfully impact the user  
experience and therefore the business. When it comes to risk, we evaluate each  
hypothesis on its own merit. Some hypotheses are going to be technically risky.  
Some will pose risk to the brand. Others will challenge our design capabilities.  
In this case, we don’t normalize for a specific type of risk so we can consider  
all aspects of risk for each hypothesis.  
Figure 10-4. The Hypothesis Prioritization Canvas  
Map your hypotheses on the canvas as a team.  
• The hypotheses that land in quadrant 1 are the hypotheses we are going to  
test. They graduate to Boxes 7 and 8 in the Lean UX Canvas.  
• If a hypothesis lands in quadrant 2 of the HPC—high value, low risk—  
we’re going to build it. Write the user stories, put them on the backlog,  
82  
LEAN UX and ship them. But don’t forget to measure that feature once it’s live. If it  
doesn’t live up to your expectations—aka the business outcomes defined in  
the hypothesis as success—you need to revisit this idea.  
• Any hypothesis that falls below the risk axis into the low perceived value  
area doesn’t get tested. If it lands in quadrant 4 of the HPC—high risk,  
low value—we throw it away. No need to build it either.  
• Hypotheses that end up in quadrant 3 of the HPC—low risk, low value—  
don’t get tested and in most cases don’t get built. However, there will be  
some hypotheses that end up here that, while not particularly valuable or  
risky, still need to get built so you can operate your business. For example,  
you will have to implement a payment system if you’re building an ecom-  
merce service, but that won’t differentiate you in the marketplace. In this  
case, we build the basic use cases knowing that our innovative and delight-  
ful features—the riskier features—are going to be tested and validated  
before implementation.  
# What to Watch Out For  
Hypothesis writing, like most new techniques, gets better with practice. Teams  
will often write hypotheses that are too big to test early in their Lean UX jour-  
ney. If you find yourself in this situation, rethink the scope of your hypothesis.  
How can you make it smaller? How can you size the hypothesis to a point  
where your team can have total ownership over its scope?  
Hypothesis writing, like business problem statement writing, also benefits from  
specificity. Use specific numbers in your business outcomes. Be clear about the  
feature you’d like to build. This is another area where phrases like “better user  
experience” and “intuitive UI” don’t make sense. If you’re asked to test that  
“intuitive UI” \(and, to be clear, you will be in the next step of the canvas,\)  
what will you test? Consider replacing ambiguous phrases like that with more  
specific ones like “one-click checkout” or “face recognition authentication.”

# Box 7\: What’s the Most Important Thing  
# We Need to Learn First?  
Figure 11-1. Box 7 of the Lean UX Canvas\: Learning  
Once you’ve prioritized your hypotheses and identified which hypotheses  
you’re going to test, the next step in the process is highlighting the major risks  
in each hypothesis. To do this, we ask the first of the two key Lean UX ques-  
tions\: What’s the most important thing we need to learn first about this  
hypothesis?  
85 When we ask about learning, we’re really having a conversation about risk.  
We want to uncover all the things that might break our hypothesis. If you’re  
doing this with a cross-functional team, as we’ve advised throughout the book,  
you’re going to get at least as many answers to this question as there are disci-  
plines in the room. The software engineers will discuss the complexities of  
developing the feature. The designers will bring up workflow issues and usabil-  
ity concerns. Product managers will challenge whether it will deliver the busi-  
ness benefits we anticipate. All of these risks are valid, but the ones we want to  
focus on now are the ones that will render the hypothesis invalid and allow us  
to move on quickly if we’re wrong.  
In the early stages of the hypothesis’s life cycle, the biggest risk is usually  
related to the value of the solution. Do people need a solution? Will they look  
for it? Will they try it? Will they use it? Will they find value in it? These are the  
things that matter early on. If the answer to these questions is “no,” then  
there’s no need to worry about how we’re going to design or build it. If we’re  
dealing with a more mature hypothesis, one where the value has been validated  
and we’ve moved on to the technical implementation, then thinking through  
things like technical challenges, usability, and scalability become the next logi-  
cal risks to explore.  
# Facilitating the Exercise  
Generally speaking, this is a conversation. The team sits down to review the  
hypothesis prioritization and determines which ones it wants to test first. Then  
ask the question what’s the most important thing we need to learn first about  
this hypothesis? If the conversation gets stuck, you might choose to brainstorm  
here, then do some affinity mapping and dot voting. Or you might defer to  
some member of the team who holds a strong opinion. Generally, this step  
doesn’t need a lot of process. The point here is to identify the top one to three  
risks related to this hypothesis, then move on to planning your experiment,  
which you’ll do in Box 8.  
# What to Watch Out For  
Consensus is nice but not always attainable. If you find that team discussion  
not reaching a consensus, it’s a clear indication the team needs more informa-  
tion to make that decision. The only way to do that is to make a decision and  
move forward to Box 8 to create an experiment. In most cases, the product  
manager can make this call. When you do this, remember that we’re not aban-  
doning these hypotheses, assumptions, and risks forever. We’re simply moving  
forward with one and, if proven false, will come back to the backlog of  
hypotheses to do the process again.

# Box 8\: MVPs and Experiments  
Figure 12-1. Box 8 of the Lean UX Canvas\: MVPs and Experiments  
The final step in the Lean UX Canvas is focused on experimentation. The sec-  
ond key question of the canvas we have to answer is What’s the least amount  
of work we need to do to learn the next most important thing? The answer to  
this question is the experiment you’re going to run to test your hypothesis.  
Doing the least amount of work isn’t lazy. It’s lean. Remember, we’re trying to  
eliminate waste, and extra work spent testing your idea is waste. In fact, the  
faster you find out if your idea is something you should continue working on,  
the less you invest in it. This makes changing course much easier, which increa-  
ses the agility of the team.  
87 The experiments you come up with in Box 8 are your minimum viable prod-  
ucts or MVP. In fact, this is the exact definition of MVP from Eric Ries’s The  
Lean Startup.  
# What Is an MVP Anyway?  
If you ask a room full of technology professionals the question “What is an  
MVP?” you’re likely to hear a lengthy and diverse list that includes such gems  
as the ones that follow\:  
“It’s the fastest thing we can get out the door that still works.”  
“It’s an ugly release that’s full of compromises and makes everyone  
unhappy.”  
“It’s whatever the client says it is.”  
“It’s the minimum set of features that allows us to say, ‘it works.’”  
“It’s phase 1.” \(And we all know about the likelihood of phase 2.\)  
The phrase MVP has caused a lot of confusion in its short life. The problem is  
that it gets used in at least two different ways. Sometimes the term is used to  
mean “a small and fast release.” That’s the meaning that the quotes above refer  
to. That’s not how we use the phrase.  
When we say MVP, we are talking about a small and fast way of learning  
something. Sometimes, this is a software release. Sometimes, it’s not—it can be  
a drawing, a landing page, or a prototype. Your primary concern is not to cre-  
ate value but to create learning. Now, these two ideas are not mutually exclu-  
sive. After all, one of the key things you’re trying to learn is what the market  
finds valuable. Oftentimes, a good MVP will create both value and learning.  
For us, though, the point of an MVP is that it’s focused on learning.  
Example\: Should We Launch a Newsletter?  
Let’s take for example a medium-sized company we consulted with a few years  
ago. They were exploring new marketing tactics and wanted to launch a  
monthly newsletter. Creating a successful newsletter is no small task. You need  
to prepare a content strategy, editorial calendar, layout and design, as well as  
an ongoing marketing and distribution strategy. You need writers and editors  
to work on it. All in all, it was a big expenditure for the company to under-  
take. The team decided to treat this newsletter idea as a hypothesis.  
The team asked themselves\: What’s the most important thing we need to learn  
first? The answer\: Was there enough customer demand for a newsletter to jus-  
tify the effort? The MVP the company used to test the idea was a sign-up form  
on their current website. The sign-up form promoted the newsletter and asked  
88  
LEAN UX for a customer’s email address. This approach wouldn’t deliver any value to  
the customer—yet. Instead, the goal was to measure demand and build insight  
on what value proposition and language drove sign-ups. The team felt that  
these tests would give them enough information to make a good decision  
about whether to proceed.  
The team spent half a day designing and coding the form and was able to  
launch it that same afternoon. The team knew that their site received a signifi-  
cant amount of traffic each day\: they would be able to learn very quickly if  
there was interest in the newsletter.  
At this point, the team made no effort to design or build the actual newsletter.  
They would do that only after they’d gathered enough data from their first  
experiment, and only if the data showed that its customers wanted the newslet-  
ter. If the data was positive, the team would move on to their next MVP, one  
that would begin to deliver value and create deeper learning around the type of  
content, presentation format, frequency, social distribution, and the other  
things they would need to learn to create a good newsletter. The team planned  
to continue experimenting with MVP versions of the newsletter—each one  
improving on its predecessor—that would provide more and different types of  
content and design, and ultimately deliver the business benefit they were  
seeking.  
# Creating an MVP  
When it comes to creating an MVP, the first question is always what is the  
most important thing we need to learn next? In most cases, the answer to that  
will either be a question of value or a question of implementation. In either  
case, you’ll want to design an experiment that provides you with enough evi-  
dence to answer your question and help you decide whether or not to continue  
with the idea.  
Creating an MVP to Understand Value  
Here are some guidelines to follow if you’re trying to understand the value of  
your idea\:  
Get to the point  
Regardless of the MVP method you choose to use, focus your time distill-  
ing your idea to its core value proposition and present that to your cus-  
tomers. The things that surround your idea \(things like navigation, logins,  
and password retrieval flows\) will be irrelevant if your idea itself has no  
value to your target audience. Leave that stuff for later.  
CHAPTER 12\: BOX 8\: MVPS AND EXPERIMENTS  
89 Use a clear call to action  
You will know people value your solution when they demonstrate intent to  
use it or \(gasp!\) pay for it. Giving people a way to opt in to or sign up for  
a service is a great way to know if they’re interested and whether they’d  
actually give you money for it.  
Measure behavior  
Build MVPs with which you can observe and measure what people do.  
This lets you bypass what people say they \(will\) do in favor of what they  
actually do. In digital product design, behavior trumps opinion.  
Talk to your users  
Measuring behavior tells you what people did with your MVP. Without  
knowing why they behaved that way, iterating your MVP is an act of ran-  
dom design. Try to capture conversations from both those who converted  
as well as those who didn’t.  
Prioritize ruthlessly  
Ideas are cheap and plentiful. Let the best ones prove themselves, so don’t  
hold on to invalidated ideas just because you like them. As designers our-  
selves, we know that this one is particularly difficult to practice. Designers  
tend to be optimists, and often we believe our solutions, whether we  
worked on them for five minutes or five months, are well-crafted and  
properly thought out. Remember, if the results of your experiment disagree  
with your hypothesis, you’re wrong.  
Stay agile  
Learnings will come in quickly; make sure you’re working in a medium or  
tool that allows you to make updates easily.  
Don’t reinvent the wheel  
Many of the tools, systems, and mechanisms that you need to test your  
ideas already exist. Consider how you could use email, SMS, chat apps,  
Facebook Groups, Shopify storefronts, no-code tools, discussion forums,  
and other existing tools to get the learning you’re seeking.  
Creating an MVP to Understand Implementation  
Here are some guidelines to follow if you’re trying to understand the imple-  
mentation you’re considering launching to your customers\:  
Be functional  
Some level of integration with the rest of your application must be in place  
to create a realistic usage scenario. Creating your new workflow in the  
context of the existing functionality is important here.  
90  
LEAN UX Integrate with existing analytics  
Measuring the performance of your MVP must be done within the context  
of existing product workflows. This will help you to understand the num-  
bers you’re seeing.  
Be consistent with the rest of the application  
To minimize any biases toward the new functionality, design your MVP to  
fit with your current look, feel, and brand.  
Some Final Guidelines for Creating MVPs  
MVPs might seem simple but in practice can prove challenging. Like most  
skills, the more you practice, the better you become at doing it. In the mean-  
time, here are some guidelines to building valuable MVPs.  
It’s not easy to be pure  
You’ll find that it’s not always possible to test only one thing at a time\:  
you’re often trying to learn whether your idea has value and determine  
implementation details at the same time. Although it’s better to separate  
these processes, keeping the aforementioned guidelines in mind as you plan  
your MVPs will help you to navigate the trade-offs and compromises  
you’re going to have to make.  
Be clear about your learning goals  
Make sure that you know what you’re trying to learn, and make sure you  
are clear about what data you need to collect to learn. It’s a bad feeling to  
launch an experiment only to discover you haven’t instrumented correctly  
and are failing to capture some important data.  
Start small  
Regardless of your desired outcome, build the smallest MVP possible.  
Remember that it is a tool for learning. You will be iterating. You will be  
modifying it. You might very well be throwing it away entirely. It’ll be  
much easier to throw it away if you didn’t spend a lot of time building it.  
You don’t necessarily need code  
In many cases, your MVP won’t involve any code at all. Instead, you will  
rely on many of the UX designer’s existing tools\: sketching, prototyping,  
copywriting, and visual design.  
CHAPTER 12\: BOX 8\: MVPS AND EXPERIMENTS  
91The Truth Curve  
The amount of effort you put into your MVP should be proportional to the  
amount of evidence you have that your idea is a good one. That’s the point of  
the chart \(Figure 12-2\) created by Giff Constable.1 The x-axis shows the level  
of investment you should put into your MVP. The y-axis shows the amount of  
market-based evidence you have about your idea. The more evidence you have,  
the higher the fidelity and complexity of your MVP can be. \(You’ll need the  
extra effort, because what you need to learn becomes more complex.\) The less  
evidence you have, the less effort you want to put into your MVP. Remember  
the second key question\: What’s the smallest thing that you can do to learn the  
next most important thing? Anything more than that is waste.  
Figure 12-2. Our adapted version of the Truth Curve is a useful reminder that learning is  
continuous, and increased investment is only warranted when the facts dictate it  
# Examples of MVPs  
Let’s take a look at a few different types of MVPs that are in common use.  
Landing Page Test  
This type of MVP helps a team determine demand for their product. It involves  
creating a marketing page with a clear value proposition, a call to action, and  
a way to measure conversion. Teams must drive relevant traffic to this landing  
page to get a large enough sample size for the results to be useful. They can do  
1 Giff Constable, “The Truth Curve,” June 18, 2013, https\://oreil.ly/vAXJ5.  
92  
LEAN UX this either by diverting traffic from existing workflows or utilizing online  
advertising.  
Positive results from landing page tests are clear, but negative results can be  
difficult to interpret. If no one “converts,” it doesn’t necessarily mean your  
idea has no value. It could just mean that you’re not telling a compelling story.  
The good news is that landing page tests are cheap and can be iterated very  
quickly. If you think about it, Kickstarter \(and other crowdfunding sites\) are  
full of landing page MVPs, as demonstrated in Figure 12-3. The people who  
list products on those sites are looking for validation \(in the form of financial  
backing\) that they should invest in actually building their proposed ideas.  
Landing page tests don’t have to be pages. They can be advertisements or other  
online messages that have the components listed above.  
Figure 12-3. An example of a Kickstarter page  
CHAPTER 12\: BOX 8\: MVPS AND EXPERIMENTS  
93Feature Fake \(aka the Button to Nowhere\)  
Sometimes, the cost of implementing a feature is very high. In these cases, it is  
cheaper and faster to create the appearance of the feature where none actually  
exists. HTML buttons, calls to action, and other prompts and links provide the  
illusion to your customer that a feature exists. Upon clicking or tapping the  
link, the user is notified that the feature is “coming soon” and that they will be  
alerted when this has happened. Feature fakes are like mini-landing pages in  
that they exist to measure interest. They should be used sparingly and taken  
down as soon as a success threshold has been reached. If you feel they might  
negatively affect your relationship with your customer, you can make it right  
by offering a gift card or some other kind of compensation to those who found  
your mousetrap.  
Figure 12-4 shows a feature fake that Flickr used. In this case, they offered a  
button labeled “Use as screensaver” that was ostensibly meant for the user to  
specify a photo album as the screensaver for their device.  
Figure 12-4. An example of a feature fake found in Flickr’s Apple TV app  
94  
LEAN UX When users clicked the button, though, they were greeted by the screen shown  
in Figure 12-5. Flickr used this to gather evidence that a customer would like  
this feature. By measuring click rates, they could assess demand for this feature  
before they built it.  
Figure 12-5. The screen that appears after clicking the feature-fake button  
Figure 12-6 presents another feature-fake example. Here, MapMyRun offered  
the opportunity to take and upload photos while jogging using two modal  
overlays. No feature existed until they got an indication that a\) people wanted  
this feature and b\) how much they’d be willing to pay for it.  
CHAPTER 12\: BOX 8\: MVPS AND EXPERIMENTS  
95 Figure 12-6. Another example of a feature fake, this one on the MapMyRun website  
Wizard of Oz  
After you’ve proven demand for your idea, a Wizard of Oz MVP can help you  
to figure out the mechanics of your product. This type of MVP looks to the  
user like a fully functioning digital service. Behind the scenes, though, the data  
and communication with the initial set of users is handled manually by  
humans. For example, the team at Amazon behind the Echo ran a Wizard of  
Oz MVP as part of their initial testing to understand the types of queries peo-  
ple would ask and how quickly they would expect a response. In one room, a  
user would ask “Alexa” questions, and in another room, a human typed quer-  
ies into Google, got answers, and replied back. The test users were not aware  
that they were not using software. The rest of the team was able to observe  
users and understand how they would use this new product—before significant  
engineering effort had been invested.  
96  
LEAN UXExample\: Wizard of Oz MVP for Taproot Plus  
In 2014, our company worked with an organization called Taproot Founda-  
tion to create an online marketplace for pro bono volunteers. \(Pro bono is  
when a professional donates his skills to help a worthy cause. Unlike the  
unskilled volunteer services many of us participate in on the weekend, pro  
bono service involves using your professional talents in a volunteer context.\)  
Our client, Taproot Foundation, had been helping pro bono volunteers and  
nonprofit organizations find each other for years, but they had always deliv-  
ered this matching service “by hand,” through phone calls, emails, and in-  
person meetings. Now they wanted to bring that process online\: they wanted  
to create a website that would act as a two-sided marketplace for pro bono  
volunteers and the organizations that could benefit from their services.  
As we started the project, we faced a big set of questions\: how should the  
matching process work? Should the volunteers advertise their services? Should  
the organizations advertise their projects? What would work better? And after  
the parties found each other on the website, how should they get started with  
the project? How should the organizations communicate their needs? How  
should the volunteers scope the work? Even little details were big questions\:  
how should the parties schedule their first phone call?  
We decided this was a perfect time to create a Wizard of Oz MVP. We built a  
simple website, hand coding just the few static pages that we needed to make it  
look like we were open for business. We began with about a dozen pages in all\:  
one index page, and then a page for each of the 12 pilot projects we had lined  
up. Behind the scenes, we had a community manager assemble a list of poten-  
tial volunteers, and we emailed them, sending them a call to action and a link  
to our new site. To maintain the illusion that we had a running system, we  
made sure the email looked like it came from our new system, not from the  
community manager.  
When volunteers clicked the link in the email, they saw our Wizard of Oz site  
\(Figure 12-7\). When they used the site to apply for a volunteer opportunity, it  
looked to them like they were interacting with the system, but behind the  
scenes, it simply emailed the community manager and team. We tracked all of  
our interactions in a simple Trello board \(Figure 12-8\), which served as our  
“database.”  
CHAPTER 12\: BOX 8\: MVPS AND EXPERIMENTS  
97 Figure 12-7. The Wizard of Oz site for Taproot Foundation  
Figure 12-8. Our “database” was simply a Trello board  
We operated the system this way for a few months, gradually learning from  
our interactions, updating our business processes, and adding automation and  
other updates to the website as we learned. Eventually, we added a real func-  
tional backend, eliminating much of the “man behind the curtain” aspect of  
the site. We also updated the visual style, applying some mature graphic design  
polish \(Figure 12-9\)—after we had learned enough to understand how to com-  
municate our brand.  
98  
LEAN UX Figure 12-9. The Taproot Plus site with more polished graphic design  
By using a Wizard of Oz approach, we were able to pilot the high-risk parts of  
the design—the design of the business processes—learn as we went along, and  
eliminate the risk of spending lots of time and money designing and building  
the wrong thing.  
CHAPTER 12\: BOX 8\: MVPS AND EXPERIMENTS  
99 Prototyping  
One of the most effective ways to create MVPs is by prototyping the experi-  
ence. A prototype is an approximation of an experience that allows you to  
simulate what it is like to use the product or service in question. It needs to be  
usable on a variety of target devices. At the same time, your goal should be to  
spend as little effort as possible in creating the prototype. This makes your  
choice of prototyping technique important.  
Choosing which technique to use for your prototype depends on several  
factors\:  
• Who will be interacting with it  
• What you hope to learn  
• What you already know to be true  
• How much time you have to create it  
It’s critical to define the intended audience for your prototype. This allows you  
to create the smallest possible prototype that will generate meaningful feed-  
back from this audience. For example, if you’re using the prototype primarily  
to demo ideas to software engineers on your team, you can largely omit pri-  
mary areas of the product that aren’t being affected by the new experience—  
the global navigation, for example. Your developers know those items are  
there and that they’re not changing, so you don’t need to illustrate these items  
for them.  
Stakeholders, often less familiar with their own product than they’ll ever admit  
to, will likely need a greater level of fidelity in the prototype to truly grasp the  
concept. To meet the various needs of these disparate audiences, your proto-  
typing toolkit should be fairly broad. Let’s take a look at the different proto-  
typing techniques and consider when to use each.  
Paper Prototypes  
Made of the most accessible components—paper, pens, and tape—paper proto-  
types give you the ability to simulate experiences in a quick, crafty, fun way.  
No digital investment is necessary. Using tactics like flaps to show and hide dif-  
ferent states on a page or even creating a “window” for a slideshow of images  
to move through, you can begin to give the team a sense of how the product  
should function. You’ll be able to get an immediate sense of what is available  
in the experience and what is missing. Paper prototyping can give you a sense  
of how the workflow is starting to coalesce around the interface elements  
you’ve assembled. This method is especially helpful with touch interfaces that  
require the user to manipulate elements on a screen.  
100  
LEAN UX Pros  
• Can be created in an hour  
• Easily arranged and rearranged  
• Cheap and easy to throw away if you’re wrong  
• Can be assembled with materials already found in the office  
• Fun activity that many people enjoy  
Cons  
• Rapid iteration and duplication of the prototype can become time-  
consuming and tedious.  
• The simulation is very artificial, because you’re not using the actual input  
mechanisms \(mouse, trackpad, keyboard, touch screen, etc.\).  
• Feedback is limited to the high-level structure, information architecture,  
and flow of the product.  
• It is only useful with a limited audience.  
Low-Fidelity On-Screen Mock-Ups  
Creating a low-fidelity clickable on-screen experience—clickable wireframes,  
for example—lets you take a prototype to the next level of fidelity. Your  
investment in pixels provides a bit more realistic feel to the workflow. Test par-  
ticipants and team members use digital input mechanisms to interact with the  
prototype. This lets you get better insight and feedback about the way they  
will interact with the product at the level of the click, tap, or gesture.  
Pros  
• Provide a good sense of the length of workflow  
• Reveal major obstacles to primary task completion  
• Allow assessment of findability of core elements  
• Can be used to quickly wire up “something clickable” to get your team  
learning from your existing assets instead of forcing the creation of new  
ones  
CHAPTER 12\: BOX 8\: MVPS AND EXPERIMENTS  
101 Cons  
• Most people who will interact with these assets are savvy enough to recog-  
nize an unfinished product.  
• More attention than normal is paid to labeling and copy.  
Middle- and High-Fidelity On-Screen Prototypes  
Middle- and high-fidelity prototypes have significantly more detail than  
wireframe-based prototypes. You’ll use these to demonstrate and test designs  
that are fleshed out with a level of interaction, visual design, and content that  
is similar to \(or indistinguishable from\) the final product experience. The level  
of interactivity that you can create at this level varies from tool to tool; how-  
ever, most tools in this category will allow you to represent pixel-perfect simu-  
lations of the final experience. You will be able to create interface elements like  
form fields and drop-down menus that work, and form buttons that simulate  
submit actions. Some tools allow logical branching and basic data operations.  
Many allow some types of minor animations, transitions, and state changes.  
Pros  
• Produce prototypes that are high quality and realistic  
• Visual design and brand elements can be tested  
• Workflow and user interface interactions can be assessed  
Cons  
• Interactivity is still more limited than fully native prototypes.  
• Users typically can’t interact with real data, so there is a limit to the types  
of product interactions you can simulate.  
• Depending on the tool, it can be time-consuming to create and maintain  
these prototypes. It often creates duplicate effort to maintain a high-fidelity  
prototype and keep it in sync with the actual product.  
No-Code MVP  
It’s possible to produce a prototype of your product or service that is func-  
tional and yet bears no visual resemblance to the final product you have in  
mind. You do this by making what’s come to be called a No-Code MVP. No-  
Code MVPs rely on the vast array of tools like Airtable, Zapier, and Webflow  
that require no software development, but still allow you to wire together a  
102  
LEAN UX service that delivers functionality and, hopefully, some value to customers and  
end users.  
Pros  
• Provides a rapid way to test functionality before writing custom software  
• Helps you focus on the unique and differentiating parts of your service,  
without wasting time on building lots of infrastructure  
• Requires little to no software development skills  
Cons  
• Hard to represent brand, graphic design, and other finer points of the  
presentation  
• Hard to maintain over time  
• Cheap to get started but expensive to scale  
Coded and Live-Data Prototypes  
Coded prototypes offer up the highest level of fidelity for simulated experien-  
ces. For all intents and purposes, people interacting with this type of prototype  
should not be able to distinguish it from the final product unless they bump up  
against the limits of its scope \(i.e., they click a link to a page that was not pro-  
totyped\). Coded prototypes typically exist in the native environment \(the  
browser, the OS, on the device, etc.\) and make use of all of the expected inter-  
active elements. Buttons, drop-down menus, and form fields all function as the  
user would expect. They take input from the mouse, keyboard, and screen.  
They create as natural an interaction pattern as possible for the prototype’s  
evaluators.  
In terms of prototyping with data, there are two levels of fidelity here\: hardco-  
ded \(or static data\) and live data. The hardcoded prototypes look and function  
like the end product but don’t handle real data input, processing, or output.  
They are still just simulations and typically illustrate a few predefined scenar-  
ios. The live-data prototypes will connect with real data, process user input,  
and show appropriate data outputs. These are often deployed to real custom-  
ers and offer a level of realism to customers and insight into the customers’ use  
of the prototype that are not available from hardcoded prototypes. You also  
can use them when A/B testing \(that is, comparing two versions of a feature to  
see which performs better\) certain features or changes to the current workflow.  
CHAPTER 12\: BOX 8\: MVPS AND EXPERIMENTS  
103 Pros  
• Potential to reuse code for production  
• The most realistic simulation to create  
• Can be generated from existing code assets  
Cons  
• The team can become bogged down in debating the finer points of the  
prototype.  
• It’s time-consuming to create working code that delivers the desired  
experience.  
• It’s tempting to perfect the code before releasing to customers.  
• Updating and iterating can take a lot of time.  
What Should Go into My Prototype?  
You’ve picked the tool to create your MVP and are ready to begin. There is no  
need to prototype the entire product experience. Focus on the core workflows  
that let you test the biggest risks in your hypothesis.  
Focusing on the primary workflows when you create your MVP gives the team  
a sense of temporary tunnel vision \(in a good way!\), allowing them to focus on  
a specific portion of the experience and assess its validity and efficacy.  
Demos and Previews  
You might have developed your MVP with a focus on just one kind of user or  
just one segment of your customer base, but you can learn a lot by sharing  
your work with your colleagues. Test your prototyped MVP with your team-  
mates, stakeholders, and members of other teams. Take it to the lunch area  
and share it with some colleagues who work on different projects. Ensure that,  
internally, people are providing the team with insights into how well it works,  
how they’ll use it, and whether or not it’s worth investing in further. Let stake-  
holders click through it and give you their insights and thoughts.  
If your team has a demo day \(and if they don’t, they should\), bring the proto-  
type there to show progress on the project. The more exposure the MVP  
receives, the more insight you’ll have as to its validity. Next, take your proto-  
type to customers and potential customers. Let them click through the experi-  
ence and collect their feedback.  
104  
LEAN UXExample\: Using a Prototype MVP  
Let’s see how one team we recently worked with used a prototype MVP. In this  
case study, the team was considering making a significant change to their offer-  
ing. We used a prototype MVP to support the research and decision-making  
process.  
This established startup was struggling with their current product—an exclu-  
sive subscription-based community for group collaboration. It had been in  
market for a few years and had some initial traction, but adoption had reached  
a plateau—new users were not signing up. What’s more, the product was fac-  
ing growing competition. Realizing that a radical change was in order, the  
team considered revamping their business model and opening up the product  
to a significantly broader market segment. Their concern was two-fold\:  
1\. Would current users accept this change, given that it would alter the exclu-  
sive nature of the community?  
2\. Would the new market segment even be interested in this type of product?  
The team was worried that they could take a double hit. They feared that  
existing users would abandon the product and that there wouldn’t be enough  
new users coming on board to make up for the shortfall.  
We worked with the team to define our plan as a hypothesis. We laid out the  
new market segment and defined the core set of functionality that we wanted  
to offer to them. This was a subset of the ultimate vision, but it could be  
demonstrated in five wireframes.  
We spent a week creating the wireframes to ensure that our developers, mar-  
keters, and executives were committed to the new direction. We showed the  
wireframes to current customers, getting two rounds of customer feedback  
over the course of these five days, and we ended up with a clickable prototype  
—our MVP.  
The timing for our experiment was fortuitous\: there was a conference full of  
potential customers scheduled for the following week in Texas. The team went  
to the conference and walked the halls of the convention center with the proto-  
type on our iPads.  
The mock-ups worked great on the iPads\: customers tapped, swiped, and chat-  
ted with us about the new offering. Three days later, we returned to New York  
City with feedback written on every sticky note and scrap of paper we could  
find.  
CHAPTER 12\: BOX 8\: MVPS AND EXPERIMENTS  
105 We sorted the notes into groups, and some clear themes emerged. Customer  
feedback let us conclude that although there was merit to this new business  
plan, we would need further differentiation from existing products in the mar-  
ketplace if we were going to succeed.  
All told, we spent eight business days developing our hypotheses, creating our  
MVP, and getting market feedback. This put us in a great position to pivot our  
position and refine the product to fit our market segment more effectively.

# Bringing It All Together  
In this section, we’ve laid out all of the major techniques in Lean UX, from  
framing your work as a business problem statement to defining success in  
terms of outcomes for both the business and the user. We’ve shown you how to  
capture the essence of what you know about your users as proto-personas.  
We’ve talked about how to get started figuring out your solutions. And we’ve  
shared ways to write and test your hypotheses. The Lean UX Canvas gives you  
a concise, single-page way to organize your work as you apply these techni-  
ques in the real world.  
That said, the real world is a messy place, and every project you work on will  
be messy in its own way. \(That’s one of the reasons to use the canvas in the  
first place!\) To wrap up this section, we thought we’d share some stories of  
teams using Lean UX in this very messy real world. You’ll see how well Lean  
UX works—in fact, how well-suited it is to addressing the messiness of the real  
world.  
In these stories, you’ll see that some of these teams used the canvas. Others just  
used some of the Lean UX techniques that are embedded in the canvas,  
without using the canvas itself to organize their work. As we’ve said before,  
this is fine. Take these tools and make them your own. We hope these stories  
will give you some ideas and inspiration for how to do just that.  
# The Lean UX Canvas in the Enterprise  
Recently we heard from a product and design leader at a large enterprise soft-  
ware company in Silicon Valley. This company develops a cloud computing  
platform to help companies manage digital workflows for enterprise opera-  
tions. They got in touch because they wanted to tell us how they’d been using  
107 the Lean UX canvas to kick off projects and new initiatives. We thought it was  
a great story to share.  
A team at this company was working on the second release of a product that  
had received good feedback from customers. The product had a novel way of  
displaying data—a display that was really beautiful, that tested well, and that  
generated really positive feedback from customers. The product used an  
unusual UI element\: a custom-built map that helped users visualize work pro-  
cesses and spot opportunities for process improvements.  
In addition to generating positive feedback from customers, this UI showed  
really well internally. Stakeholders loved it and supported the idea of enhanc-  
ing it. So it seemed like a natural choice to build on the success of this feature  
in the next version, and, in fact, that’s what the team planned to do\: they were  
going to really lean into this feature for the second release.  
Still, they had recently come across the Lean UX Canvas as a tool and liked the  
way that it spurred methodical thinking about the work they needed to do.  
They decided to work through a Lean UX Canvas for this initiative. When  
they did, an interesting thing happened. When they came to Chapter 8, they  
had a breakthrough.  
In order to complete Box 4, the team had to turn back to the feedback data  
that they had already collected from customers. This often happens when you  
work on a Lean UX Canvas\: you have to find the information that you need to  
complete a section. Sometimes that means you need to do additional research,  
and sometimes it simply means you have to review the research you’ve already  
done.  
In this case, as the team reviewed their data, they noticed an important pattern  
in the user feedback they’d overlooked\: customers were telling them they loved  
the map, but they wanted more from the product than simply data display.  
They wanted the product to be more proactive. They were saying essentially,  
“The display is really beautiful, but we want you to highlight where we should  
be paying attention.”  
The process of completing a Lean UX Canvas forced the team to stop and  
methodically examine the data they had collected. One team member told me,  
“We actually had the feedback. We just weren’t listening to it!” He continued\:  
“When we used the canvas to go through the data about what was materially  
important to our customers, we realized that we had simply been ignoring the  
data!”  
So the team spent time interpreting this feedback. They really dug in and  
worked out what they thought the feedback meant and what it meant about  
the outcomes customers were seeking. When they went back to the customers  
to validate these ideas, customers responded positively.  
108  
LEAN UX After that, the team made an easy decision\: they needed to change their priori-  
ties. One team member told us that the conversation on the team was clear.  
“When the voting came down, it wasn’t ‘make the map better’; it was ‘let’s do  
what our customers really find valuable.’”  
In the pilot for the second release, “we got really high marks from our custom-  
ers.” Those high marks helped the team get to broad release even faster. “We  
probably got there six months sooner because of this feedback.”  
# Validately\: Validating Your Product with Customer  
# Interviews and a Two-Day Prototype  
Serial entrepreneur Steven Cohn got the idea to launch Validately because of  
the challenges he faced as an entrepreneur doing his own user research. When  
he surveyed the landscape, he discovered that other user researchers had simi-  
lar challenges. User researchers were typically using free tools like Skype and  
Google Docs to conduct their studies. He knew that these tools weren’t  
designed for user research and made the process inefficient. Some teams sup-  
plemented these tools with the best-known service provider in the space, user-  
testing.com. He knew that there was an opportunity here.  
Steven and his team used customer interviews to discover this user’s needs and  
goals \(Box 4 of the Lean UX Canvas\). In these conversations, they discovered  
where they should focus when they asked researchers what they do with the  
results their studies generated. “That’s where the bulk of my work is,” they  
told him. In fact, he learned that the bulk of researchers’ work began once the  
actual research was over.  
The Validately team learned that, following a round of customer interviews or  
usability tests, researchers had to go back to a lengthy and disorganized Goo-  
gle Doc of notes and connect those notes to timestamps in the video of the  
study. They would use these timestamps \(and some kind of video editing tool\)  
to create video clips, assemble these clips into a highlight reel, and finally share  
that reel with their teams, clients, and stakeholders. All this just to share what  
they learned during the study.  
The team conducted dozens of interviews to validate this problem. They  
learned that this work—creating reports and video highlights—was frequently  
more than 50% of the total effort devoted to each study. He knew he’d found  
a problem worth solving.  
The next step was to work on the solution. \(Box 5 of the Lean UX Canvas.\)  
Steven and team created a prototype in InVision that hypothesized what a  
streamlined tool that combined note taking, time tracking, and report and  
highlight reel creation could look like. They spent two days creating this proto-  
type before showing it to customers.  
CHAPTER 13\: BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER  
109 The prototype almost single-handedly answered the question “How are you  
better than usertesting.com?” Once potential customers saw the value of the  
streamlined tool Validately wanted to build, they were immediately interested.  
At this point, Steven and team asked for one more type of “feedback.” They  
asked people to commit on the spot—to purchasing a product not in the future  
but right now, even though it wasn’t ready for delivery. The contract offered a  
cancelation clause if delivery didn’t happen, but otherwise, Steven used the  
prototype as a selling tool for a service that did not yet exist. The pitch  
worked, which helped Validately validate that their solution was the right one.  
They converted enough customers to build a thriving business in the gaps  
between free tools like Google Docs and Skype. Validately went on to be a  
huge success, ultimately selling to UserZoom in 2019.  
The MVPs they used here—customer conversation followed by a two-day pro-  
totype—helped Steven and team gather three levels of validation\:  
Time  
Will people give us 30 minutes of their time to discuss this problem? If not,  
the problem we’re solving is not important enough to them and likely not  
a space we want to play in.  
Social  
Will the people we speak with take it to their boss, team, infosec, procure-  
ment, and others in the organization? Will they socialize it and endorse it  
internally? To understand this, they always asked, “Will you introduce me  
to others in the organization who might be interested in this tool?” Again,  
if this resulted in no introductions, that was also a signal.  
Money  
If the prospective customer gave their time and their reputation, they’d be  
asked to purchase. This is the ultimate validation as it actually resulted in  
a sale.  
# Kaplan Test Prep\: Using Lean UX to Launch  
# a New Business  
Kaplan Test Prep has been helping students in the US prepare for standardized  
tests like college and medical school entrance exams since 1938. Now, with  
education transforming on a nearly annual basis, Kaplan has to continuously  
reinvent how it delivers value to its customers. Lee Weiss, currently a senior  
vice president at the company, has helped Kaplan do exactly this for more than  
20 years. Most recently, in the fall of 2018, Lee started thinking about a new  
idea to reinvent Kaplan’s university partnerships business. He wanted to make  
it possible for universities to create online courses for high school students on  
the topics of college and career readiness.  
110  
LEAN UX Their idea was to create a safe way for high school students to learn about var-  
ious career paths and try out different universities at the same time. Lee and  
his colleagues spent a few weeks sketching out some ideas of how this could  
work and put their thoughts down in a PowerPoint deck. This deck became  
their first experiment—their MVP—to help them test their first hypothesis\: that  
leadership would be interested in their plans.  
In early 2019, they met with the leadership team to test their idea. Kaplan’s  
leaders were excited about this new idea and gave Lee and his colleague Liz  
Laub the green light to focus solely on this new idea. Kaplan’s leadership team  
told Lee and Liz, “Take the next 90 days and see if you can get this concept off  
the ground.”  
Lee and Liz started by asking themselves the first key question of Lean UX\:  
What’s the most important thing we need to learn first? \(Box 7 on the Lean  
UX Canvas.\)  
They realized they wouldn’t have a business at all if they couldn’t get any uni-  
versities interested. With their biggest risk identified, they were able to move  
on to the second key Lean UX question\: What’s the least amount of work we  
need to do to learn it? \(Box 8 on the Lean UX Canvas.\)  
They started talking to universities to see if they’d be interested in partnering  
with them on this initiative—even though the initiative itself did not yet exist.  
Within 90 days, the team had spoken to 20 different universities and ended up  
with 2 of the biggest universities in the US interested in the idea—all through  
simple, and at times serendipitous, conversation. This was great news, as it  
would give Lee and Liz enough information to make a more detailed request  
from leadership. A request for budget to bring a product to market.  
Before they could do that, though, there were other questions they’d need to  
answer\: like what would students and parents want? What would their solu-  
tion look like? \(These are the kinds of questions you capture in Box 7 of the  
canvas.\)  
This is where the obstacles started to appear\: their assumptions about their  
product offering \(Chapter 9\) started getting smashed on the rocks of reality.  
Initially, they’d hoped to build a product that allowed teachers and students to  
interact together in real time. Unfortunately, time zones got in the way of that,  
something they learned quickly through early and continuous conversations  
with students. So they pivoted to asynchronous courses and quickly faced a  
new challenge\: how to build an engaging and high-value course.  
They assumed that the best way to do this would be to build cohort-based  
communities. They tested their assumptions by starting to create early versions  
of this offering. While this received strong positive feedback from the students  
who were involved in the tests, there was still demand from both parents and  
CHAPTER 13\: BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER  
111 students for live mentoring and support. They addressed this by hiring former  
students from these universities as mentors. These pieces were the foundations  
of a product that met both synchronous and asynchronous needs.  
There was one last piece of the puzzle they had to explore in their initial 90-  
day period, though\: their hypotheses about the kind of organization they  
would need to build and support this business. It wouldn’t do them any good  
to solve this need in the market with a compelling product if they couldn’t cre-  
ate a viable, sustainable business. \(These service-design considerations should  
be part of your solution definition in Box 5.\)  
Here again the team made a series of assumptions about who they’d need to  
hire, how they should price the product, how much it would cost to run it,  
and, of course, what shape the product should take. Lee notes that nearly all of  
these assumptions were wrong in hindsight, but they now had enough infor-  
mation to go back to leadership with a more detailed request\: a request for  
budget—\$700,000 to be exact—to get the product built and to market. The  
request was approved, with one caveat\: you have one year to break even.  
The team got started. Using nothing more than conversations with students,  
teachers, and administrators at their two \(now signed\) customers, the team cre-  
ated an initial curriculum of three courses. The goal was to make the highest  
quality courses they could as quickly as possible.  
With the curriculum in place, the team needed operational systems to support  
the work—CRM, learning management systems, content management systems,  
etc. They sought systems with the mandate to use whatever got them up and  
running the fastest. They stitched together a lightweight experience using SaaS  
products—all outside the Kaplan tech ecosystem, which would have slowed  
down their ability to run quick tests. \(This is a great use of the No-Code MVP  
technique.\)  
The first two-week course had eight students in it, all of whom got the course  
for free. All eight finished the course and gave strong positive feedback about  
the product quality and overall experience. Now it was time to acquire the first  
paid cohort. There wasn’t a lot of interest at first. Lee, Liz, and the team were  
starting to worry. Their application was long, the cost was high, and the \$50  
application fee they’d seen elsewhere and copied into their product all seemed  
to be keeping potential customers from submitting their applications.  
The next experiments were clear to the team—remove the application fee,  
shorten the application process, and lower the price. They were able to do this  
for two reasons. First, because they were an internal innovation team, they had  
decision-making authority to explore pricing. So they cut their prices in half.  
The second reason that they could experiment like this? They were working in  
112  
LEAN UX one-week sprints. So even if a decision was catastrophic, the longest they had  
to live with it was one week.  
The team didn’t have to wait long, though. The day they made the changes,  
they got more applications than the prior two weeks combined. Sales revenue  
quintupled. As the product saw stronger traction, the team began to worry  
about maintaining product quality as they scaled. They defined a set of  
outcome-based metrics to guide their decision making and keep quality high\:  
they wanted to make sure that every student logged in within 48 hours of any  
course starting, they wanted to see an 80% course completion rate, and they  
wanted to maintain a Net Promoter Score \(NPS\) of 50.  
By using outcomes as their north stars, evidence-based decision making as their  
engine, and short cycles to keep themselves on track, the team has managed to  
build a business unit that now employs more than 30. They proved that fol-  
lowing data and instinct and slowly scaling up decisions allows you to make  
the best course corrections along the way. When you couple this data with an  
autonomous team and a clear, outcome-based mandate, the results speak for  
themselves.  
CHAPTER 13\: BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER  
113 PART III  
# COLLABORATION  
It’s Tuesday, and Rick, Mark, Olga, and Arti are standing at the whiteboard,  
looking at a wireframe that they’ve drawn. Arti, the designer, has a marker in  
her hand, but she’s not drawing. “Rick, I don’t understand what you’re driving  
at. Can you explain the problem?” she asks.  
Rick takes the marker, wipes clear a section of the board, and explains the reg-  
ulation, again. The team is designing an app for stock traders, and the app  
must obey a strict set of regulations. Rick, the business analyst, is responsible  
for making sure that the team’s designs support the rules.  
After a while, the team is nodding, and Arti takes the marker again. She sug-  
gests a change to the wireframe design of the app on the board, and the team  
nods again. They all take out their iPhones, take photos of the board, and  
agree to reconvene the next day. They’re confident that what they’ve agreed on  
will be ready for user testing on Thursday.  
Arti goes back to her desk to begin detailing out the design they’ve sketched.  
Mark, the frontend developer, begins building the page—he uses components  
from the Design System the team has built, so he doesn’t need to wait for Arti  
before getting the basic pieces in place. Rick opens the project’s wiki page and  
begins to document the decisions the team has made about the application’s  
behavior. He’ll review these choices with the product owner later in the day.  
115 And Olga, the QA tester, begins the process of writing tests for the new section  
of the app.  
This is the day-to-day rhythm of Lean UX\: a team working collaboratively,  
iteratively, and in parallel, with few handoffs, minimal deliverables, and a  
focus on working software and market feedback. In this section, you’ll see how  
it’s done.  
# About Part III  
In the previous part, we looked at the ideas behind Lean UX—the principles  
that drive the work. In this section, we get very practical and describe in detail  
the process of doing Lean UX.  
# The Lean UX Process  
Chapter 14, Collaborative Design, is about one of the major elements of Lean  
UX—the way it encourages cross-functional collaboration. It encourages  
designers to work with their nondesign colleagues to create the best possible  
products. This chapter will talk about some of the most important ways that  
we do that.  
Chapter 15, Feedback and Research, is about how Lean UX advocates contin-  
uous research and collaborative research. This can feel like a change for a lot  
of teams, so we discuss some of the key things you’ll need to know here.  
Chapter 16, Integrating Lean UX and Agile, is all about how Lean UX and  
Agile methods work together. Agile is one of the foundational pillars of Lean  
UX. Lean UX was born from a need to work with Agile software development  
teams—a struggle many designers face on a daily basis. This chapter will help  
you navigate.

# Collaborative Design  
Be open to collaboration. Other people and other people’s ideas are often  
better than your own. Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you,  
spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life.  
Amy Poehler  
What is a “user experience”? It’s the sum total of all of the interactions a user  
has with your product and service. It’s created by all of the decisions that you  
and your team make about your product or service\: the way you price it, the  
way you package and sell it, the way you onboard users, the way you support  
it and maintain it and upgrade it, and so on and so on. In other words, it’s cre-  
ated by a team, not an individual designer. For this reason, Lean UX begins  
with the idea that user experience design should be a collaborative process.  
Lean UX brings designers and nondesigners together in cocreation. It yields  
ideas that are bigger and better than their individual contributors. To be clear,  
though, we’re not advocating “design by committee,” a phrase that implies a  
process filled with bad compromises and uninformed decision making. Instead,  
Lean UX processes are orchestrated and facilitated by designers and executed  
by discipline specialists working from a common playbook. Lean UX increases  
your team’s ownership over the work by providing an opportunity for individ-  
ual points of view to be shared early and continuously through the process.  
Ultimately, it’s about using the diverse expertise of your team to create designs  
that work.  
In this chapter we’ll explore the many benefits that come from this close, cross-  
functional collaboration.  
Let’s dig in...  
117 Collaborative Design  
In Chapter 10, you learned about hypotheses. To test your hypotheses, you  
sometimes simply conduct research \(described in Chapter 12\). But other times,  
you need to design and build something that will help you to test these hypoth-  
eses. For example, if you’re in the early stage of a project, you might test  
demand by creating a landing page that will measure how many customers  
sign up for your service. Or if you’re later in the product life cycle, you might  
be working at the feature level—adding some new functionality that will make  
users more productive, for example. Navigating the many possible design  
options for these features can be difficult for teams. How often have you expe-  
rienced team conflict over design choices?  
The most effective way we’ve found to rally a team around a design direction  
is through collaboration. Over the long haul, collaboration yields better results  
than hero-based design \(the practice of calling in a designer or design team to  
drop in, come up with something beautiful, and take off to rescue the next  
project\). Teams rarely learn or get better from working with heroes. Instead, in  
the same way that creating hypotheses together increases the product IQ of the  
team, designing together increases the design IQ of the team. It allows all of  
the members of the team to articulate their ideas. It gives designers a much  
broader set of ideas to draw upon as they refine the design. This, in turn,  
increases the entire team’s feelings of ownership in the work. Finally, collabo-  
rative design builds team-wide shared understanding. It is this shared under-  
standing that is the currency of Lean UX. The more the team collectively  
understands, the less it has to document in order to move forward.  
Collaborative design is an approach that allows a team to design together. It  
helps teams build a shared understanding of both the design problem and the  
solution. It provides the means for them to work together to decide which  
functionality and interface elements best implement the feature they want to  
create.  
Collaborative design is still a designer-led activity. It’s the designer’s responsi-  
bility to not only call collaborative design meetings but facilitate them as well.  
Sometimes, you’ll have informal chats and sketching sessions. Sometimes,  
more structured one-on-one sessions with a developer at a whiteboard. Other  
times, you will gather the entire team for a Design Studio exercise or even a  
Design Sprint. The key is to collaborate with a diverse group of team members.  
118  
LEAN UX In a typical collaborative design session, teams sketch together, critique the  
work as it emerges, and ultimately converge on a solution they feel has the  
greatest chance of success. The designer, while still producing designs, takes on  
the additional role of facilitator to lead the team through a series of exercises.  
The output of these sessions typically consists of low-fidelity sketches and  
wireframes. This level of fidelity is important. First, it makes it possible for  
everyone to contribute, even team members with less sophisticated drawing  
skills. Second, it’s critical to maintaining the malleability of the work. This  
gives the team the ability to pivot quickly if their tests reveal that the approach  
isn’t working. It’s much easier to pivot from a failed approach if you haven’t  
spent too much time laboriously drawing, documenting, and detailing that  
approach.  
Collaborative Design\: The Informal Approach  
A few years ago, Jeff was designing a dashboard for a web app targeted at  
TheLadders’ recruiter and employer audience. There was a lot of information  
to fit on one screen, and he was struggling to make it all work. Instead of  
burning too much time at his desk pushing pixels, he grabbed a whiteboard  
and asked Greg, the lead developer, to join him. Jeff sketched his original idea  
about how to lay out all of the content and functionality for this dashboard  
\(see Figure 14-1\). The two of them then discussed the idea, and eventually Jeff  
handed Greg the marker. He sketched his ideas on the same whiteboard. They  
went back and forth, ultimately converging on a layout and flow they felt was  
both usable and feasible, given that they needed to deliver a solution within the  
current two-week sprint. At the end of that two-hour session, they returned to  
their desks and began working. Jeff refined the sketch into a more formal wire-  
frame and workflow, while Greg began to write the infrastructure code neces-  
sary to get the data they needed to the presentation layer.  
CHAPTER 14\: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN  
119 Figure 14-1. Examples of whiteboard sketches  
120  
LEAN UX They had built a shared understanding through their collaborative design ses-  
sion. They both knew what they were going to build and what the feature  
needed to do. They didn’t need to wait to document it. This allowed them to  
get the first version of this idea built within a two-week time frame.  
Conversation\: Your Most Powerful Tool  
Lean UX promotes conversation as the primary means of communication among team  
members. In this way, it is very much in line with the Agile Manifesto, which promotes  
“individuals and interactions over processes and tools.” Conversation unites a team  
around a shared vision. It also brings insights from different disciplines to the project  
much earlier than a traditional design cycle would allow. As new ideas are formed or  
changes are made to the design, a team member’s insight can quickly challenge those  
changes in a way the designer alone wouldn’t have recognized.  
By having these conversations early and often, the team is aware of everyone’s ideas  
and can get started on their own work earlier. If they know that the proposed solution  
requires a certain backend infrastructure, for example, the team’s engineers can get  
started on that work while the design is refined and finalized. Parallel paths for soft-  
ware development and design are the fastest route to reach an actual experience.  
These conversations might seem awkward at first; after all, you’re breaking down time-  
tested walls between disciplines. As the conversation evolves, however, designers pro-  
vide developers with input on the implementation of certain features, ensuring the  
proper evolution of their vision. These conversations promote transparency of process  
and progress. This transparency builds a common language and deeper bonds  
between team members. Teammates who trust one another are more motivated to  
work together to produce higher-quality work.  
Find ways to have more conversations with your teammates, both work-related and  
not. Time spent cultivating social ties with your team—eating meals together, for  
example—can make work-related conversations easier, more honest, and more  
productive.  
Lean UX and Design Sprints  
In Chapter 9, we wrote about an exercise called “Design Studio.” This is a  
great way to gather a team for a structured design session. In recent years, a  
similar approach called “Design Sprint” has become popular. Described in the  
book Sprint by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, and Braden Kowitz \(Simon and  
Schuster\), a design sprint is a five-day process that gathers a team, defines a  
question, develops ideas, builds a prototype, and tests it—all in a single week.  
Design Sprints are like a Design Studio on steroids. Or like a mini-cycle of  
Lean UX work. Having now facilitated a few of our own, we’ve seen how  
CHAPTER 14\: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN  
121 powerful this process can be. If you’re looking to kick-start a team, a project,  
or an initiative, a Design Sprint is a great way to go.1  
That said, there are some perhaps contradictory parts of the methods. Lean  
UX has a particular way to frame problems, for example. Design Sprints frame  
problems on day one using a different method. Lean UX recommends hypothe-  
ses, experiments, and MVPs to test your ideas. Design Sprints take teams  
through prototyping and testing during the final days of the sprint in a way  
that doesn’t use hypotheses or the word MVP. So sometimes it feels like the  
methods are in conflict.  
Our perspective is that the methods are deeply compatible in spirit, if not in  
exact practice. If you can embrace the spirit of the methods, Design Sprints fit  
really well into a Lean UX approach.  
That said, we wanted to learn a little more, so we reached out to Jake Knapp  
to talk through some of our questions.  
Lean UX and Design Sprints\: A Conversation with Jeff, Josh,  
and Jake Knapp  
Q\: Lots of people have questions about how Lean UX and Design Sprints work  
together. Do you have POV on this question?  
Jake Knapp\: To me, Lean UX is like a cookbook you can use across your entire product  
cycle and throughout your entire organization. Design Sprints are a single recipe—  
something very specific for a specific moment with a specific part of your team. The  
philosophies are totally compatible. Anyone who is familiar with Lean UX should check  
out Design Sprints, and vice versa.  
Q\: How much flexibility is there in the Design Sprint recipe? Can we adjust the recipe?  
JK\: Yes…but don’t adjust the recipe until you’ve tried the original. The steps are in  
there for a reason, and they work, but if you’ve run Design Sprints by the book a few  
times and you think you need an adjustment, try it!  
Q\: That’s great to hear—because that’s how we recommend people think about Lean  
UX. It’s always a matter of trying things, learning, and adjusting based on what you’ve  
learned.  
JK\: That’s right. Observe what happens and take notes. Treat it like an experiment  
within the experiment. And if you find an improvement, please let me know.  
Q\: What are Design Sprints really great at? What are they not great for?  
1 The word “sprint” can be confusing here. In this context, we’re not talking about an Agile-style  
sprint, what Scrum would call an “iteration.” When we use the phrase “Design Sprint,” we’ll use  
capital letters to indicate that we’re talking about the specific process described in the book  
Sprint.  
122  
LEAN UX JK\: Design Sprints are great for teams who want to build something new or shake  
things up. They’re ideal for starting big projects and improving your hunch about prod-  
uct/market fit. They’re great for building momentum and alignment on a team…in  
other words, a Design Sprint gets everybody rowing in the same direction with a real  
purpose. They’re also great at resetting team culture and encouraging the best kind of  
risk-taking and decision making. They can bring people a better understanding of and  
focus on their customers, and they can bring people closer to their colleagues. They  
can bring a renewed sense of joy in work, because you finally get to cut through all the  
baloney and just do what matters most.  
Q\: OK, now the other side of that question\: What are they NOT great for?  
JK\: Design Sprints are NOT meant for designing every detail of your product or plan-  
ning out your entire development schedule. They don’t replace your MVP, and they  
don’t offer you a path from zero to launch. They’re really good at this one specific  
moment—in fact, I can confidently say they are the best way I know of to start a new  
project. Before and after that moment…well, refer to the rest of the book you’re  
holding. \:\)  
Q\: There seems to be a lot of overlap between the methods. Which one should we do?  
JK\: Both!  
Using Design Sprints in a Lean UX Process  
So, as you can see from our conversation with Jake, we all believe the methods  
work well together. So, then, what is the best way to use Lean UX to set up a  
successful Design Sprint? And how can you use Lean UX after you’ve run a  
Design Sprint?  
Here’s what we recommend\:  
• Remember that Lean UX encourages you to reframe your work as a prob-  
lem to solve rather than a “thing to build.” Don’t go into a sprint thinking,  
“What can we build?” Instead, use your sprint to figure out “How can we  
solve our problem?”  
• Lean UX encourages you to articulate your assumptions about the prob-  
lem, the target audience, potential solutions, and what success looks like.  
This allows you to frame hypotheses, which can be a great way to frame a  
design sprint.  
• Use your hypothesis\(es\) as input to your Design Sprint.  
• Use the work you do in the sprint to start to tear apart these assumptions,  
test them, and come out the other end with a better set of hypotheses and  
a clear set of next steps.  
CHAPTER 14\: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN  
123 • This next set of hypotheses can be used as input to your next cycle of Lean  
UX work.  
# Design Systems  
As the story of Jeff and Greg at the whiteboard makes clear, collaborative  
design is most effective when you’re working with what we think of as a fat  
pen. Design Sprints are another technique that embraces this fat-pen way of  
working. You’re sketching together, making high-level decisions about concept,  
structure, flow, and functionality. This is the level of resolution and detail that  
is most appropriate for collaborative design. Collaborative design almost never  
means that teams are sitting together at a workstation moving pixels around.  
In fact, this kind of group hovering at the pixel level is what most designers  
would consider their worst nightmare. \(To be clear\: don’t do this.\)  
And yet, design isn’t done when the sketch is done. It’s not completed on the  
whiteboard. Instead, it’s usually just getting started. So how do we get design  
to the pixel level? How do we get to finished visual design?  
Increasingly, we’re seeing teams turn to design systems. Design systems are like  
style guides on steroids. When we wrote the first edition of this book, design  
systems were a new thing. In fact, as an industry, we hadn’t really decided yet  
what to call them. Back then, we were excited about design systems because  
they promised to unlock collaboration between designers and developers, and  
to solve once many of the repetitive and rote problems that designers faced,  
which meant that designers could move on to the tougher challenges that  
added more value.  
By the time we wrote the second edition of this book, four years later, design  
systems had gone mainstream. Forward-thinking large organizations had built  
or were building their enterprise-scale systems. Startups were putting them in  
place from day one. Consulting organizations that specialized in design sys-  
tems had sprung up. Conferences were bringing practitioners together. We had  
many more examples that we could feature in the second edition of the book,  
and we’ve left them in place for your reference.  
Fast-forward to today. Design systems are now a well-established part of the  
way design gets done in our industry. They continue to deliver on the promise  
of the early days—including the benefits we were so excited about when we  
first encountered them\: they continue to allow product teams to work in col-  
laborative and highly agile ways. Before we get into some of the ways that  
design systems help teams be more agile, let’s take a look at what they are.  
124  
LEAN UXDesign Systems\: What’s in a Name?  
Style guides. Pattern libraries. Brand guidelines. Asset libraries. Design systems.  
There’s not a lot of common language in this part of the design world, so let’s  
take a moment to clarify our terms.  
For years, large organizations created brand guidelines \(Figure 14-2\)—compre-  
hensive documents of brand design and usage rules for those companies. In  
predigital days, these guidelines were documents, sometimes a few pages, but  
frequently large, comprehensive bound volumes. As the world moved online,  
these books sometimes moved onto the web as PDF documents, web pages, or  
even wikis.  
Figure 14-2. Example of brand standards guidelines, this one from NASA2  
At the same time, publishers and publications often maintained style guides  
that covered rules of writing and content presentation. College students in the  
United States are familiar with the comforting strictness of The Chicago Man-  
ual of Style, The MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing, and  
others.  
The computing world’s version of a style guide is exemplified by Apple’s  
famous Human Interface Guidelines \(HIG\). The HIG is a comprehensive  
2 NASA, “NASA Graphics Standards Manual,” September 8, 2015, https\://oreil.ly/nCc4H.  
CHAPTER 14\: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN  
125 document that explains every component in Apple’s operating system, provides  
rules for using the components, and contains examples that demonstrate  
proper use of the components.  
Finally, developers are familiar with asset libraries. These collections of reusa-  
ble code elements are intended to make the developer’s job easier by providing  
tested, reusable code that’s easy to download from an always current code  
repository.  
As with many ideas in the digital world, digital design systems \(which we’ll call  
design systems for the sake of brevity\) are a kind of mash-up of all of these  
ideas. A good design system contains comprehensive documentation of the ele-  
ments of a design, rules and examples that govern the use of these elements,  
and, crucially, the code and other assets that actually implement the design.  
In practice, a design system functions as a single source of truth for the presen-  
tation layer of a product. Teams can sketch at the whiteboard and then quickly  
use the elements found in the design system to assemble a prototype or  
production-ready frontend.  
The Value of Design Systems  
Design systems are a powerful enabler of Lean UX. They allow the visual and  
microinteraction details of a design to be developed and maintained in parallel  
with the other decisions a team makes. So decisions like screen structure, pro-  
cess flow, information hierarchy—things that can be worked out at the white-  
board—can be handled by the right group of teammates, whereas things like  
color, type, and spacing can be handled by another \(very likely overlapping\)  
group of folks.  
This has a couple of big benefits for teams\:  
Design faster  
The team isn’t reinventing the wheel every time they design a screen.  
Prototype faster  
Frontend developers are working from a kit of parts—they don’t need to  
recreate the elements of a solution each time; they can just go get the  
appropriate pieces out of the design system.  
It also has some big benefits for organizations\:  
Increased consistency  
A good design system is easy for developers to use. So they are more likely  
to use parts that they find in the design system and less likely to “roll their  
own.” This means a greater likelihood that their work will adhere to brand  
standards.  
126  
LEAN UX Increased quality  
By centralizing the design and creation of user-facing elements, you can  
take advantage of the work of a few highly trained and highly specialized  
designers and UI developers. Their high-quality work can be implemented  
by other less-specialized developers in the organization to produce top-  
notch results.  
Lower costs  
A good design system is not free. It requires investment to build it and staff  
to maintain it. But over time, it pays for itself by providing tools and  
frameworks that make the users of the system—the other developers in the  
organization—more efficient and more productive. It allows new designers  
to come up to speed more quickly, for example, because it documents all  
of the frontend conventions used in an app. Similarly, it allows new devel-  
opers to come up to speed more quickly, because the basic building blocks  
of their work are available in an easy-to-use framework.  
Design Systems Teams Are Product Teams  
Make no mistake\: a design systems team is a product team. Though this team  
is working on a product that will be used \(in most cases\) by internal users, this  
team is nevertheless a product team. It will have many of the same concerns  
that any product team will have\: first and foremost, it needs to make a product  
that its users find valuable. As with any internal product, your measure of suc-  
cess is not sales; it’s adoption. So understanding the needs of your users and  
serving them will be key to rapid adoption of your work and, ultimately, key  
to your success.  
Design systems teams can approach this challenge using Lean UX methods.  
Some methods, like certain kinds of experimentation, can be difficult or impos-  
sible for design systems teams\: because design systems are platform products,  
they will be used by teams in a variety of contexts and must integrate into a  
wide range of environments. So compatibility and stability concerns can limit  
the kinds of experiments you run.  
That said, because the users of design systems are internal, you should have an  
easy time getting access to them. This means that design systems teams can  
lean into the techniques of collaborative design, using workshops, sprints, and  
shared whiteboard sessions to build collaboration and shared understanding  
between design systems developers and users.  
CHAPTER 14\: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN  
127Don’t Skip the Fat Markers  
One surprising concern that we’ve seen as design systems become more ubiqui-  
tous is that design systems can be so good and so easy to use that designers can  
be tempted to skip right past the “fat marker” stage of design and go right to  
high-fidelity work. When this happens, artifacts that represent early-stage  
thinking—the concept development stage of the work—can sometimes be mis-  
understood by stakeholders, colleagues, and even the designers themselves. It’s  
human nature to respond to high-fidelity mock-ups in a different way than you  
respond to low-fidelity mock-ups. When you show people, especially nonde-  
signers, a high-fidelity mock-up, you tend to get feedback on the details. The  
fonts, colors, and content. But when you show people a paper-and-pencil  
sketch, there are no details to comment on. Instead, people read these draw-  
ings as concept drawings, and they respond to that.  
So, for designers, it’s important not to get seduced by how easy it is to just  
whip out Figma, grab the components in your design system, and produce a  
credible mock-up. Don’t do it. Start with your fat markers.  
For design systems teams, though, there’s an opportunity to help users choose  
the right tool for the job. When we wrote the first edition of this book, design-  
ers had an array of digital wireframing tools that were optimized for making  
sketch-fidelity drawings. We’re just starting to see design systems teams con-  
sider adding sketch-fidelity elements into their toolkits. This is a fascinating  
trend and one we’ll be following to see where it develops.  
Now, let’s take a look at how one large organization uses design systems...  
Case study\: GE design system  
In 2012, GE opened GE Software in San Ramon, California. This new “Center  
of Excellence” \(CoE\) was designed to help GE improve its software game. A  
few years earlier, a strategic review helped the company to see just how central  
software had become to their business\: measured in lines of code, GE was  
something like the 17th largest software company in the world. And yet they  
felt they were not treating software development with the focus it deserved.  
San Ramon included a new team at GE\: the GE Software User Experience  
Team. This small team at the heart of a giant company created their first design  
system in 2013 in order to scale the impact they could have. Indeed, with  
fewer than 50 designers to collaborate with more than 14,000 developers  
\(inside an organization of more than 300,000 people\), there was no way that  
this startup design team could grow quickly enough to have a meaningful  
effect at GE.  
The team’s first design system, called IIDS, for the Industrial Internet Design  
System, was designed by a group of internal designers with the help of a small  
128  
LEAN UX team from Frog Design, one of the leading design firms in the world. The team  
built the system on top of Bootstrap, the HTML/CSS framework created by  
Twitter. It proved incredibly successful. Within a few years, it had been down-  
loaded by internal developers more than 11,000 times and had been used to  
create hundreds of applications. It helped software teams across the company  
produce better looking, more consistent applications. And, perhaps just as  
important, it created a huge amount of visibility for the software team and the  
UX team at San Ramon.  
With that success came some problems. To be sure, simply having a good UI  
kit doesn’t mean that a team can produce a well-designed product. Design sys-  
tems don’t solve every design problem. And Bootstrap was showing its limits  
as a platform choice. It had helped the team achieve their first objectives\: get  
something out quickly, provide broad coverage of UI elements, and create wide  
adoption by being easier to use than “roll-your-own” solutions. But Bootstrap  
was hard to maintain and update and was just too big for most needs.  
In 2015, GE Software, having had great success as an internal service bureau,  
morphed into GE Digital, a revenue-generating business in its own right. Their  
first product was called Predix \(Figure 14-3\), a platform on top of which devel-  
opers inside and outside of GE can build software for industrial applications.  
And with this change of strategy, the team realized they needed to rethink their  
design system. Whereas earlier the goal had been to provide broad coverage  
and broad adoption, the new design system would be driven by new needs\: it  
needed to enable great Predix applications, which was a more focused problem  
than before. It needed to limit the number of UI choices rather than supporting  
every possible UI widget. It still needed to be easy to adopt and use—it was  
now intended for use by GE customers—but now it was imperative that it be  
easy to maintain as well.  
The design system team had by this time grown to about 15 people and  
included design technologists \(frontend developers who are passionate about  
both design and code\), interaction designers, graphic designers, a technical  
writer, and a product owner.  
CHAPTER 14\: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN  
129 Figure 14-3. The GE Predix design system  
The team chose to move the design system to a new technology platform  
\(Figure 14-4\). No longer based on Bootstrap, the system has instead been cre-  
ated with Polymer, a JavaScript framework that allows the team to implement  
Web Components. Web Components has emerged in the last few years as a  
way to enable more mature frontend development practices.  
To create the new design system, the team spent nearly six months prototyp-  
ing. Significantly, the team did not work in isolation. Instead, they paired with  
one of the application teams and thus were designing components to meet the  
needs of their users—in this case, the designers and developers working on the  
application teams. This point is really important. Collaborative design takes  
130  
LEAN UX many forms. Sometimes it means designing with your cross-functional team.  
Sometimes it means designing with your end users. In this instance, it was a  
hybrid\: designing with a cross-functional team of designers and developers  
who actually are your users.  
Figure 14-4. The GE Predix design system on GitHub  
# Collaborating with Geographically Distributed Teams  
Physical distance is one of the biggest challenges to strong collaboration. Some  
of the methods we’ve discussed in this book become more difficult when a  
team isn’t all in the same location. That said—as we all learned in 2020,  
thanks to the COVID-19 crisis—you can still find ways to collaborate when  
you and your team are separated by distance. Tools such as Zoom, Skype,  
Google Meet, and Slack can provide teams with the means to collaborate in  
real time. Google Docs and similar systems allow people to collaborate on  
documents at the same time. Team collaboration tools like Mural and Miro  
serve as a space for creative collaboration. Trello and wikis make it possible  
for teams to track information together. Design tools like Figma are built from  
the ground up with collaboration in mind. And a phone with a camera can  
make it easy to quickly share photos in an ad hoc way. All these tools can  
CHAPTER 14\: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN  
131 make cross-time-zone collaboration more effective and can help teams to feel  
virtually connected for long periods of time during the day.  
Collaborating with Distributed Teams  
When we talk about distributed teams, we’re actually talking about a variety  
of different scenarios. Sometimes we mean that we’re in an office in NYC with  
part of our team, and we need to work with other teammates who are working  
in the London office. Other times it means that we are on 2020-style lock-  
down, working from home with our pets and our kids and our partners in the  
same room. Sometimes we’re talking about a hybrid situation—most of us are  
in the office, but a few folks are calling in to a meeting. What works in one of  
these contexts might not work in others, but there are some important ideas  
that you can use to make collaboration easier in any context.  
Level the playing field. Have you ever called in to a meeting where you were  
the only person on the phone, and everyone else was sitting around the table?  
It’s tough. Now imagine a room full of people working on sticky notes or  
drawing on the whiteboard, while you’re sitting in your kitchen listening on  
the phone. It’s going to be difficult—perhaps impossible—for you to make a  
meaningful contribution. One fix for this is to insist that your meeting-room  
tools be chosen so that everyone can participate. Instead of using the  
conference-room whiteboard, your team can open a shared document or use  
an online whiteboard tool like Mural or Miro. This means that everyone in the  
conference room will need their own laptop or tablet, but it will also ensure  
that everyone can collaborate as peers.  
Create social connections. It can be tempting to treat online meetings in a very  
regimented way. Gather the team, hit the agenda hard, end on time, boom.  
Remote meetings start and end more abruptly than physical meetings. Think  
about it—when we meet in a conference room, we chat for a few minutes in  
the hallway before the meeting. We gossip as we take our chairs. We walk out  
of the room together and get a coffee together to debrief. These moments may  
seem incidental to the work that we do, but they are actually a crucial compo-  
nent of work—they give us time to build the social bonds that allow work to  
happen. Make the effort to create social connections across remote collabora-  
tions. Build in extra time for slow openings to your meetings. Schedule team  
social calls across the distance. Create social/nonwork channels in your team  
Slack workspaces. If you can travel to see your remote teammates, make sure  
to build team social events into your travel agendas.

LEAN UXMaking Collaboration Work  
Not every team will find that collaboration comes easily. Most of us begin our  
careers by developing our individual technical skills as designers, developers,  
and so on. And in many organizations, collaboration across disciplines is rare.  
\(It’s rarely taught in school as well, either as an explicit topic or in the way our  
educational systems are set up.\) So it’s no wonder that it can feel challenging.  
One of the most powerful tools for improving collaboration is the Agile techni-  
que of the retrospective and the related practice of creating team working  
agreements. Retrospectives are regularly scheduled meetings, usually held at  
the end of every sprint, in which the team takes an honest look back at the  
past sprint. They examine what went well, what went poorly, and what the  
team wants to improve. Usually, the team will select a few things to work on  
for the next sprint. We can think of no more powerful tool for improving col-  
laboration than the regular practice of effective retrospectives.  
A team working agreement is a document that serves as a partner to the retro-  
spective. It keeps track of how the team has chosen to work together. It’s a self-  
created, continuously updated rule book that the team agrees to follow. At  
each retrospective, the team should check in with their working agreement to  
see if they’re still following it and if they need to update it to include new  
agreements or remove old ones that no longer make sense.  
Here’s an outline for what you should consider covering in your team working  
agreements\:  
Process overview  
What kind of process are we using? Agile? If so, what flavor? How long  
are our iterations?  
Ceremonies  
What rituals will the team observe? For example, when is stand-up each  
day? When do we hold planning meetings and demos?  
Communication/Tools  
What systems will we use to communicate and document our work? What  
is our project management tool? Where do we keep our assets?  
Culture/Safety/Conflict resolution  
What kind of team culture do we want? What do we need as individuals to  
feel safe with our teammates? What will we do when \(not if!\) there’s con-  
flict? How will we resolve disagreements?  
Working hours  
Who works where? When are folks in the office? If we’re in different loca-  
tions, what accommodations will we make for time-zone differences?  
CHAPTER 14\: COLLABORATIVE DESIGN  
133 Requirements and design  
How do we handle requirements definition, story writing, and prioritiza-  
tion? When is a story ready for design? When is a design ready to be bro-  
ken into stories?  
Development  
What practices have we settled on? Do we use pair programming? What  
testing style will we use? What methods will we use for source control?  
Work-in-progress limits  
What is our backlog and icebox size? What WIP limits exist in various  
stages of our process?  
Deployment  
What is our release cadence? How do we do story acceptance?  
And any additional agreements.  
Psychological Safety  
Collaborative design is a creative activity. To be effective, people need to feel safe. This  
means physical, emotional, and psychological safety. We often hear this idea expressed  
in superficial ways, like “there are no bad ideas in brainstorming” or “there’s no such  
thing as a stupid question. ” And while those things are true, they are certainly not suffi-  
cient. Psychological safety is more than that. Author Alla Weinberg defines psychologi-  
cal safety as “the shared belief that no one on the team will embarrass or punish any-  
one else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.”  
Lean UX is all about the idea that design is an iterative process. You need to try, learn,  
and iterate. In other words, you need to make mistakes in order to make progress. You  
can’t do this if you and your team don’t feel safe.  
If you find yourself or your team stuck in a rut, experiencing high degrees of conflict, or  
generally acting scared, take a step back and ask, Do I feel safe on this team? Do I think  
my team members feel safe? If you’re not sure, consider taking a step back and looking  
at the work of writers like Weinberg and Amy Edmondson to help you and your team  
address these concerns.

LEAN UXWrapping Up  
Collaborative design \(Figure 14-5\) is an evolution of the UX design process. In  
this chapter, we discussed how opening up the design process brings the entire  
team deeper into the project. We showed you practical techniques you can use  
to create shared understanding—the fundamental currency of Lean UX. Using  
tools like design systems, style guides, collaborative design sessions, Design  
Studio, and simple conversation, your team can build a shared understanding  
that allows them to move forward at a much faster pace than in traditional  
environments.

# Feedback and Research  
Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose.  
Zora Neale Hurston  
Research with users is at the heart of UX design. Too often, though, teams out-  
source research work to specialized research teams. And too often, research  
activities take place on rare occasions—either at the beginning of a project or  
at the end. Lean UX solves these problems by making research both continu-  
ous and collaborative. Let’s dig in to see how to do that.  
In this chapter, we cover the following\:  
• Collaborative research techniques that you can use to build shared under-  
standing with your team  
• Continuous research techniques to build small, informal, qualitative  
research studies into every iteration  
• How to use small units of regular research to build longitudinal research  
studies  
• How to reconcile contradictory feedback from multiple sources  
• What artifacts to test and what results you can expect from each of these  
tests  
• How to incorporate the voice of the customer throughout the Lean UX  
cycle  
137 Continuous and Collaborative Research  
Lean UX takes basic UX research techniques and overlays two important  
ideas. First, Lean UX research is continuous. This means you build research  
activities into every sprint. Instead of being a costly and disruptive “big bang”  
process, we make it bite-sized so that we can fit it into our ongoing process.  
Second, Lean UX research is collaborative. This means that you don’t rely on  
the work of specialized researchers to deliver learning to your team. Instead,  
research activities and responsibilities are distributed and shared across the  
entire team. By eliminating the handoff between researchers and team mem-  
bers, we increase the quality of our learning. Our goal in all of this is to create  
a rich shared understanding across the team.  
Collaborative Discovery  
Collaborative discovery is the process of working together as a team to test  
ideas in the market. It is one of the two main cross-functional techniques that  
create shared understanding on a Lean UX team. \(Collaborative design, cov-  
ered in Chapter 14, is the other.\) Collaborative discovery is an approach to  
research that gets the entire team out of the building—literally and figuratively  
—to meet with and learn from customers and users. It gives everyone on the  
team a chance to see how the hypotheses are tested and, most important, mul-  
tiplies the number of perspectives the team can use to gather customer insight.  
It’s essential that you and your team conduct research together; that’s why we  
call it collaborative discovery. Outsourcing research dramatically reduces its  
value\: it wastes time, it limits team building, and it filters the information  
through deliverables, handoffs, and interpretation. Don’t do it.  
Researchers sometimes feel uneasy about this approach. As trained professio-  
nals, they are right to point out that they have special knowledge that is impor-  
tant to the research process. We agree. That’s why you should include a  
researcher on your team if you can. Just don’t outsource the work to that per-  
son. Instead, use the researcher as an expert guide to help your team plan their  
work and to lead the team through their research activities. In the same way  
that Lean UX encourages designers to take a more facilitative approach, Lean  
UX asks the same of researchers. Researchers should use their expertise to help  
the team plan good research, ask good questions, and select the right methods  
for the job. Just don’t do all the research for them.  
138  
LEAN UX Collaborative discovery in the field  
Collaborative discovery is simply a way to get out into the field with your  
team. Here’s how you do it\:  
1\. As a team, review your questions, assumptions, hypotheses, and MVPs.  
Decide as a team what you need to learn. \(Box 7 on the Lean UX Canvas.\)  
2\. Working as a team, decide on your research method. \(Box 8 on the Lean  
UX Canvas.\) If you are planning to work directly with customers and  
users, decide who you’ll need to speak to and observe to address your  
learning goals.  
3\. Create an interview guide \(see the sidebar “The Interview Guide”\) that  
you can all use to guide your conversations.  
4\. Break your team into research pairs, mixing up the various roles and disci-  
plines within each pair \(i.e., try not to have designers paired with design-  
ers\). If you are doing this research over a number of days, try to mix up  
the interview pairs each day so that people have a chance to share experi-  
ences with various team members.  
5\. Arm each pair with a version of your MVP, prototype, or other materials  
you want to show to the research participants.  
6\. Send each team out to meet with customers/users.  
7\. One team member interviews while the other takes notes.  
8\. Begin with questions, conversations, and observations.  
9\. Demonstrate the MVP later in the session and allow the customer to inter-  
act with it.  
10\. Collect notes as the customer provides feedback.  
11\. When the lead interviewer is done, switch roles to give the notetaker a  
chance to ask follow-up questions.  
12\. At the end of the interview, ask the customer for referrals to other people  
who might also provide useful feedback.  
CHAPTER 15\: FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH  
139The Interview Guide  
To prepare for fieldwork, create a small cheat sheet that will fit into your notebook. On  
your cheat sheet, write the questions and topics that you’ve decided to cover. This way  
you’ll always be prepared to move the interview along.  
When planning your questions, think about a sequential funnel\:  
• First, try to identify if the customer is in your target audience.  
• Then, try to confirm any problem hypotheses you have for this segment.  
Finally, if you have a prototype or mock-up with you, show this last to avoid limiting  
the conversation to your vision of the solution.  
A collaborative discovery example  
A team we worked with at PayPal set out with a clickable prototype to con-  
duct a collaborative discovery session. The team was made up of two design-  
ers, a UX researcher, four developers, and a product manager; they split into  
teams of two and three. They paired each developer with a nondeveloper.  
Before setting out, they brainstormed what they’d like to learn from their pro-  
totype and used these ideas to write brief interview guides. Their product was  
targeted at a broad consumer market, so they decided to just head out to the  
local shopping malls scattered around their office. Each pair targeted a differ-  
ent mall. They spent two hours in the field, stopping strangers, asking them  
questions, and demonstrating their prototypes. To build up their individual  
skill sets, they changed roles \(from lead to notetaker\) an hour into their  
research.  
When they reconvened, each pair read their notes to the rest of the team.  
Almost immediately they began to see patterns emerge, confirming some of  
their assumptions and rejecting others. Using this new information, they adjus-  
ted the design of their prototype and headed out again later that afternoon.  
After a full day of field research, it was clear which parts of their idea worked  
well and which parts would need adjusting. When they began the next sprint  
the following day, every member of the team was working from the same base-  
line of clarity, having built a shared understanding by means of collaborative  
discovery the day before.  
Continuous Learning  
Designers and researchers face a lot of pressure to force their work into a  
sprint framework. The problem is that some work just takes a long time, espe-  
cially some kinds of research. This long-cycle work has the potential to create  
conflict on Agile teams. Researchers are used to planning multiweek research  
140  
LEAN UX projects, for example. And when they try to do this on an Agile team and put  
their eight-week research project into the backlog, they end up having to  
explain at the end of every sprint why their work isn’t “done.” It makes every-  
one unhappy.  
Going back to principles  
When faced with a conflict like this, it’s helpful to go back to principles.  
Remember this principle from Chapter 2? Don’t do the same thing faster. And  
this one? Beware of phases. These principles tell us that we shouldn’t try to fit  
an eight-week research study into a two-week sprint. Instead, we should  
rethink the way we plan our research and the way we think about “done” for  
research work.  
To do that, let’s consider why the Scrum framework is so insistent on the  
notion of done. Scrum says that any work you do during a sprint should be  
done by the end of that sprint. This is a powerful forcing function\: it forces  
everyone to show their work. And it makes the assumption that finished work  
is valuable. \(That’s not always true, but that’s the goal.\)  
For us then, the goal of done is really\: “Be transparent and deliver value every  
sprint.”  
How can we use that idea when we’re planning research? Well, instead of  
thinking about completing our eight-week study in two weeks, we can ask,  
“How can we be transparent and deliver value every two weeks, even as we’re  
working on an eight-week study?” We might deliver an experience report at  
sprint demo meetings. We might present some early conclusions after complet-  
ing half of our interviews. We might present and discuss the new questions that  
have come up as we’ve started to learn new things. Those things are all valua-  
ble to the team. They make the work transparent. They maintain the spirit of  
Agile while also keeping the integrity of the research work high.  
Continuous research\: Research is never done  
A high-functioning Agile team should be doing research continuously. A criti-  
cal best practice in Lean UX is building a regular cadence of customer involve-  
ment. Regularly scheduled conversations with customers let you minimize the  
time between hypothesis creation, experiment design, and user feedback—giv-  
ing you the opportunity to validate your hypotheses quickly.  
In other words, research should inform the decisions the product team is mak-  
ing. Since you’re making decisions constantly, you want to make sure you have  
the latest research data at hand at all times. \(And conversely, the research  
agenda should sometimes drive development priorities because sometimes you  
need to make stuff specifically support the needs of your researchers. It’s a  
two-way conversation.\)  
CHAPTER 15\: FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH  
141 In general, knowing you’re never more than a few days away from getting cus-  
tomer feedback has a powerful effect on teams. It takes the pressure off of  
your decision making because you know that you will soon have an opportu-  
nity to get meaningful data from the market—and course correct quickly if  
needed.  
So stop thinking in terms of research studies and research phases, and instead  
think of research as a continuous part of your team’s operating rhythm. Share  
your work. Deliver value each week. Be honest about what you do and don’t  
know. Help your team learn. The rest of this chapter will show you how.  
Continuous learning in the lab\: Three users every Thursday  
Although you can create a standing schedule of fieldwork based on the afore-  
mentioned ideas, it’s much easier \(especially for companies that work with  
consumers\) to bring customers into the building—you just need to be a little  
creative to get the entire team involved.  
We like to use a weekly rhythm to schedule research, as demonstrated in  
Figure 15-1. We call this “Three, twelve, one” because it’s based on the follow-  
ing guidelines\: three users; by twelve noon; once a week.  
Figure 15-1. The three, twelve, one activity calendar  
Here’s how the team’s activities break down\:  
Monday\: Recruiting and planning  
Decide, as a team, what will be tested this week. Decide who you need to  
recruit for tests and start the recruiting process. Outsource this job if at all  
possible\: it’s very time-consuming \(see the sidebar “A Word About Recruit-  
ing Participants” on page 144\).  
142  
LEAN UX Tuesday\: Refine the components of the test  
Based on what stage your MVP is in, begin refining the design, the proto-  
type, or the product to a point that will allow you to tell at least one com-  
plete story when your customers see it.  
Wednesday\: Continue refining, write the script, and finalize recruiting  
Put the final touches on your MVP. Write the test script that your modera-  
tor will follow with each participant. \(Your moderator should be someone  
on the team if at all possible.\) Finalize the recruiting and schedule for  
Thursday’s tests.  
Thursday\: Test!  
Spend the morning testing your MVP with customers. Spend no more than  
an hour with each customer. Everyone on the team should take notes. The  
team should plan to watch from a separate location. Review the findings  
with the entire project team immediately after the last participant is done.  
Friday\: Plan  
Use your new insight to decide whether your hypotheses were validated  
and what you need to do next.  
Simplify your test environment  
Many firms have established usability labs in-house—and it used to be you  
needed one. These days, you don’t need a lab—all you need is a quiet place in  
your office and a computer with a network connection and a webcam. It used  
to be necessary to use specialized usability testing products to record sessions  
and connect remote observers. These days, you don’t even need that. We rou-  
tinely run tests with remote observers using nothing more exotic than Zoom.  
The ability to connect remote observers is a key element. It makes it possible  
for you to bring the test sessions to team members and stakeholders who can’t  
be present. This has an enormous impact on collaboration because it spreads  
understanding of your customers deep into your organization. It’s hard to  
overstate how powerful this is.  
Who should watch?  
The short answer is your entire team. Like almost every other aspect of Lean  
UX, usability testing should be a group activity. With the entire team watching  
the tests, absorbing the feedback, and reacting in real time, you’ll find the need  
for subsequent debriefings reduced. The team will learn firsthand where their  
efforts are succeeding and failing. Nothing is more humbling \(and motivating\)  
than seeing a user struggle with the software you just built.  
CHAPTER 15\: FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH  
143A Word About Recruiting Participants  
Recruiting, scheduling, and confirming participants is time intensive. Save your team  
from this additional overhead by offloading the work to a dedicated recruiter. Some  
companies have hired internal recruiters to do this work as part of their DesignOps or  
ResearchOps team, while others outsource the work to a third party. In either case, the  
cost is worth it. The recruiter does the work and gets paid for each participant they  
bring in. In addition, your recruiter takes care of the screening, scheduling, and replace-  
ment of no-shows on testing day. Third-party recruiters typically charge for each partic-  
ipant they recruit. You’ll also have to budget for whatever compensation you offer to  
the participants themselves.  
Continuous research\: Some examples  
Companies operationalize continuous research in many different ways. For  
example, the team at ABN AMRO, a bank in the Netherlands, runs what they  
call a Customer Validation Carousel once a week. This weekly user research  
event is structured like speed dating. Each week, five customers come into the  
company’s offices. Each customer is set up at their own research station. Then  
a group of interviewers come into the room and spread out, each sitting with  
one customer. \(At ABN AMRO, many of the interviewers are “people who do  
research”—in other words, designers and product people rather than trained  
researchers. Because of this, the trained researchers on staff work with them  
before the event to help them create their research plan and discussion guides.  
Interviews are often conducted by a pair of interviewers who work together  
and take turns interviewing and taking notes.\)  
The interviewers conduct 15-minute interviews with each participant. When  
the 15 minutes are up, each interviewer or pair gets up and moves to the next  
participant—kind of like musical chairs. In this way, each interviewer gets to  
speak to each participant. After everyone has spoken with everyone else, the  
customers leave and the interviewers convene to debrief. Normally, each inter-  
viewer is assigned to a single topic, but even though they may not be working  
on the same set of questions, the debrief is valuable, helping them better under-  
stand the customers and helping them to interpret the data that they’ve just  
collected. They capture learnings from this event on a single-page insight tem-  
plate and then add these documents to the company’s shared insights database.  
Researcher Ike Breed, who helped set up this process, told us that this sharing  
step really democratized research. “People thought the insights database was a  
really formal thing. They asked, ‘you mean I can put something in there?’” By  
opening the process up to contribution from a wider group, it helped the prod-  
uct and design teams feel more ownership of the customer insights process and  
the data that was collected as part of that process.  
144  
LEAN UX Testing Tuesdays  
Another researcher we spoke to told us about how he started a practice called  
“Testing Tuesdays” at his company, a financial services firm building  
consumer-facing technology. Andrew Bourne was hired there as a usability  
researcher. When he arrived, he discovered a long backlog of work waiting for  
him. As he worked through the backlog, he started reporting on the research  
results at every Sprint Demo, which, at his company, took place every Tuesday.  
Because he had such a large backlog of work, there was always something new  
to report. To help make sure that his reports got heard by everyone who was  
interested, he started publicizing the contents of his briefing in advance using  
email announcements. He’d announce, “This week, I’ll be reporting on X.”  
This had two really positive effects. First, it got people to show up for his  
briefings—often many more people were interested in the results than he’d  
anticipated. Additionally, product people started coming to him asking for his  
partnership in the research that they wanted to do. In other words, it grew the  
demand for research. And not just usability studies. The folks coming to him  
were asking for all kinds of research—including early-stage formative studies.  
Continuous Research at Sperientia Labs  
Sperientia Labs is a user experience research agency of about 30 people based in Pue-  
bla, Mexico. Sperientia delivers research to clients in a unique format\: they use a series  
of one-week research sprints. “We use an approach in which the Agile framework is  
always in mind,” says founder Victor M. González.  
This approach has several benefits. First, González says that most of their clients are  
already working in an Agile rhythm. This allows Sperientia to synchronize their timeline  
with the timeline of the clients.  
Another benefit is the rapid way that these cycles deliver results. Sperientia delivers  
discovery interviews and usability tests over the course of a highly structured week.  
They plan and recruit on Friday, continue recruiting and prepping on Monday, then run  
tests with between three and six participants on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. By  
Wednesday afternoon, they hold a debrief session with their clients. “In many cases,  
this debrief is all the clients need, and they can get to work immediately on what  
they’ve learned,” González says. Still, Sperientia uses Thursdays to capture the results  
and recommendations in a report, and then meets with the clients on Friday morning  
to review the findings in detail. After lunch on Friday, they’re ready to begin planning  
their next cycle.  
Now, not all research objectives can be met in a week, and a typical Sperientia research  
program is 3 to 12 months long. So even though they use one-week research cycles  
throughout all of their programs, they are not limited to answering only questions that  
can be answered in a single week. Instead, they use continuous one-week cycles to  
address a much broader range of questions.  
CHAPTER 15\: FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH  
145 The agency works with a variety of client research objectives\: they help clients under-  
stand and develop value propositions, understand users’ jobs to be done, and evaluate  
the usability and design of their offerings.  
By using a program of multiple one-week cycles, Sperientia can run research programs  
that grow and evolve as they learn. They can run research programs that keep pace  
with the development of a product. They can run programs that are longitudinal in  
nature. And though their approach is fundamentally qualitative \(based on one-on-one  
sessions with users and customers\), they can build programs that gather quantitative  
data by asking the same questions week over week.  
Recently, Sperientia began experimenting with a new two-week research sprint format.  
They use this format when they have to answer questions that involve some kind of  
prototype. In these cases, they will extend the cycle to include a week of prototype  
development, followed by their typical research week. To accomplish this, they aug-  
ment the research team to include designers who can help them create prototypes for  
testing.  
So working with these short one-week cycles helps the agency match their client’s  
pace, helps them deliver rapid and continuous results, and has one bonus benefit.  
González describes it this way\: “We get to have our weekends with the peace of mind  
that we are done!”  
Making Sense of the Research\: A Team Activity  
Whether your team does fieldwork or labwork, research generates a lot of raw  
data. Making sense of this can be time-consuming and frustrating—so the pro-  
cess is often handed over to specialists who are asked to synthesize research  
findings. You shouldn’t do this. Instead, work as hard as you can to make  
sense of the data as a team.  
As soon as possible after the research sessions are over—preferably the same  
day, if not then the following day—gather the team together for a review ses-  
sion. When the team has reassembled, ask everyone to read their findings to  
one another. One really efficient way to do this is to transcribe the notes people  
read out loud onto index cards or sticky notes and then sort the notes into  
themes. This process of reading, grouping, and discussing gets everyone’s input  
out on the table and builds the shared understanding that you seek. With  
themes identified, you and your team can then determine the next steps for  
your MVP.  
146  
LEAN UX Confusion, contradiction, and \(lack of\) clarity  
As you and your team collect feedback from various sources and try to synthe-  
size your findings, you will inevitably come across situations in which your  
data presents you with contradictions. How do you make sense of it all? Here  
are a couple of ways to maintain your momentum and ensure that you’re max-  
imizing your learning.  
Look for patterns  
As you review the research, keep an eye out for patterns in the data. These  
patterns reveal multiple instances of user opinion that represent elements  
to explore. If something doesn’t fall into a pattern, it is likely an outlier.  
Place your outliers in a “parking lot”  
Tempting as it is to ignore outliers \(or try to serve them in your solution\),  
don’t do it. Instead, create a parking lot or backlog. As your research pro-  
gresses over time \(remember\: you’re doing this every week\), you might dis-  
cover other outliers that match the pattern. Be patient.  
Verify with other sources  
If you’re not convinced the feedback you’re seeing through one channel is  
valid, look for it in other channels. Are the customer support emails  
reflecting the same concerns as your usability studies? Is the value of your  
prototype echoed with customers inside and outside your office? If not,  
your sample might have been disproportionately skewed.  
Identifying Patterns over Time  
Typical UX research programs are structured to get a conclusive answer\: you  
will plan to do enough research to conclusively answer a question or set of  
questions. Lean UX research takes a different approach. It puts a priority on  
being continuous—which means that you are structuring your research activi-  
ties very differently. Instead of running big studies, you are seeing a small num-  
ber of users every week. This means that some questions might remain open  
over a couple of weeks. One big benefit, though, is that interesting patterns can  
reveal themselves over time.  
For example, over the course of regular test sessions from 2008 to 2011, the  
team at TheLadders watched an interesting change in their customers’ attitudes  
over time. In 2008, when they first began meeting with job seekers on a regular  
basis, they would discuss various ways to communicate with employers. One  
of the options they proposed was SMS. In 2008, the audience, made up of  
high-income earners in their late 40s and early 50s, showed a strong disdain  
for SMS as a legitimate communication method. To them, it was something  
their kids did \(and that perhaps they did with their kids\), but it was certainly  
not a “proper” way to conduct a job search.  
CHAPTER 15\: FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH  
147 By 2011, though, SMS messages had taken off in the United States. As text  
messaging gained acceptance in business culture, audience attitudes began to  
soften. Week after week, as they sat with job seekers, they began to see opin-  
ions about SMS change. The team saw job seekers become far more likely to  
use SMS in a midcareer job search than they would have just a few years  
earlier.  
The team at TheLadders would never have recognized this as an audience-wide  
trend were it not for two things. First, they were speaking with a sample of  
their audience, week in and week out. Additionally, though, the team took a  
systematic approach to investigating long-term trends. As part of their regular  
interaction with customers, they always asked a regular set of level-setting  
questions to capture the “vital signs” of the job seeker’s search—no matter  
what other questions, features, or products they were testing. By doing this,  
the team was able to establish a baseline and address bigger trends over time.  
The findings about SMS would not have changed the team’s understanding of  
their audience if they’d represented just a few anecdotal data points. But aggre-  
gated over time, these data points became part of a very powerful dataset.  
When planning your research, it’s important to consider not just the urgent  
questions—the things you want to learn over the next few weeks. You should  
also consider the big questions. You still need to plan big standalone studies to  
get at some of these questions. But with some planning, you should be able to  
work a lot of long-term learning into your weekly studies.  
Test what you’ve got  
To maintain a regular cadence of user testing, your team must adopt a “test-  
what-you-got” policy. Whatever is ready on testing day is what goes in front of  
the users. This policy liberates your team from rushing toward testing day  
deadlines—or, worse, delaying research activities in pursuit of some elusive  
“perfect” moment. Instead, when you adopt a “test-what-you-got” approach,  
you’ll find yourself taking advantage of your weekly test sessions to get insight  
on whatever is ready, and this will create insight for you at every stage of  
design and development. You must, however, set expectations properly for the  
type of feedback you’ll be able to generate with each type of artifact.  
Sketches. Feedback collected on sketches helps you validate the value of your  
concept \(see Figure 15-2\). They’re great conversation prompts to support inter-  
views, and they help to make abstract concepts concrete, which helps generate  
shared understanding. What you won’t get from sketches is detailed, step-by-  
step feedback on the process, insight about specific design elements, or even  
meaningful feedback on copy choices. You won’t be able to learn much \(if any-  
thing\) about the usability of your concept.  
148  
LEAN UX Figure 15-2. Example of a sketch that can be used with customers  
Static wireframes. Showing test participants wireframes \(Figure 15-3\) lets you  
assess the information hierarchy and layout of your experience. In addition,  
you’ll get feedback on taxonomy, navigation, and information architecture.  
You’ll receive the first trickles of workflow feedback, but at this point your test  
participants are focused primarily on the words on the page and the selections  
they’re making. Wireframes provide a good opportunity to begin testing copy  
choices.  
CHAPTER 15\: FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH  
149 Figure 15-3. Example of a wireframe  
High-fidelity visual mock-ups \(not clickable\). Moving into high-fidelity visual-  
design assets, you receive much more detailed feedback. Test participants will  
be able to respond to branding, aesthetics, and visual hierarchy, as well as  
aspects of figure/ground relationships, grouping of elements, and the clarity of  
your calls to action. Your test participants will also \(almost certainly\) weigh in  
on the effectiveness of your color palette. \(See Figure 15-4.\)  
Nonclickable mock-ups still don’t let your customers interact naturally with  
the design or experience the workflow of your solution. Instead of watching  
your users click, tap, and swipe, you need to ask them what they would expect  
and then validate those responses against your planned experience.  
150  
LEAN UX Figure 15-4. Example of mock-up from Skype in the Classroom \(design by Made By Many\)  
CHAPTER 15\: FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH  
151 Clickable mock-ups. Clickable mock-ups, like that shown in Figure 15-4,  
increase the fidelity of the interaction by linking together a set of static assets  
into a simulation of the product experience. These days, most design tools  
make it easy to link together a number of static screens to produce these types  
of mock-ups. Visually, they can be high, medium, or even low fidelity. The  
value here is not so much the visual polish but rather the ability to simulate  
workflow and to observe how users interact with your designs.  
Designers used to have limited tool choices for creating clickable mock-ups,  
but in recent years, we’ve seen a huge proliferation of tools. Some tools are  
optimized for making mobile mock-ups, others are for the web, and still others  
are platform neutral. Most have no ability to work with data, but with some  
\(like Axure\), you can create basic data-driven or conditional logic-driven simu-  
lations. Additionally, design tools such as Figma, Sketch, InVision, and Adobe  
XD include “mirror” features with which you can see your design work in real  
time on mobile devices and link screens together to create prototypes without  
special prototyping tools.  
Coded prototypes. Coded prototypes are useful because they have the best  
ability to deliver high fidelity in terms of functionality. This makes for the  
closest-to-real simulation that you can put in front of your users. It replicates  
the design, behavior, and workflow of your product. You can test with real  
data. You can integrate with other systems. All of this makes coded prototypes  
very powerful; it also makes them the most complex to produce. But because  
the feedback you gain is based on such a close simulation, you can treat that  
feedback as more authoritative than the feedback you gain from other  
simulations.  
Monitoring Techniques for Continuous and Collaborative  
Discovery  
In the preceding discussions, we looked at ways to use qualitative research on  
a regular basis to evaluate your hypotheses. However, as soon as you launch  
your product or feature, your customers will begin giving you constant feed-  
back—and not only on your product. They will tell you about themselves,  
about the market, about the competition. This insight is invaluable—and it  
comes into your organization from every corner. Seek out these treasure troves  
of customer intelligence within your organization and harness them to drive  
your ongoing product design and research, as depicted in Figure 15-5.  
152  
LEAN UX Figure 15-5. Customers can provide feedback through many channels  
Customer service  
Customer support agents talk to more customers on a daily basis than you will  
talk to over the course of an entire project. There are multiple ways to harness  
their knowledge\:  
• Reach out to them and ask them what they’re hearing from customers  
about the sections of the product on which you’re working.  
• Hold regular monthly meetings with them to understand the trends. What  
do customers love this month? What do they hate?  
• Tap into their deep product knowledge to learn how they would solve the  
challenges your team is working on. Include them in design sessions and  
design reviews.  
• Incorporate your hypotheses into their call scripts. One of the cheapest  
ways to test your ideas is to suggest it as a fix to customers calling in with  
relevant complaints.  
CHAPTER 15\: FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH  
153 In the mid-2000s, Jeff ran the UX team at a midsized tech company in Port-  
land, Oregon. One of the ways that team prioritized the work they did was by  
regularly checking the pulse of the customer base. The team did this with a  
standing monthly meeting with customer service representatives. Each month,  
Customer Service would provide the UX team with the top 10 things custom-  
ers were complaining about. The UX team then used this information to focus  
their efforts and to subsequently measure the efficacy of their work. At the end  
of the month, the next conversation with Customer Service gave the team a  
clear indication of whether or not their efforts were bearing fruit. If the issue  
was not receding in the top-10 list, the solutions had not worked.  
This approach generated an additional benefit. The Customer Service team  
realized there was someone listening to their insights and began proactively  
sharing customer feedback above and beyond the monthly meeting. The dia-  
logue that was created provided the UX team with a continuous feedback loop  
to inform and test product hypotheses.  
On-site feedback surveys  
Set up a feedback mechanism in your product with which customers can send  
you their thoughts regularly. Here are a few options\:  
• Simple email forms  
• Customer support forums  
• Third-party community sites  
You can repurpose these tools for research by doing things like the following\:  
• Counting how many inbound emails you’re getting from a particular sec-  
tion of the site  
• Participating in online discussions and testing some of your hypotheses  
• Exploring community sites to discover and recruit hard-to-find types of  
users  
These inbound customer feedback channels provide feedback from the point of  
view of your most active and engaged customers. Here are a few tactics for  
getting other points of view.  
Search logs. Search terms are clear indicators of what customers are seeking  
on your site. Search patterns indicate what they’re finding and what they’re not  
finding. Repeated queries with slight variations show a user’s challenge in find-  
ing certain information.  
154  
LEAN UX One way to use search logs for MVP validation is to launch a test page for the  
feature you’re planning. Following the search, logs will inform you as to  
whether the test content \(or feature\) on that page is meeting the user’s needs. If  
users continue to search on variations of that content, your experiment has  
failed.  
Site usage analytics. Site usage logs and analytics packages—especially funnel  
analyses—show how customers are using the site, where they’re dropping off,  
and how they try to manipulate the product to do the things they need or  
expect it to do. Understanding these reports provides real-world context for  
the decisions the team needs to make.  
In addition, use analytics tools to determine the success of experiments that  
have launched publicly. How has the experiment shifted usage of the product?  
Are your efforts achieving the outcome you defined? These tools provide an  
unbiased answer.  
If you’re just starting to build a product, build usage analytics into it from day  
one. Third-party metrics products like Kissmetrics and MixPanel make it easy  
and inexpensive to implement this functionality, and provide invaluable infor-  
mation to support continuous learning.  
A/B testing. A/B testing is a technique, originally developed by marketers, to  
gauge which of two \(or more\) relatively similar concepts achieve the defined  
goal more effectively. When applied in the Lean UX framework, A/B testing  
becomes a powerful tool to determine the validity of your hypotheses. Apply-  
ing A/B testing is relatively straightforward after your ideas evolve into work-  
ing code. Here’s how it works\:  
• Take the proposed solution and release it to your audience. However,  
instead of letting every customer see it, release it only to a small subset of  
users.  
• Measure the performance of your solution for that audience. Compare it  
to the other group \(your control cohort\) and note the differences.  
• Did your new idea move the needle in the right direction? If it did, you’ve  
got a winning idea.  
• If not, you’ve got an audience of customers that might make good targets  
for further research. What did they think of the new experience? Would it  
make sense to reach out to them for some qualitative research?  
The tools for A/B testing are widely available and can be inexpensive. There  
are third-party commercial tools like Optimizely. There also are open source  
A/B testing frameworks available for every major platform. Regardless of the  
tools you choose, the trick is to make sure the changes you’re making are small  
CHAPTER 15\: FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH  
155 enough and the population you select is large enough that any change in  
behavior can be attributed with confidence to the change you’ve made. If you  
change too many things, any behavioral change cannot be directly attributed  
to your exact hypothesis.  
# Wrapping Up  
In this chapter, we covered many ways to validate your hypotheses. We looked  
at collaborative discovery and continuous learning techniques. We discussed  
how to build a weekly Lean testing process and covered what you should test  
and what to expect from those tests. We looked at ways to monitor your cus-  
tomer experience in a Lean UX context, and we touched on the power of A/B  
testing.  
These techniques, used in conjunction with the processes outlined in Chapter 4  
and Chapter 5, make up the full Lean UX process loop. Your goal is to get  
through this loop as often as possible, refining your thinking with each  
iteration.  
In the next section, we move away from process and take a look at how to  
integrate Lean UX into your organization. We’ll cover the organizational shifts  
you’ll need to make to support the Lean UX approach, whether you’re a  
startup, large company, or a digital agency.

# Integrating Lean UX and Agile  
Ask anyone at any organization what the default way of working is for them,  
and the answer will invariably be “We’re doing Agile!” Follow that question  
with “And how’s that working out for you?” and in most cases they’ll raise  
their hand and shake it from side to side in the “meh, it’s just OK” gesture.  
Agile was born of developers, 17 of them in fact, representing emerging ways  
of working that had emerged from their frustration with older engineering pro-  
cesses and the unpredictability of software development. At a weekend gather-  
ing in Utah in 2001, these software developers put together a series of princi-  
ples they called the Agile Manifesto.1 If you haven’t read it \(you should, it’s  
short\), you’d be surprised to find there isn’t much prescribed “process” in the  
Agile Manifesto. There’s nothing in there that says, “You shall stand up every  
day at 9\:15 with your team” or “You will work in two-week cycles called  
sprints.” Those are techniques taken from specific Agile methods, like Scrum  
and Extreme Programming \(XP\), methods that were invented by many of the  
folks who came together to create the Agile Manifesto itself. Instead of captur-  
ing specific practices, the authors of the Manifesto listed values and principles  
for highly collaborative, customer-centered software development. The most  
compelling line in the entire manifesto—and in our opinion the basis for true  
agility—is “\[We value\] responding to change over following a plan.”  
That’s the heart of it, really. If you work in a way that invites learning,  
embrace that learning in a humble manner, and change your plan based on  
what you’ve learned, you are being agile.  
1 “Manifesto for Agile Software Development,” accessed June 18, 2021, http\://agilemanifesto.org.  
157 In the 20 years since the Manifesto was created, this approach to doing work  
has become the default way of working in most organizations \(or at least, the  
default aspiration\). These Agile ideas reached well beyond software develop-  
ment teams and are now being applied to everything from strategic planning  
and leadership to human resources, finance, marketing, and, of course, design.  
The most well-known form of Agile is Scrum, a lightweight framework inven-  
ted primarily by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber in the mid-1990s. \(Yes,  
Scrum has been around longer than the Agile Manifesto.\) And yet for all its  
popularity, Scrum itself has only recently begun to think about how design fits  
into the process. Until as recently as November 2020, The Scrum Guide—the  
official documentation of Scrum—had never mentioned user experience or  
design in any way. As great design and customer-centricity become increasingly  
important success factors in technology products, designers and Agile practi-  
tioners alike have struggled to figure out exactly how to integrate themselves  
into Agile processes. While the rest of Lean UX describes an Agile way of  
working, this chapter will help answer some questions about how Lean UX fits  
into the mechanics of Agile methods, and, in particular, we’ll focus on design  
within the context of Scrum.  
# Make the Agile Process Your Own  
We often get asked how newly formed Agile teams should work. Should they  
use Scrum? Should they work in two-week sprints? What level of formality  
should they implement in order to be successful? With so many stories of frus-  
tration with Agile transformations, teams and leaders want to get it right as  
quickly as possible and minimize pain, frustration, and decreased productivity.  
You could spend the next 10 years reading all of the books on Scrum best  
practices, but when you boil it down to the core, you’re left with the following  
components, which make a great starting point for any team\:  
• Work in short cycles.  
• Deliver value at the end of each cycle.  
• Hold a brief daily planning meeting \(or Daily Scrum\).  
• Hold a retrospective after every cycle.  
You can spend a lot of time debating all of the other components of Scrum \(as  
well as the things people think are part of Scrum but are never mentioned in  
The Scrum Guide\), but these four basic elements provide all you need to  
increase the agility of your team. A team with a dedicated lineup will work  
together to figure out what they can get done in each cycle. They will meet  
daily to determine what the next most important set of things is to do, and,  
critically, they will review the efficacy of their process after every cycle.  
158  
LEAN UX In fact, it’s no exaggeration to say that retrospectives, when used properly, are  
the key to building a cohesive, cross-functional Agile team. Scrum doesn’t tell  
you how to fit designers or design work into a sprint or how to handle design  
work in the backlog, but if your team tries one way to build design into the  
Scrum process, runs that for a sprint or two, and then retrospects to determine  
how well that worked, you’ve begun the process of owning your Agile process.  
If you remove the prescriptive ethos of Scrum from the process and instead  
apply the philosophical lens of the Agile Manifesto, then you are, indeed,  
responding to change over following a plan. In this case, the plan is the rigid  
prescription of Agile process; the change you are responding to is your under-  
standing of how well that prescription worked for you and your team. If it  
works well, fantastic! Keep doing it. But if it failed to achieve what you hoped  
for, change course. Now you’re being Agile rather than just doing it.  
This is why retrospectives are so powerful and why they’re the one Scrum  
event we recommend more than any other. Honest, blameless retrospectives  
give a team a regular opportunity to adjust how they work. A retrospective  
looks back at the last cycle or two and asks, What has been working well?  
What hasn’t been working so well? What are we going to change moving for-  
ward? The best part of approaching a process this way is that the risk of  
changing your process is minimal. The longest you’ll have to live with a change  
is the length of your sprint. While this chapter will give you many ways to  
build an integrated Lean UX and Scrum process, whatever you do, make sure  
that you use retrospectives to examine what you do. If the techniques that we  
recommend don’t work for your team, change them, mix and match them, or  
throw them out. Your version of Agile \(or Scrum\) will be different than any  
other team’s. This is OK. In fact, we’d argue that’s the whole point of being  
agile.  
Redefining “Done”  
When is software done? We wrote about this in Chapter 3. When you’re work-  
ing to create an outcome, you need to ship software \(the output\) and then see  
if it creates the outcome you want. You can’t ship software until you’re  
“done.” But you’re not really finished until you’ve “validated” that software.  
In Scrum, nothing can go live to a user until it is “done.” This makes perfect  
sense. You need to make sure that the software you’re releasing meets certain  
shared quality standards \(what Scrum calls “the definition of done”\) and that  
it delivers the functionality that you and your team have planned \(what Scrum  
calls the “acceptance criteria”\). The definition of done is created by the team,  
and the acceptance criteria are usually set by the product manager or product  
owner. Together, these standards ensure that each piece of work is complete,  
works as designed, and is bug-free and stable enough to go to production. For  
most Scrum teams, though, this is the end of their involvement with that piece  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
159 of software. This end point, though, completely fails to take responsibility for  
outcomes and reflects a much older idea of the nature of software.  
When we started our careers, software came in a box. If that sounds weird to  
you, it might be even weirder to know that when Jeff was a kid, his dad would  
bring home the punch cards on which software came in the 1970s. In both of  
those cases, more than 20 years apart, software was static. It had an end state.  
We could package it in boxes or on paper cards. Fast-forward another 20  
years, and these concepts seem ridiculous now. Software doesn’t come in a box  
and is no longer static. Today we build systems that are updated continually  
and can be optimized indefinitely. It’s easy, today, to argue that software is  
never done. This makes the question “When are we done?” a difficult one to  
answer. But we need to answer it because it helps answer other, even more  
important questions. Do we move on to the next feature or not? Does the team  
get rewarded or chastised? Does the stakeholder get their bonus?  
Scrum, with its concepts of “acceptance criteria” and “definition of done,” has  
given teams a clear set of targets to hit. But those targets only go so far. As  
we’ve said, they ensure that the software “works as designed.” But “works as  
designed” only tells us that the software consistently does what we told it to  
do. Unfortunately, that’s not enough. We also need to know if the software cre-  
ated value. Did anyone find the feature we just shipped? Did they try it? Were  
they successful using it? Did they come back and use it again? Did they pay us  
for it? In other words, we need to know if it created an outcome.  
So how do our teams know when the work is finished? When do they know  
when to move on to the next initiative? We need to add a concept here\: the  
concept of “validated.” And getting to validated starts with our customers.  
We validate our work after it’s “done.” After it’s “accepted.” After it’s in the  
hands of our customers. We do this by measuring their behavior. We do this by  
listening to their needs and assessing if our features meet those needs, and then  
iterating until we meet those needs. Over and over again. It turns out designers  
are very good at doing this work.  
By expanding our idea of done from “works as designed” to “validated with  
customers,” we shift what Scrum teams are working toward. Instead of focus-  
ing on shipping features, they are focused on making customers successful.  
Design is an integral part of this, because design provides many of the tools  
needed to understand customers and refine solutions to better meet their needs.  
If a feature’s definition of done is reframed as an outcome, the team has no  
choice but to test early versions of their idea, interact with customers to  
understand how things can be improved, and design optimized versions of the  
feature to meet those ever-changing needs.  
160  
LEAN UX Here’s an example. Traditionally expressed acceptance criteria for a password  
authentication flow\:  
• Requires password entry  
• Password meets basic requirement guidelines  
• Password is entered correctly and user is verified into the system  
• Password recovery link is active  
• Error message displays when password is entered incorrectly  
• After three failed attempts, access is blocked  
Reframed criteria for the same feature\:  
• Percentage of users successfully authenticating on first try is 99% or higher  
• Number of password recovery attempts is reduced by 90%  
• Percentage of calls to the call center asking for password reset reduced by  
75%  
In the traditional example, the team builds and releases a set of features that  
work as designed. With the second definition, the team is not done until the  
customer is demonstrably more successful than they are today. This method  
reflects the modern nature of software and requires the intervention and inclu-  
sion of research, discovery, and design in the Scrum process. This recalibration  
of the team’s goal does not negate the value of traditional acceptance criteria.  
We still want to ship stable, high-quality, high-performance, secure code to  
production. However, that’s not enough. Those attributes are table stakes.  
None of that matters if it doesn’t make the customer more successful.  
We’re Still Doing Staggered Sprints. Why?  
In May 2007, Desiree Sy published “Adapting Usability Investigations for  
Agile User-Centered Design” in the Journal of Usability Studies.  
2 Sy is one of  
the first people to try to combine Agile and UX, and many of us were excited  
by the solutions she was proposing. In the 2007 article, Sy describes in detail  
her idea of a productive integration of Agile and user-centered design. She  
called it cycle 0 \(though it has come to be referred to popularly as either  
“sprint zero” or sometimes “staggered sprints”\).  
2 Desirée Sy, “Adapting Usability Investigations for Agile User-Centered Design,” Journal of Usa-  
bility Studies 2, no. 3 \(May 2007\)\: 112–132, https\://oreil.ly/Bhxq1.  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
161 In short, Sy, along with Lynn Miller, described a process in which design activ-  
ity takes place one sprint ahead of development. Work is designed and valida-  
ted during the “design sprint” and then passed off into the development stream  
to be implemented during the development sprint, as is illustrated in  
Figure 16-1.  
Figure 16-1. Sy and Miller’s “Staggered Sprints” model  
Many teams have misinterpreted this model, though. Sy always advocated  
strong collaboration between designers and developers during both the design  
and development sprints. Many teams have missed this critical point and  
instead have created workflows in which designers and developers communi-  
cate by handoff—creating a kind of mini-waterfall process.  
For teams transitioning from waterfall to Agile, there’s a benefit to working  
this way. It teaches you to work in shorter cycles and to divide your work into  
sequential pieces. However, this model works best as a transition. It is not  
where you want your team to end up.  
Here’s why\: it becomes very easy to create a situation in which the entire team  
is never working on the same thing at the same time. You never realize the ben-  
efits of cross-functional collaboration because the different disciplines are  
focused on different things. Without that collaboration, you don’t build shared  
understanding, so you end up relying heavily on documentation and handoffs  
for communication.  
There’s another reason this process is less than ideal\: it can create unnecessary  
waste. You waste time creating documentation to describe what happened dur-  
ing the design sprints. And if developers haven’t participated in the design  
sprint, they haven’t had a chance to assess the work for feasibility or scope.  
That conversation doesn’t happen until handoff. Can they actually build the  
specified designs in the next two weeks? If not, the work that went into design-  
ing those elements is wasted.  
162  
LEAN UX Despite these drawbacks, many teams still work in staggered sprints today. In  
our experience, there are several potential root causes for this\:  
Design team is not integrated into the “dev” process  
In many companies, design is still a shared service operating as an internal  
agency. Designers aren’t assigned to a specific Scrum team. They are seen  
as a dependency for the software development work to start. By having  
designers work a sprint ahead, the design work can “feed the machine” of  
software development.  
Software development is outsourced  
Some organizations still outsource their software development. In a world  
where software is the engine of business and growth, this is a staggeringly  
risky Achilles’ heel. Nevertheless, if the coding is being done by a third-  
party provider, they will want to see “final” designs before they estimate  
and start the work. Staggered sprints make that possible for teams that  
work with outsourced partners.  
Cargo cult Agile  
Some organizations have brought in Agile processes to increase the effi-  
ciency and productivity of software development, not for the ability to  
change course based on new learnings and insights. In this case, the orga-  
nization operates as a software factory, churning out features as fast as  
possible. While the work may be chunked up into sprints and Agile  
vocabulary used throughout the organization, the priority is still to simply  
ship features. These organizations typically focus on deadlines and rarely  
take the time to iterate and improve features through feedback and valida-  
tion. Staggered sprints provide the feature factory with fodder for produc-  
tion. Collaboration between designers and developers is minimal, as hand-  
offs and deliverables still form the foundation for conversation between  
them.  
Staggered sprints are a symptom of an organization that hasn’t fully embraced  
agility. Their use is a stepping-stone in the right direction but a clear indication  
that the team hasn’t arrived yet. Your goal should be to build greater collabo-  
ration and transparency between designers and developers while reducing the  
waste of document handoffs, lengthy design reviews, and feature negotiations.  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
163Dual-Track Agile  
Dual-track Agile is a model that integrates product discovery and delivery  
work into one process for the same team. This is the most successful model  
we’ve seen to date for bringing Lean UX work successfully into the Agile pro-  
cess. In many ways, dual-track Agile is what Sy and Miller were trying to con-  
vey with their staggered-sprint model. However, for dual-track Agile to work,  
one team must do both kinds of work—discovery \(Lean UX\) and delivery.  
Some teams interpret dual-track Agile as two types of work for two separate  
groups of people.  
We don’t like this model primarily because it divides the product development  
team into smaller \(or, worse, separate\) squads who then inevitably have to  
come back together to build a shared understanding. In practice, we’ve seen  
teams run into the following problems\:  
Separate discovery and delivery teams\: One antipattern we’ve witnessed several  
times is teams splitting up who does the discovery and who does the delivery  
on their team. Often the UX designer and/or the product manager take on the  
bulk of the discovery work. The engineers are delegated early delivery work.  
This effectively recreates the mini-waterfalls of staggered sprints, as described  
earlier. The shared understanding breaks down, slowing the pace of decision-  
making and reducing the team’s cohesion, productivity, and learning.  
Limited knowledge of how to do discovery\: Building a dual-track Agile process  
assumes that your team knows how to do discovery. There are many tools that  
you can use to build feedback loops into a discovery backlog. Without a  
broader knowledge of these tools, teams resort to the ones they’re most famil-  
iar with and often pick suboptimal tactics for learning. If you have access to  
researchers, try to add them to your team. At the very least, seek out their  
input as new discovery initiatives begin. Seasoned practitioners can teach your  
team the best method for your needs and can help you plan your discovery  
work.  
Not feeding back evidence from the delivery work to the discovery backlog\:  
This challenge is symptomatic of an organization that is still thinking incre-  
mentally. After a feature makes it from discovery to delivery, the team will  
implement it as designed and ship it. The great thing about this is that, as soon  
as it’s live, this new feature begins to provide a new set of data about how well  
it’s working and where to focus your next discovery activities. You just have to  
pay attention—and get the team to pay attention. Make sure that your team is  
continuing to collect feedback on shipped features and using that information  
to regularly assess the prioritization of their discovery work.  
164  
LEAN UX Dual-track works when it’s one team  
The best way to think of dual-track is that it’s two types of work—product dis-  
covery and product delivery—performed by one team \(Figure 16-2\). Discovery  
work consists of active learning through design and research activities, as well  
as passive learning through inbound analytics of features and products already  
in the market. In order to build shared understanding, we strive to have as  
many team members participate in each activity as possible. The quantity of  
discovery and delivery work will fluctuate from sprint to sprint. This is nor-  
mal, and you can anticipate this as you make plans.  
Figure 16-2. Dual-rack Agile works when it’s one team.  
Image concept\: Gary Pedretti and Pawel Mysliwiec  
If you’re doing discovery work right, you’re changing and potentially killing a  
lot of ideas. We don’t do discovery work simply to validate every feature we  
have in our backlog. Instead, we’re testing and learning, and sometimes that  
means we kill features before we ship them. Again, this is being agile and it’s  
exactly the reason Agile was conceived in the first place. Without discovery  
work, Agile ends up just being the engine of the software factory.  
Planning dual-track work  
Over years of practice, we’ve tried many different ways of accounting for both  
types of work in the Scrum process. We’ve tried to carve out a specific amount  
of time in each sprint for discovery work to take place, but that was unsatisfy-  
ing, because in some sprints there was none to be done, while in others it was  
the bulk of the work. We’ve tried Marty Cagan’s approach of dividing the  
work between disciplines \(design and PMs do the discovery, engineers do the  
delivery\), but the overhead of handoffs, negotiations, and debates reduced the  
team’s ability to respond to change. Overall, we’ve found that ensuring the  
entire team shifts its workload depending on the current sprint’s needs is the  
best option. In fact, it is the most agile option. It allows the team to adjust its  
activities based on what it’s learning, thereby ensuring that the most important  
work happens next. Sometimes that work is discovery, and other times it’s  
delivery.  
To make dual-track Agile successful and to bring Lean UX into the daily work-  
flow of your Scrum team, there are some structural elements that are critical to  
that integration delivering the results your team seeks.  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
165 A dedicated designer on every team\: There is no compromise here. Without a  
dedicated designer on the Scrum team, what you have is a software engineering  
team. While that team will absolutely deliver a user experience, it will not be  
of the same level of quality without a designer’s input. What’s more, that team  
will be lacking the skills to do good discovery work\: they will focus exclusively  
on writing code. As we mentioned before, the production of code is no longer  
the goal for great digital product development—it’s the means to an end. The  
goal is to produce meaningful changes in the behaviors of our customers.  
Without a deep understanding of the customer and how to best serve those  
needs, your product will fail. Designers bring that to the team.  
Design and discovery work is a first-class citizen of the backlog\: The short of it  
is this\: one backlog. Development work, QA work, design work, research  
work, you name it — it all goes on one backlog, prioritized together with the  
same team doing all of that work. As soon as the work is divided between  
more than one backlog, the team will look to one of them as the “primary”  
one and the other\(s\) will go neglected. You can and should have both tracks of  
the work managed in the same backlog. You can certainly differentiate the dif-  
ferent types of work in your backlog \(see experiment stories, below\), but it all  
must end up in the same project management tool, no matter whether you use  
a physical Scrum board or JIRA or something else.  
Using one backlog and treating all work in the same way ensures the team  
understands that all of these components are necessary for the success of your  
product. It visualizes the Lean UX work in a way that puts it on the same level  
as software development work \(which is always weighted the highest in our  
experience\). It also highlights the trade-offs that will need to be made in order  
for the discovery work to take place.  
Often this will bring up questions of velocity. “Won’t we reduce our velocity if  
we do all this discovery work?” If you’re only measuring the velocity of deliv-  
ery, then the answer is yes. Mature dual-track teams measure both the velocity  
of delivery as well as the velocity of discovery \(or learning\). These teams real-  
ize that, as the quantity of learning work increases, it will inevitably reduce the  
quantity of delivery. This is because the same group of people is doing both  
types of work. This is also OK, because at the end of the day, we’re trying to  
maximize how effective the team is, and we do that by tracking outcomes, not  
by tracking how many stories it completes or how much software it builds.  
166  
LEAN UX There are a couple of ways to represent Lean UX work in your backlog. \(See  
Figure 16-3.\) You can represent it as a standalone story. \(The Scrum Guide  
calls stories Product Backlog Items or PBIs.\) Or you can integrate the work  
into the story itself, ensuring that no feature gets shipped without discovery  
and design work taking place.  
Figure 16-3. Common patterns to manage UX work in the backlog  
Cross-functional participation in learning activities\: Lean UX brings with it  
many types of learning activities. These activities may be led by designers or  
researchers or even product managers, but they should be practiced and atten-  
ded by the entire team. The more the team can learn together, the less time is  
spent sharing and debating the learning and more time can be spent deciding  
what to do about the things we’ve learned. This latter is a far more productive  
conversation and use of the team’s time. We’re not saying that every team  
member needs to take part in every research activity. We do think that every-  
one should participate to some degree, and that participation should be a regu-  
lar part of their work activity—not a special event.  
Make participating in the discovery process the path of least resistance. Broad-  
cast your customer conversations internally so others can watch from their  
desks. If a colleague is uncomfortable speaking with a customer, bring them  
along and make them the notetaker. Measure what Jared Spool refers to as  
“exposure hours.”3 Exposure hours is a measure of the amount of time each  
member of your team is directly exposed to users. Make sure each member of  
3 Jared M. Spool, “Fast Path to a Great UX – Increased Exposure Hours,” Center Centre UIE,

CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
167 your team spends at least a two-hour block of time every six weeks in direct  
contact with customers. This could be two hours in the call center taking or  
listening to calls. It could be two hours in the store or on the factory floor  
watching customers and users. Or it could be doing face-to-face sales of your  
product in public settings. These activities build empathy, and that in turn  
drives curiosity. The more curiosity the entire team has about whether or not  
they are truly meeting customer needs, the greater the likelihood of Lean UX  
activities ending up on your backlog.  
# Exploiting the Rhythms of Scrum to Build a Lean UX  
# Practice  
Over the years, we’ve found some useful ways to integrate Lean UX  
approaches with the rhythms of Scrum. Let’s take a look at how you can use  
Scrum’s meeting cadence and Lean UX to build an efficient process.  
One approach we put together was to ask teams to map Lean UX activities  
over a diagram of the Scrum framework to help them bring the integration of  
the practices into greater focus. We share a typical attempt in Figure 16-4. We  
think this is a pretty good attempt, but we’d encourage you to try this with  
your team. As you review it, remember the following caveats\:  
• This is by no means a comprehensive listing of design activities. There  
aren’t enough Post-its \(digital or otherwise\) in the world to cover that.  
• We use the word Design \(often with a capital D\) to serve as an umbrella  
term for all activities that designers of all kinds normally do or take part  
in.  
As with every recommendation in this book, this is a starting point. It shows  
you how to layer existing activities on top of Scrum. Try it. See what works for  
you and your team and then adjust based on what you decide during your ret-  
rospectives.

CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
169Sprint Goals, Product Goals, and Multi-Sprint Themes  
Let’s assume your organization has decided on a specific strategic focus for the  
next two quarters. Your team decides to use a risky hypothesis as the first  
attempt to achieve the strategy. You can use that hypothesis to create a multi-  
sprint theme that guides the work you’ll do over the next set of sprints. Scrum  
calls these themes “Product Goals.” \(Think of a Product Goal as a multi-sprint  
theme that you use to connect a sequence of sprints.\) Your measures of success  
for your theme are outcomes, as demonstrated in Figure 16-5.  
Figure 16-5. Sprints tied together with a theme or product goal  
Kick off the theme with a collaborative design  
Start work on each theme by using the Lean UX Canvas and perhaps a Design  
Studio exercise.4 \(See Figure 16-6.\) Depending on the scope of the hypothesis,  
the collaborative design session can be as short as an afternoon or as long as a  
week. You can do them with your immediate team, but you should include a  
broader group if it’s a larger-scale effort. The point of this kickoff is to get the  
entire team sketching, ideating, and speaking to customers together, creating a  
backlog of ideas from which to test and learn. In addition, this activity will  
help define the scope of your theme a bit better—assuming that you’ve built in  
some customer feedback loops.  
Figure 16-6. The Lean UX Canvas can capture your sprint theme  
After you’ve started your regular sprints, you will be testing and validating  
your ideas\: new insights will come in, and you’ll need to decide what to do  
4 You could even use a Google-style “design sprint” here—a confusing name in this context. In  
this case, we’re not advocating for spending a whole sprint doing design. Instead, we’re advocat-  
ing for the process named “design sprint,” which we describe in Chapter 14.  
170  
LEAN UX with them. You make these decisions by running subsequent shorter brain-  
storming sessions and collaborative discovery activities as each new sprint  
begins \(Figure 16-7\). This allows the team to use the latest insight to create the  
backlog for the next sprint.  
Figure 16-7. Timing and scope of sketching and ideation sessions  
Sprint planning meeting  
Bring your Lean UX Canvas to the sprint planning meeting. Bring the output  
of your design sprint too. Your mess of sticky notes, sketches, wireframes,  
paper prototypes, and any other artifacts might seem useless to outside observ-  
ers but will be meaningful to your team. You made these artifacts together, and  
because of that you have the shared understanding necessary to extract stories  
from them. Use them in your planning meeting to write user stories together,  
and then estimate and prioritize the stories. \(See Figure 16-8.\)  
Figure 16-8. Hold sprint planning meetings immediately after brainstorming sessions  
Experiment stories  
As you plan your iteration, there might be additional discovery work that  
needs to be done during the iteration that wasn’t covered in the design sprint  
or collaborative discovery activities. To accommodate this in your sprint  
cadence and capture all the work in the same backlog, use experiment stories.  
Captured by using the same method as your user stories, experiment stories  
have two distinct benefits\:  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
171 They visualize discovery work  
Discovery work is not inherently tangible as delivery work can be. Experi-  
ment stories solve that by leveling the playing field. Everything your team  
works on—discovery or delivery—goes on the backlog as a story.  
They force its prioritization against delivery work\:  
After those stories are in the backlog, you need to put them in priority  
order. This forces conversations around when to run the experiment and,  
equally as important, what we won’t be working on during that same  
time.  
Experiment stories look just like user stories, as illustrated in Figure 16-9.  
Figure 16-9. Experiment stories  
Experiment stories contain the following elements\:  
• The hypothesis you’re testing or the thing you’re trying to learn  
• Tactic\(s\) for learning \(e.g., customer interviews, A/B tests, and prototypes\)  
• Who will do the work  
• A level of effort estimate \(if you do estimations\) for how much work you  
expect this to be  
After they are written, experiment stories go into your backlog. When their  
time comes up in the sprint, that’s the assigned person’s main focus. When the  
experiment is over, bring the findings to the team immediately and discuss  
them to determine the impact of these findings. Your team should be ready to  
172  
LEAN UX change course, even within the current sprint, if the outcome of the experiment  
stories reveals insights that invalidate your current prioritization.  
Pro tip\: sometimes we know there will be discovery work to do, but its exact  
shape or format is unclear at the beginning of a sprint. To ensure the team will  
have bandwidth for this work during the sprint, place a blank experiment  
story into your backlog. As the discovery work reveals itself during the sprint,  
fill it out with details and prioritize appropriately. If it ends up going unused,  
that’s a bit more breathing room your team has during that sprint. Everyone  
wins.  
User validation schedule  
Finally, to ensure that you have a constant stream of customer feedback to use  
for your experiments, plan user research sessions every single week. \(See  
Figure 16-10.\) This way your team is never more than five business days away  
from customer feedback and has ample time to react prior to the end of the  
sprint. This weekly research cadence provides a good rhythm for your experi-  
ment stories and a natural learning point in the sprint.  
Use the artifacts you created in the ideation sessions as the base material for  
your user tests. Remember that when the ideas are raw, you are testing for  
value. \(That is, do people want to use my product rather than can people use  
my product?\) After you have established that there is a desire for your product,  
subsequent tests with higher-fidelity artifacts will reveal whether your solution  
is usable.  
Figure 16-10. Conversations with users happen during every sprint  
Designers Must Participate in Planning  
Agile methods can create a lot of time pressure on designers. Some work fits  
easily into the context of a user story. Other work needs more time to get it  
right. Two-week cycles of concurrent development and design offer few oppor-  
tunities for designers to ruminate on big problems. And although some Agile  
methods take a more flexible approach to time than Scrum does \(for example,  
Kanban does away with the notion of a two-week batch of work and places  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
173 the emphasis on continuous flow\), most designers feel pressure to fit their work  
into the time box of the sprint. For this reason, designers need to participate in  
the sprint planning process.  
The major reason designers feel pressure in Agile processes is that they don’t  
\(for whatever reason\) fully participate in the process. This is typically not their  
fault\: when Agile is understood as simply a way to build software, there  
doesn’t appear to be any reason to include nontechnologists in the process.  
However, without designer participation, their concerns and needs are not  
taken into account in project plans. As a result, many Agile teams don’t make  
plans that allow designers to do their best work.  
For Lean UX to work, the entire team must participate in all activities—stand-  
ups, retrospectives, planning meetings, brainstorming sessions—as a normal  
rule, they all require everyone’s attendance to be successful. Besides negotiating  
the complexity of certain features, cross-functional participation allows design-  
ers and developers to create effective backlog prioritization.  
For example, imagine at the beginning of a sprint that the first story a team  
prioritizes has a heavy design component to it. Imagine that the designer was  
not there to voice their concern. That team will fail as soon as they meet for  
their stand-up the next day. The designer will call out that the story has not  
been designed. The designer will say that it will take at least two to three days  
to complete the design before the story is ready for development. Imagine  
instead that the designer had participated in the prioritization of the backlog.  
Their concern would have been raised at planning time. The team could have  
selected a story card that needed less design preparation to work on first—  
which would have bought the designer the time they needed to complete the  
work.  
The other casualty of sparse participation is shared understanding. Teams  
make decisions in meetings. Those decisions are based on discussions. Even if  
90% of a meeting is not relevant to your immediate need, the 10% that is rele-  
vant will save hours of time downstream. Participation gives you the ability to  
negotiate for the time you need to do your work. This is true for UX designers  
as much as it is for everyone else on the team.  
# Stakeholders and the Risks Dashboard  
Management check-ins are one of the biggest obstacles to maintaining team  
momentum. Designers are used to doing design reviews, but unfortunately,  
check-ins don’t end there. Product owners, stakeholders, CEOs, and clients all  
want to know how things are going. They all want to bless the project plan  
going forward. The challenge for outcome-focused teams is that their project  
plans are dependent on what they are learning. They are responsive, so their  
174  
LEAN UX typical plan lays out only small batches of work at a time. At most, these  
teams plan an iteration or two ahead. This perceived “short-sightedness” tends  
not to satisfy most high-level managers, which can lead to micromanagement.  
How then do you keep the check-ins under control while maintaining the pace  
of your Lean UX and Scrum processes?  
Two words\: proactive communication.  
Jeff once managed a team that radically altered the workflow for an existing  
product that had thousands of paying customers. The team was so excited by  
the changes they’d made that they went ahead with the launch without alerting  
anyone else in the organization. Within an hour of the new product going live,  
the vice president of customer service was at Jeff’s desk, fuming and demand-  
ing to know why she wasn’t told of this change. The issue was this\: when cus-  
tomers have problems with the product, they call in for help. Call center repre-  
sentatives use scripts to troubleshoot customer problems and to offer solutions  
—except they didn’t have a script for this new product. Because they didn’t  
know it was going to change.  
This healthy slice of humble pie served as a valuable lesson. If you want your  
stakeholders—both those managing you and those dependent on you—to stay  
out of your way, make sure that they are aware of your plans and your pro-  
gress. While working together at our agency Neo, our colleague Nicole Rufuku  
came up with a remarkably simple and powerful tool for doing just this\: the  
Risks Dashboard \(Figure 16-11\).  
Figure 16-11. The Risks Dashboard  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
175 The Risks Dashboard is nothing more than a three-column chart you can cre-  
ate in PowerPoint, Excel, or Google Docs.  
• The first column lists the major outstanding risks associated with your cur-  
rent initiative. These are things that are critical to the success of the  
product.  
• The middle column has a scale of how severe this risk might be and a  
color-coded display of how that risk is trending. Is it something that might  
require a small fix? Or is it existential to the success of the product? Is our  
discovery work telling us that this is increasingly possible or not as bad as  
we thought?  
• The third column tells what we’re doing about that risk.  
This dashboard is a living document that you use to communicate with your  
stakeholders and clients about the status of your project. Use this dashboard in  
your planning meetings with your team. Use it in your sprint demos with your  
stakeholders to help drive important decisions. In doing so, you are informing  
your stakeholders about\:  
• How the work is progressing  
• What you have learned so far  
• What risk you’ll focus on next  
• Outcomes \(how you’re trending toward your goal\) not feature sets  
• Dependent departments \(customer service, marketing, operations, etc.\) and  
their need to be aware of upcoming changes that can affect them  
Often there will be a risk in the dashboard where the third column is empty. A  
stakeholder will then ask why we’re not doing anything about this risk. Some-  
times this is simply a matter of prioritization. But sometimes you may be  
blocked on progress. So a stakeholder question gives you a perfect opportunity  
to bring up any challenges you may have in doing discovery work, prioritizing  
it, or getting budget or approval to do it. With the Risks Dashboard, you are  
effectively contextualizing the discovery with business impact. Business impact  
tends to resonate powerfully with stakeholders, which makes this an effective  
tool to drive a better integration of your Lean UX work with your Agile deliv-  
ery process.  
176  
LEAN UX Outcome-Based Road Maps  
One of the biggest challenges in Agile is planning the work in a linear, visual  
way. Sure, we’ve had “road maps” for a long time, but they don’t do a great  
job of representing the true nature of software development. Digital product  
development is not linear. It is iterative. We build some things. We ship them.  
We see how they impact customer behavior. We iterate them and ship again.  
The traditional linear road map model—one where there is a starting point  
and a clear, feature-specific end point \(almost always with a fixed date\)—is  
outdated. It reflects an output-focused mode of operating a digital business.  
Instead, as we’ve discussed throughout this book, successful product-led  
organizations focus on outcomes. How then do we build product road maps in  
a world of continuous improvement, learning, and agility? And how can this  
type of visualization ensure that Lean UX takes place in our Agile process? We  
use outcome-based road maps.  
Here is what an Agile product road map should look like \(Figure 16-12\).  
Figure 16-12. An Agile product road map  
You’ll notice a few key components in this diagram\:  
Strategic themes  
These are the organizational product strategies set by executive leaders  
that point teams in a specific direction. These can be things like “Expand  
our market share in Europe” or “Leverage the under-utilized time our fleet  
isn’t ferrying passengers to deliver other goods and food.” There can be  
multiple themes running in parallel for a larger organization.  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
177 Quarterly OKR goals  
OKRs, when done well, use customer behavior as the metrics in the “key  
results” part of the equation. These quarterly outcome goals are where  
each team is going to focus in an effort to help achieve the strategic theme.  
This is the goal teams strive to achieve. It is their definition of success and  
their real definition of done. Teams should work together with leadership  
to ensure these are aligned and properly levelled.  
Feature/product hypotheses  
These are each team’s best guesses as to how they will achieve this quar-  
ter’s OKR goals. Looking one quarter in advance, a team can make strong,  
well-educated guesses about what product or feature ideas they think will  
achieve their quarterly goals. Looking out two quarters ahead, those  
guesses become less confident, so teams will make fewer guesses and fewer  
commitments. Looking three and four quarters out, the teams really have  
no idea what they’ll be working on, so these guesses become fewer and  
fewer. This is exactly the way it should be. Teams will learn in the next  
quarter or two how well their ideas worked, what moves the needles for-  
ward, and what their next guesses should be. The boxes for Q3 and Q4  
will fill up as learning from Q1 and Q2 gets synthesized and acted on.  
Visualizing work this way immediately puts the uncertainty of software devel-  
opment front and center in the conversation. When stakeholders ask, “How  
will we determine whether these are the right hypotheses to work on now and  
in the future?” the answer is Lean UX. Your team will work to build learning  
into every sprint to ensure you’re always working toward the strategic theme  
and not wasting time on initiatives that don’t bring you closer. Couple that  
with the Agile cadences described above, and you have a powerful recipe for  
delivering valuable experiences to your customers.  
Frequency of Review  
Each team should present this type of outcome-based road map for review at  
the beginning of an annual cycle. It should align with the strategic goals leader-  
ship has set and ensure their OKRs use metrics that ladder up to these goals.  
While it’s incumbent on the team to continually expose what they are doing,  
learning, and deciding, official check-ins should happen on a quarterly basis.  
Teams meet with leaders to determine how well they’ve tracked toward their  
outcome goals, what they’ve learned during the last quarter, and what they  
plan on doing in the next quarter. This is a perfect opportunity to reaffirm the  
validity of the team’s goals going forward and to make any adjustments based  
on new learnings, market conditions, or any other factor that may have affec-  
ted the direction of the company.  
178  
LEAN UXMeasuring Progress  
It should be clear by now that progress on this type of road map is not meas-  
ured in how many features have been delivered or whether they’ve been deliv-  
ered on time. Instead, progress is measured in terms of how well we’ve  
changed customer behavior for the better. If our ideas didn’t drive customer  
success, we kill those ideas and move on to new ones. The learning drives ideas  
for future quarterly backlogs. It also drives our agility as a team and as a  
business.  
These road maps are living documents. We don’t fix these at the beginning of  
an annual cycle and leave them as if they were etched in stone. There is too  
much uncertainty and complexity in delivering digital products and services.  
Product-led organizations — those focused on customer success with empow-  
ered teams — work to make sure that they’re always pointed in the right direc-  
tion. This means adjusting road maps as the reality on the ground changes.  
Outcome-based road maps ensure that leaders and teams are being transparent  
with each other, realistic about their goals, and most importantly realistic  
about how they measure success.  
# Lean UX and Agile in the Enterprise  
Many of the tactics covered in this book are focused on one team. But in the  
real world, large organizations have multiple product development teams  
working in parallel. How does Lean UX scale when the number of teams  
grows to tens or even hundreds of concurrent workstreams?  
This is one version of the scaling question—which is itself an ongoing question  
in the Agile community. As Lean and Agile methods have become the default  
ways of working, many people have become focused on this question. Large  
organizations have a legitimate need to coordinate the activity of multiple  
teams, and processes that embrace uncertainty and embrace learning-your-  
way-forward present a challenge to most traditional project management  
methods.  
Let’s address the elephant in the room—the Scaled Agile Framework or SAFe.  
As of this writing, SAFe has been around for 10 years, and for many large  
organizations, it’s the first choice for implementing a whole-organization  
approach to agility. If you’re not familiar with it, SAFe is a comprehensive,  
detailed, hierarchical set of processes, diagrams, and vocabulary that are all  
designed to increase the agility of large organizations. It works in a top-down  
way to divide and delegate the work to “Agile Release Trains” who follow a  
rigid release schedule. Unfortunately, these processes are largely devoid of user  
feedback or learning.  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
179 You might have been as surprised, as we were, to learn that version 4.5 of the  
SAFe framework included Lean UX. Because of this, we get many questions  
about how to do Lean UX in a company that has implemented SAFe. The  
short answer is this\: you can’t. SAFe is designed for production, not for discov-  
ery. It is optimized to ensure a continuous flow of output and minimize change  
requirements on executives. It creates a rigidity within the software develop-  
ment process that results in something that can’t, in any real way, be described  
as agile.  
SAFe Is Not Agile  
Ever since the Scaled Agile Framework \(SAFe for short\) adopted Lean UX in version 4.5,  
we’ve received a steady stream of inbound questions about how, exactly, these two  
methods are supposed to work well together.  
The short answer is, we have no idea.  
The slightly longer answer is that all the principles we’ve built into Lean UX don’t seem  
to exist in SAFe.  
Continuous learning and improvement, customer centricity, humility, cross-functional  
collaboration, evidence-based decision making, experimentation, design, and course  
correction—to name a few—are visibly absent from the SAFe conversation. Instead,  
organizations adopting this way of working focus on rigid team structures, strict rituals  
and events, and an uneven distribution of behavior change requirements depending  
on how high up one sits in the organization.  
In short, SAFe is not agile.  
Given the heavy training regimen teams have to go through to become “SAFe certi-  
fied,” it’s no wonder they resist change. They’ve been trained to work in a very specific  
way—a way focused solely on predictable delivery, not learning, not course correction,  
and certainly not agility. The activities that make teams truly agile require flexibility in  
planning. They require alignment on customer success, not a predetermined set of fea-  
tures. They require a continuous discovery process that inevitably leads to unplanned  
course corrections. These corrections would “derail” a Release Train in no time.  
Large organizations seeking agility realize the uncertainty that comes with it and cling  
to the familiarity of waterfall processes. SAFe gives the illusion of “adopting agile” while  
allowing familiar management processes to remain intact. In a world of rapid continu-  
ous change, evolving consumer consumption patterns, geopolitical instability, and  
exponential technological advancements, this way of working is unsustainable.  
If you work in a large organization that has adopted or is in the process of implement-  
ing SAFe, ask yourself what’s changed during this transition. Are you closer to your cus-  
tomers? How long does it take to learn whether you’ve delivered something of value?  
Even better, how are you measuring “value”? Ask yourself how easy it would be to pivot  
an initiative based on a new discovery? Then compare those answers to how things  
were before you started using terms like “big room planning,” “PI,” and “release train  
engineer.”  
180  
LEAN UX Scaling any way of working in a large organization is tricky and uneven. Attempting to  
apply one blanket process to the entire company—a process that is focused strictly on  
delivery rather than continuous discovery and course correction—only hardens tradi-  
tional ways of working. SAFe is compelling because it seems to offer a one-size-fits-all  
recipe for agility at scale. In reality, it rewards predictability, conformity, and compli-  
ance while providing executives with cover for the question “How do we become more  
agile?”  
A full discussion of how to create a truly Agile and Lean organization is  
beyond the scope of this book.5 And honestly, it’s a hard problem with few  
easy answers. It requires leadership to radically rethink the way it sets strategy,  
assembles teams, and plans and assigns work. In essence, organizations need to  
reduce the amount of scaffolding they put in place and allow teams to organi-  
cally find ways to use the basic values, principles, and methods of small-team  
Agile to build a productive working cadence and then scale those organization-  
specific approaches in small increments.  
That said, there are a few techniques that can help Lean UX scale in enterprise  
Agile environments and even take advantage of that scale. Here are just a few  
issues that typically arise and ways to manage for them.  
Issue\: projects grow bigger, more teams are assigned to them. How do you  
ensure that all teams are aligned to the same vision and not optimizing locally?  
Solution approach\: The concept of managing with outcomes applies to a set of  
teams as much as it does to individual ones. To ensure that all the teams work-  
ing on the same project have a shared vision, assign them all the same success  
metric, expressed as an outcome. Working together, they can define the leading  
indicators that drive that metric and divide those leading metrics between the  
teams on the project. But teams must not be allowed to focus on leading met-  
rics to the exclusion of the larger outcome\: the entire set of teams succeeds  
only if they hit the overarching outcome together.  
Working together this way reduces the risk of local optimization with disre-  
gard for follow-on impacts of that optimization. For example, if the marketing  
team is working to hit their acquisition outcomes goals but overutilize email to  
achieve that goal, it may hurt the product team’s retention goal. If both of  
these teams had the same outcome goals—a mix of acquisition and retention—  
they would work together to learn how to balance their efforts and outputs to  
be successful.  
5 We’ve written a high-level overview of this subject in our book Sense & Respond \(Harvard Busi-  
ness Review Press, 2017\). \(See https\://senseandrespond.co.\)  
CHAPTER 16\: INTEGRATING LEAN UX AND AGILE  
181 Issue\: How do you ensure that teams are sharing what they’re learning and  
minimizing duplicate effort to learn the same things?  
Solution approach\: Although there’s no silver bullet to solve for this issue, the  
successful practices we’ve seen include a central knowledge management tool  
\(like a wiki\), regular team leadership meetings \(like a Scrum of Scrums\), and  
open-communication tools that focus on research \(like a dedicated channel on  
Slack or your internal chat tool\). Elements from studio culture, like regular  
cross-team critique sessions, can help too.  
Issue\: Cross-team dependencies can keep progress at a crawl. How do you  
maintain a regular pace of learning and delivery in a multiteam environment?  
Solution approach\: Create self-sufficient “full-stack” teams. Full-stack teams  
have every capability needed for them to do their work on the team. This  
doesn’t mean that they need a person from each department—just that there is  
someone on the team who can do one or more of the things the team might  
need. The specific disciplines on the team—designers, content people, frontend  
developers, backend developers, product managers—coordinate with one  
another at discipline-specific meetings to ensure that they are up to date on  
their practice, but the work takes place locally.  
# Wrapping Up  
This chapter took a detailed look at how Lean UX fits into an Agile process. In  
addition, we looked at how cross-functional collaboration allows a team to  
move forward at a brisk pace, and how to handle stakeholders and managers  
who always want to know what’s going on. We discussed why having everyone  
participate in all activities is critical and how the staggered-sprint model, once  
considered the path to true agility, formed the roots of dual-track Agile, which  
is now the new target model for most teams. We also covered, in detail, how  
scrum artifacts and events work to your advantage in building up your velocity  
of learning.

# ORGANIZATION  
# About Part IV  
Integrating design into Agile is never easy. Sometimes it causes a lot of pain  
and heartache. Jeff learned that firsthand when he was at TheLadders. After  
spending some time trying to integrate UX work with an Agile process, Jeff  
was feeling pretty good—until one morning his UX team delivered the diagram  
below \(Figure IV-1\). This diagram visualized all of the challenges the team was  
facing as they tried to integrate their practice into Agile. It served initially as a  
large slice of humble pie. Ultimately, though, it provided the beginning of con-  
versations that helped Jeff, his UX team, and the rest of TheLadders’ product  
development staff build an integrated, collaborative practice.  
183 Figure IV-1. The UX team at TheLadders expressed their feelings about  
our Agile/UX integration efforts  
184  
LEAN UX In the years since this diagram was created, we’ve been fortunate to work with  
lots of companies on this challenge. We’ve worked with companies that span-  
ned a broad range of industries, company sizes, and cultures. We’ve helped  
media organizations figure out new ways to deliver and monetize their content.  
We’ve built new, mobile-first sales tools for a commercial furniture manufac-  
turer. We’ve consulted with fashion retailers, automotive services companies,  
and large banks to help them build Lean UX practices. We’ve worked with  
nonprofits to create new service offerings. And we’ve trained countless teams.  
Each of these projects provided us a bit more insight into how Lean UX works  
in that environment. We used that insight to make each subsequent project  
that much more successful. We’ve built up a body of knowledge over the past  
five years that has given us a clear sense of what needs to happen—at the team  
and at the organization level—for Lean UX to succeed. That is the focus of  
Section IV.  
In Chapter 17, Making Organizational Shifts, we’ll dig into the specific organi-  
zational changes that need to be made to support this way of working. It’s not  
just software developers and designers who need to find a way to work  
together. Your whole product development engine is going to need to change if  
you want to create a truly Agile organization.  
In Chapter 18, Lean UX in an Agency, we’ll discuss the issues that are unique  
to implementing Lean UX in an agency context. Having lived this challenge  
ourselves, and worked to train any number of design and product-development  
firms, we’ve come to understand some of the challenges here. We’ll share some  
of the key things you’ll need to consider to make Lean UX successful in this  
kind of business.  
PART IV\: LEAN UX IN YOUR ORGANIZATION  
185 C H A P T E R 1 7  
# Making Organizational Shifts  
In baseball, you don’t know nothing.  
Yogi Berra  
In Part I of this book, we discussed the principles behind Lean UX. We hope  
you understand from that section that Lean UX is a mindset. In Part II, we dis-  
cussed some of the key methods of Lean UX, because Lean UX is also a pro-  
cess. As we’ve worked with clients and taught these methods to teams, it’s  
become clear that Lean UX is also an operational and management method.  
For this reason, you’ll need to make some changes in your organization to get  
the most benefit from working this way.  
Organizational shifts aren’t easy, but they’re not optional. The world has  
changed\: our organizations must change with it. Any business of scale \(or any  
business that seeks to scale\) is, like it or not, in the software business. Regard-  
less of the industry in which your company operates, software has become cen-  
tral to delivering your product or service.  
This is both empowering and threatening. The ability to reach global markets,  
scale operations to meet increased demand, and create a continuous conversa-  
tion with your customers has never been easier. This power is also a double-  
edged sword\: it offers these same opportunities to smaller competitors who  
would never have been able to compete before the broad adoption of software.  
This makes the need to adopt Lean UX all the more urgent.  
Many organizations have come to this conclusion and, in response, have  
sought to scale their product development teams. As they’ve done so, many  
have used the core rhythms of Agile software development techniques to oper-  
ationalize software product development. Unfortunately, many of these  
187 approaches are agile in name only. They fail to adopt the key values of Agile,  
which include collaboration, transparency, and continuous learning. These  
operational approaches maximize delivery velocity but force software teams—  
including the designers on these teams—into production mode. As a result,  
much of the value of design gets lost.  
Lean UX is a way to break out of design-as-production and realize the full  
value of design on cross-functional teams. It makes it possible for you to use  
the power of software to create a continuous improvement loop that allows  
your company to stay ahead of its competitors. It’s this loop that drives real  
organizational agility and allows your company to react to changes in the mar-  
ket at speeds never before possible.  
DesignOps and Lean UX  
As large organizations have embraced design in the operational context of product  
development teams, we’ve seen the rise of a movement called DesignOps. DesignOps  
has as its goal simply the operationalizing of design at scale. It’s a way of thinking  
about and managing the operations of design inside large organizations. This means  
that the DesignOps team in your organization must become key players in any effort to  
adopt Lean UX.  
One important callout here\: DesignOps can be a force for embracing new ways of  
working, but it can also be a force for embracing legacy ways of working. Many of the  
traditional ways of working that the design community has developed are wonderful,  
full of wisdom, and need to be honored. But some ways of working are very specific to  
the design work we did with older technologies and older business models. BDUF \(Big  
Design Up Front\) and deliverable-based work are just two examples of traditional time-  
honored design methods that no longer serve the best interests of designers who are  
seeking maximum impact on Agile teams. As you work to forge a DesignOps-led move-  
ment in your organization, beware of “designers have always done it this way” solu-  
tions, which do not embrace the true spirit of Agile and Lean UX.  
# The Shifts  
When we train teams, they sometimes ask, “How can we put these methods  
into practice here?” And on this point, we’re always a little hesitant. Although  
we’re confident that most organizations can solve these problems, we’re also  
aware that every organization is different. Finding the right solution requires a  
lot of close work and collaboration with your colleagues and your executives.  
To prepare you for that work, we’re going to use this chapter to share some of  
the shifts that organizations need to make in order to embrace Lean UX. We’re  
not going to tell you how to make those shifts; that’s your job. But we hope  
188  
LEAN UX this discussion will help you survey the landscape to find the areas you’re going  
to want to address.  
Changing Culture  
As you implement Lean UX, consider these dimensions of culture\:  
• Be humble.  
• Embrace new skills.  
• Create open, collaborative workspaces.  
• No heroes.  
• Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.  
• Evolve agency culture.  
• Be realistic about your environment.  
Shifting Team Organization  
To implement Lean UX, you’ll also need to rethink the way you organize  
teams\:  
• Think competencies over roles.  
• Create cross-functional teams.  
• Create small teams.  
• Work with distributed teams.  
• Build flexibility into third-party vendor relationships.  
Shifting Process  
Finally, your product development processes will change as well\:  
• Plan work using outcomes, not output.  
• Beware of BDUF sneaking into Agile environments.  
• Embrace speed first, aesthetics second,  
• Tackle UX debt.  
• Rethink documentation practices.  
• Manage up and out.  
CHAPTER 17\: MAKING ORGANIZATIONAL SHIFTS  
189 Shift\: Be humble  
Imagine for a moment that you work on an assembly line that makes cars. The  
end state of your product is well-defined in advance. The cost of producing  
that product is clear. The process to create it has been optimized, and the ways  
customers will use that car—based on more than one hundred years of obser-  
vation—is also clear. In situations like this, the focus is on quality, efficiency,  
and cost control.  
We’re not building cars.  
Our medium is software, and our products and services are complex and  
unpredictable. They don’t have an end state. We can continue to design, build,  
operate, and optimize our digital products as long as it makes economic sense  
to do so. Most perplexing is that our customers might use our digital services  
in ways we never imagined. In many cases, the best features of a system emerge  
over time as people use the system. \(Twitter’s hashtag is a great example of  
this\: users invented this feature, and then Twitter added support for it after the  
fact.\) With so many unknowns, there is only so much confidence we can have  
in the scope, road map, implementation, and success of our product. The good  
news is that through the rise of the Agile and DevOps movements, we can  
move away from the assembly-line methods of past generations and adopt con-  
tinuous production methods. When we pair that capability with Lean UX, we  
get the ability to learn very quickly how valid or invalid our ideas are.  
To fully take advantage of these new capabilities, your organization must  
embrace humility. Your organization must accept that, in the face of all this  
complexity and uncertainty, we just can’t predict the exact shape our service  
will have to take to be successful. This is not an abdication of vision.  
Instead, it requires a strong opinion about the shape the system should take,  
coupled with the willingness to change course if evidence from the market  
reveals that initial vision was wrong. Adopting this mindset makes it safe for  
teams to experiment, fail, and learn. It is only through this trial-and-error pro-  
cess that Lean UX can thrive. If the organization doesn’t make room for course  
correction, the continuous learning that Lean UX promotes will be seen, at  
best, as a distraction and, at worst, as a waste of time.  
Shift\: Embrace new skills  
Many companies turn to designers for the most tactical and traditional capa-  
bilities\: wireframing, specification, UI design, etc. They limit their participation  
in a project to the “design phase” of whatever process the company happens to  
be using. Plugging designers into these existing workflows limits their effective-  
ness by limiting the scope of their work, which has a side effect of reinforcing a  
siloed team model.  
190  
LEAN UX The success of a collaborative team demands more. Although teams still need  
core UX skills, designers must add facilitation as one of their core competen-  
cies. This requires two significant shifts to the way we’ve worked to date\:  
Designers must open up the design process  
The team—not the individual—needs to own the product design. Instead  
of hiding behind a monitor for days at a time, designers need to bring their  
teams into the design process, seek their input, and build that insight into  
the design. Doing so will begin to break down silos and promote a more  
cross-functional conversation to take place. To do this, designers must  
employ a broad range of collaborative tactics and must be both creative  
and deeply practical—seeking tactics that meet the team’s needs, advance  
the conversation, and respect the realities of team capacity and project  
timeline.  
Designers must take a leadership role on their team  
Your colleagues are used to giving you critique on your design work. What  
they’re not used to doing is cocreating that design with you. Design leader-  
ship and facilitation in group brainstorming activities like Design Studio  
can create safe forums for the entire team to conceptualize your product  
and showcase the synthesizing capabilities of the design team.  
Shift\: Create open, collaborative workspaces  
Break down the physical barriers that prevent collaboration. Colocate your  
teams and create workspaces for them that keep everyone visible and accessi-  
ble. Make space for your team to put their work up on walls and other work  
surfaces. Nothing is more effective than walking over to a colleague, showing  
some work, discussing, sketching, exchanging ideas, understanding facial  
expressions and body language, and reaching a resolution on a thorny topic.  
When you colocate people, create cross-functional groupings. That means  
removing them from the comforts of their discipline’s “hideout.” It’s amazing  
how even one cubicle wall can hinder conversation between colleagues.  
Open workspaces make it possible for team members to see each other and to  
easily reach out when questions arise. Some teams have gone as far as putting  
their desks on wheels so that they can relocate closer to the team members  
they’re collaborating with on that particular day. Augment these open spaces  
with breakout rooms where the teams can brainstorm. Wall-sized whiteboards  
or simply painting the walls with whiteboard paint provides many square feet  
of discussion space. In short, remove the physical obstacles between your team  
members. Your space planners might not like it at first, but your stakeholders  
will thank you.  
CHAPTER 17\: MAKING ORGANIZATIONAL SHIFTS  
191 As distributed teams and “hybrid” work situations become more common,  
remember to carry over these qualities to these situations as well. Ensure that  
collaboration and sharing are easy and that your teams have the tools that  
make them most successful rather than the ones IT has chosen for them.  
Shift\: No heroes  
As we’ve continued to work with a wider variety of teams, there are still many  
designers who resist Lean UX. One reason? Many designers want to be heroes.  
In an environment in which designers create beautiful deliverables, they can  
maintain a heroic aura. Requirements go in one end of the design machine,  
and gorgeous artwork makes its way out. People “ooh” and “aah” when the  
design is unveiled. Designers have thrived on these reactions \(both informal  
and formalized as awards\) for many years.  
We’re not suggesting that all of these designs are superficial. Schooling, formal  
training, experience, and a healthy dose of inspiration go into every photoshop  
document that designers create—and often the results are smart, well consid-  
ered, and valuable. However, those glossy deliverables can drive bad corporate  
decisions—they can bias judgment specifically because their beauty is so per-  
suasive. Awards can be based on the aesthetics of the designs \(rather than the  
outcome the design creates\). Hiring decisions are made on the sharpness of  
wireframes, and compensation can depend on the brand names attached to  
each of the portfolio pieces.  
The result of this is that the creators of these documents are heralded as  
thought leaders and elevated to the top of the experience design field. They are  
recognized as the “go-to” people when the problem has to get solved quickly.  
But can a single design hero be responsible for the success of the user experi-  
ence, the business, and the team? Should one person be heralded as the sole  
reason for an initiative’s success?  
In short, no.  
For Lean UX to succeed in your organization, all types of contributors—  
designers and nondesigners—need to collaborate broadly. This can be a hard  
shift for some, especially for visual designers with a background in interactive  
agencies. In those contexts, the creative director is untouchable. In Lean UX,  
the only thing that’s untouchable is customer insight.  
Lean UX literally has no time for heroes. The entire concept of design as  
hypothesis immediately dethrones notions of heroism; as a designer, you must  
expect that many of your ideas will fail in testing. Heroes don’t admit failure.  
But Lean UX designers embrace it as part of the process.  
192  
LEAN UX Shift\: Fall in love with the problem, not the solution  
Lean UX makes us ask hard questions about the nature of quality in our  
design work.  
If you’re a designer reading this, you’ve probably asked yourself a question  
that often comes up when speed trumps aesthetic perfection\:  
If my job is now to put out concepts and ideas instead of finished work,  
everything I produce will feel half-assed. I feel like I’m “going for the  
bronze.” Nothing I produce will ever be finished. Nothing is indicative of  
the kind of products I am capable of designing. How can I feel pride and  
ownership for designs that are simply not done?  
For some designers, Lean UX threatens what they value in their work and puts  
their portfolio at risk. It might even feel as though it threatens their future  
employability. These emotions are based on what many hiring managers have  
valued to date—sexy deliverables \(i.e., solutions\). Rough sketches, “version  
one” of a project, and other low-fidelity artifacts are not the making of a  
“killer portfolio.” With the realization that software solutions continue to  
evolve over time, all of that is now changing.  
Although your organization must continue to value aesthetics, polish, and  
attention to detail, other dimensions of design are equally important. The abil-  
ity to understand the context of a business problem, think fast, and build  
shared understanding needs to get a promotion. Designers can demonstrate  
their problem-solving skills by illustrating the paths they took to get from idea  
to validated learning to experience. In doing so, they’ll demonstrate their deep  
worth as designers. Organizations that seek out and reward problem-solvers  
will attract—and be attracted to—these designers.  
Shift\: Evolve agency culture  
Applying Lean UX in a digital agency is no small challenge. Most agencies  
have a business model that conflicts with Lean UX. The traditional agency  
business model is simple\: clients pay for deliverables—designs, specs, code,  
PowerPoint decks—not outcomes. But agency culture is also a huge obstacle.  
The culture of hero design is strong in places that elevate individuals to posi-  
tions like executive creative director. Cross-disciplinary collaboration can also  
be difficult in big agencies, where the need to keep utilization high has led to  
processes that encourage functional silos. These, in turn, lead to “project pha-  
ses” that encourage deliverable-centric work.  
Perhaps the most challenging obstacle is the client’s expectation to “throw it  
over the wall” to the agency and then see the results when they’re ready.  
Collaboration between client and agency in these situations can be limited to  
CHAPTER 17\: MAKING ORGANIZATIONAL SHIFTS  
193 uninformed and unproductive critique that is based on personal bias, politics,  
and ass-covering.  
To make Lean UX work in an agency, everyone involved in an engagement  
must focus on maximizing two factors\: increasing collaboration between client  
and agency, and working to change the focus from outputs to outcomes.  
Some agencies are attempting to focus on outcomes by experimenting with a  
move away from fixed-scope and deliverable-based contracts. Instead, their  
engagements are based on simple time-and-materials agreements or, more radi-  
cally, on outcome-based contracts. In either case, teams become freer to spend  
their time iterating toward a goal. Clients give up the illusion of control that a  
deliverables-based contract offers but gain a freedom to pursue meaningful and  
high-quality solutions that are defined in terms of outcomes, not feature lists.  
To increase collaboration, agencies can try to break down the walls that sepa-  
rate them from their clients. Clients can be pulled into the process earlier and  
more frequently. Check-ins can be constructed around less formal milestones.  
And collaborative work sessions can be arranged so that both agency and cli-  
ent benefit from the additional insight, feedback, and collaboration with each  
other.  
These are not easy transformations—either for the agency or the client who  
hires them—but it is the model under which the best products are built.  
A quick note about development partners. In agency relationships, software  
development teams \(either at the agency, at the client, or working as a third  
party\) are often treated as outsiders and often brought in at the end of a design  
phase. It’s imperative that you change this\: development partners must partici-  
pate through the life of the project—and not simply as passive observers.  
Instead, you should seek to have software development begin as early as possi-  
ble. Again, you are looking to create a deep and meaningful collaboration with  
the entire project team—and to do that, you must actually be working side by  
side with the developers.  
Shift\: Be realistic about your environment  
Change is scary. The Lean UX approach brings with it a lot of change. This  
can be especially disconcerting for managers who have been in their positions  
for a while and are comfortable in their current roles. Some managers can be  
threatened by proposals to work in a new way—which could end up having  
negative consequences for you. In these situations, try asking for forgiveness  
rather than permission. Try out some ideas and prove their value with quantifi-  
able success. Whether you saved time and money on the project or put out a  
more successful update than ever before, these achievements can help make  
your case. If your manager still doesn’t see the value in working this way and

LEAN UX you believe your organization is progressing down a path of continued “blind  
design,” perhaps it’s time to consider alternative employment.  
Shift\: Think competencies over roles  
In most companies, the work you do is determined by your job title. That job  
title comes with a job description. Too often, people in organizations discour-  
age others from working outside the confines of their job descriptions \(e.g.,  
“You’re not a developer, what can you possibly know about JavaScript?”\).  
This approach is deeply anticollaborative and leaves people’s full set of skills,  
talents, and competencies unused.  
Discouraging cross-functional input encourages organizational silos. The more  
discrete a person’s job is, the easier it becomes to retreat to the safe confines of  
that discipline. As a result, conversation across disciplines wanes, and mistrust,  
finger-pointing, and CYA \(“cover your ass”\) behavior grows.  
Silos are the death of collaborative teams.  
For Lean UX to succeed, your organization needs to adopt a mantra of “com-  
petencies over roles.” Every team member possesses a core competency—  
design, software development, research, and so on—and must deliver on that  
skill set. However, members might also possess secondary competencies that  
make the team work more efficiently.  
Allow your colleagues to contribute to any disciplines in which they have  
expertise and interest. You’ll find it creates a more engaged team that can com-  
plete tasks more efficiently. You’ll also find it builds camaraderie across job  
titles as people with different disciplines show interest in what their colleagues  
are doing. Teams that enjoy working together produce better work.  
Shift\: Create cross-functional teams  
For many teams, collaboration is a single-discipline activity. Developers solve  
problems with other developers while designers go sit on bean bags, fire up the  
lava lamps, and “ideate” with their black-turtlenecked brethren. \(We kid.\)  
\(Well...only a little. We love designers.\)  
The ideas born of single-discipline collaborations are single faceted. They don’t  
reflect the broader perspective of the team, which can illuminate a wider range  
of needs, opportunities, risks, and solutions. Worse, working this way requires  
discipline-based teams to explain their work. Too often, the result is a heavy  
reliance on detailed documentation and a slowdown in the broader team’s  
learning pace.  
Lean UX requires cross-functional collaboration. By creating interaction  
among product managers, developers, QA engineers, designers, and marketers,  
you put everyone on the same page. Equally important\: you put everyone on  
CHAPTER 17\: MAKING ORGANIZATIONAL SHIFTS  
195 the same level. No single discipline dictates to the other. All are working  
toward a common goal. Allow your designers to attend “developer meetings”  
and vice versa. In fact, just have team meetings.  
We’ve known how important cross-functional collaboration is for a long time.  
Robert Dailey’s study from the late ’70s called “The Role of Team and Task  
Characteristics in R&D Team Collaborative Problem Solving and Productiv-  
ity” found a link between a team’s problem-solving productivity and what he  
called “four predictors,” which included “task certainty, task interdependence,  
team size, and team cohesiveness.”1  
Keep your team cohesive by breaking down the discipline-based boundaries.  
Shift\: Create small teams  
Larger groups of people are less efficient than smaller ones. This makes intu-  
itive sense. But less obvious is this\: a smaller team must work on smaller prob-  
lems. This small size makes it easier to maintain the discipline needed to pro-  
duce minimum viable products \(MVPs\). Break your big teams into what Ama-  
zon founder Jeff Bezos famously called “two-pizza teams.” If the team needs  
more than two pizzas to make a meal, it’s too big.  
If the task is large, break it down into related pieces of work that several small  
teams can handle simultaneously. Align those teams with a single outcome to  
achieve. This way, all of them are working toward the same goal. This forces  
these small teams to self-organize and communicate efficiently while reducing  
the risk of each team optimizing locally.  
Shift\: Work with distributed teams  
As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us, colocation is not always an option.  
When setting up distributed teams, give them the tools they need to communi-  
cate and collaborate. These include things like videoconferencing software  
\(e.g., Zoom\), real-time communication services \(e.g., Slack\), online whiteboard  
tools \(e.g., Mural and Miro\), simple file-sharing software \(e.g., Dropbox, Goo-  
gle Docs\), remote-pairing software \(e.g., Screenhero\), and anything else that  
might make their collaboration easier and more productive.  
When it’s possible to travel, don’t forget that occasionally plane tickets to meet  
each other in the flesh go a long way toward maintaining long-distance collab-  
oration. Perhaps the most important thing to remember if you’re trying to  
implement Lean UX with distributed teams is this\: the members of these teams  
1 Robert C. Daley, “The Role of Team and Task Characteristics in R&D Team Collaborative  
Problem Solving and Productivity,” Management Science 24, no. 15 \(November 1, 1978\)\: 1557–  
1676, https\://oreil.ly/hnN7a.  
196  
LEAN UX must be awake at the same time. The overlap doesn’t need to cover an entire  
workday, but there must be some block of time every day during which collea-  
gues can have conversations and participate in collaborative exercises.  
Shift\: Build flexibility into third-party vendor relationships  
Third-party software development vendors pose a big challenge to Lean UX  
methods. If a portion of your work is outsourced to a third-party vendor—  
regardless of the location of the vendor—the Lean UX process is more likely to  
break down. This is because the contractual relationship with these vendors  
can make the flexibility that Lean UX requires difficult to achieve.  
When working with third-party vendors, try to create projects based on time  
and materials. This will make it possible for you to create a flexible relation-  
ship with your development partner. You will need this in order to respond to  
the changes that are part of the Lean UX process. Remember, you are building  
software to learn, and that learning will cause your plans to change. Plan for  
that change and structure your vendor relationships around it.  
When selecting partners, remember that many outsourced development shops  
are oriented toward production work and see rework as a problem rather than  
a learning opportunity. When seeking partners for Lean UX work, look for  
teams willing to embrace experimentation and iteration and who clearly under-  
stand the difference between prototyping-to-learn and developing-for-  
production.  
Shift\: Plan work using outcomes, not output  
Chapter 3 discusses the role of outcomes in Lean UX. Lean UX teams measure  
their success not in terms of completed features but in terms of progress  
toward specific outcomes. Determining outcomes is a leadership activity; it’s  
one that many organizations are not good at or don’t do at all. Too often,  
leadership directs the product team through a feature-centric product road  
map—a set of outputs and features that they require the product team to pro-  
duce by a specific date.  
Teams using Lean UX must be empowered to decide for themselves which fea-  
tures will create the outcomes their organizations require. To do this, teams  
must shift their conversation with leadership from one based on features to  
one centered on outcomes. This conversational shift is a radical one. Product  
managers must determine which business metrics require the most attention.  
What effect are they trying to create? Are they trying to influence customer  
behavior? If so, how? Are they trying to increase performance? If so, by what  
measure? These metrics must be linked to a larger business impact.  
CHAPTER 17\: MAKING ORGANIZATIONAL SHIFTS  
197 Leadership must set this direction. If not, teams must demand this shift of  
them. Teams must ask, “Why are we working on this project?” and “How will  
we know we’ve done a good job?” Managers need to be retrained to give their  
teams the answers to these questions. They must be given the freedom to work  
with their teams to determine which features best achieve these goals. Teams  
must move from feature road maps to backlogs of hypotheses to test. Work  
should be prioritized based on risk, feasibility, and potential success.  
Shift\: Beware of BDUF sneaking into Agile environments  
In the Agile community, you sometimes hear people talk about Big Design Up  
Front or BDUF. We’ve been advocating moving away from BDUF for years.  
But it wasn’t always that way.  
In the early 2000s, Jeff was a UI designer at AOL, working on a new browser.  
The team was working on coming up with ways to innovate on existing  
browser feature sets. But they always had to wait to implement anything until  
Jeff created the appropriate mock-ups, specifications, and flow diagrams that  
described these new ideas.  
One developer got tired of waiting and started implementing some of these  
ideas before the documents were complete. Jeff was furious! How could he  
have gone ahead without design direction? How could he possibly know what  
to build? What if it was wrong or didn’t work? He’d have to rewrite all the  
code!  
Turns out, the work he did allowed the team to see some of these ideas much  
sooner than before. It gave team members a glimpse into the actual product  
experience and allowed them to quickly iterate their designs to be more usable  
and feasible. From that moment on, they relaxed the BDUF requirements,  
especially as the team pushed into features that required animations and new  
UI patterns.  
The irony of the team’s document dependency and the “inspiration” it trig-  
gered in that one developer was not lost. In fact, at the end of the project, Jeff  
was given a mock award \(Figure 17-1\) for inspiring “undocumented creativ-  
ity” in a teammate.  
Even though most Agile teams these days say that they shun the concept of  
BDUF, we’ve seen a resurgence in this practice in supposedly Agile environ-  
ments. This new, sneaky version of BDUF is sometimes called Agilefall. \(Or  
Agile-Scrum-Fall, Water-Scrum-Fall, or Wagile. You get the idea.\) Agilefall is  
the combination of an up-front design phase that results in work that is  
handed off, waterfall style, to an engineering team to then break up into stories  
and develop in an “agile” way. The argument for this way of working centers  
on the engineering team’s desire to stay the course during implementation and  
198  
LEAN UX to be able to predict when the work will ship with some degree of confidence.  
This is done in the name of predictability and efficiency.  
Figure 17-1. Jeff’s “award” for inspiring undocumented creativity in engineers  
The problem, of course, is that Agilefall removes the collaboration between  
design and engineering that Lean UX requires to succeed. It ends up forcing  
teams to create big documentation to communicate design, followed by even  
lengthier negotiations between designers and developers. Sound familiar? It’s  
BDUF in a new disguise. The waste created with Agilefall is a symptom of a  
broader management issue that continues to push teams toward fixed scope  
and fixed deadlines. Engineers rightly feel the only way they can make scope  
and deadline commitments is if they have a crystal-clear understanding of what  
needs to be developed, along with a promise that nothing will change. \(Never  
mind that Agile is about embracing change!\) Of course, as we know by now,  
software is complex and unpredictable, and, even with a locked-down design,  
the ability to predict exactly what will ship and when it will ship is closer to  
fortune-telling than it is to project management.  
If Agilefall is the way your team works, consider amplifying the conversation  
about managing to outcomes with your stakeholders. By moving the conversa-  
tion away from fixed time and scope and steering toward customer behavior as  
a measure of success, the demands to do all the design work up front should  
begin to disappear.  
CHAPTER 17\: MAKING ORGANIZATIONAL SHIFTS  
199 Shift\: Embrace speed first, aesthetics second  
Jason Fried, CEO of Basecamp, once said, “Speed first, aesthetics second.”  
He wasn’t talking about compromising quality. He was talking about editing  
his ideas and process down to the core. In Lean UX, working quickly means  
generating many artifacts. Don’t waste time debating which type of artifact to  
create, and don’t waste time polishing them to perfection. Instead, ask yourself  
the following\:  
• Who do I need to communicate with?  
• What do I need to get across to them immediately?  
• What’s the least amount of work I need to do to communicate that to  
them?  
If you’re working with a developer who is sitting next to you, a whiteboard  
sketch might suffice. If an executive is asking detailed product questions, you  
might need to create a visual mock-up. Customers might require prototypes.  
Whatever the scenario, create the artifact that will take the least amount of  
time. Remember, these artifacts are a transient part of the project—like a con-  
versation. Get it done. Get it out there. Discuss. Move on.  
Aesthetics—in the visual design sense—are an essential part of a finished prod-  
uct and experience. The fit and finish of these elements make a critical contri-  
bution to brand, emotional experience, and professionalism. At the visual  
design refinement stage of the process, putting the effort to obsess over this  
layer of presentation makes a lot of sense. However, putting in this level of pol-  
ish and effort into the early-stage artifacts—wireframes, site maps, workflow  
diagrams—is \(usually\) a waste of time.  
By sacrificing the perfection of intermediate design artifacts, your team will get  
to market faster and learn more quickly which elements of the whole experi-  
ence \(design, workflow, copy, content, performance, value propositions, etc.\)  
are working for the users and which aren’t. And you’ll be more willing to  
change and rework your ideas if you’ve put less effort into presenting them.  
Shift\: Tackle UX debt  
It’s often the case that teams working in Agile processes do not actually go  
back to improve the UI of the software. But, as our friend Jeff Patton likes to  
say, “It’s not iteration if you do it only once.” Teams need to make a commit-  
ment to continuous improvement, and that means not simply refactoring code  
and addressing technical debt but also reworking and improving UIs. Teams  
need to embrace the concept of UX debt and make a commitment to continu-  
ous improvement of the user experience.  
200  
LEAN UX James O’Brien, an interaction designer working in London, describes what  
happened when his team began tracking UX debt in the same manner that the  
team used to track technical debt. “The effect was dramatic. Once we presen-  
ted rework as debt, all opposition fell away. Not only was there no question of  
the debt not being paid down, but it was consistently prioritized.”2  
To begin tracking UX debt, you can just create a category of stories in your  
backlog called UX debt. Sometimes, though, experience problems are not  
something that a single team can solve—solving bigger problems can require  
the coordinated effort of many teams. For these larger efforts—experience  
problems that span large user journeys—try this\:  
• Create a customer journey map of the current experience.  
• Work together with your team to create a second journey map that shows  
the ideal experience.  
• Make these two artifacts clearly visible \(on a wall\) next to each other.  
• Identify teams responsible for portions of that customer journey and invite  
them to the wall to review the gap between current and desired states.  
• Work with these teams to write UX debt stories to go on their backlogs.  
• Clearly identify on the journey maps when the current experience has been  
improved and who is working on other improvements.  
Shift\: Rethink documentation practices  
Depending on the domain you work in, your organization might impose strict  
documentation standards that meet both internal and regulatory compliance.  
These documents might not add much or any value for the project while it’s in  
flight, yet the team still has to create them. Many teams struggle to move their  
projects forward when faced with these regulations. They wait until the docu-  
ments are complete before beginning the design and implementation of the  
work, slowing down progress and team learning. Then, when the documents  
are complete, any adjustment of the work described within them is discour-  
aged because of the documentation overhead that change will drive.  
This situation is exactly where, as designer and coach Lane Goldstone put it,  
you “lead with conversation, and trail with documentation.” The basic philos-  
ophies and concepts of Lean UX can be executed within these environments—  
conversation, collaborative problem-solving, sketching, experimentation, and  
so on—during the early parts of the project life cycle. As hypotheses are pro-  
ven and design directions solidify, transition from informal documentation  
2 James O’Brien, interview with Joshua Seiden and Jeff Gothelf, 2012.  
CHAPTER 17\: MAKING ORGANIZATIONAL SHIFTS  
201 practices back to the documentation standard your company requires. Use this  
documentation for the exact reason your company demands\: to capture deci-  
sion history and inform future teams working on this product. Don’t let it hold  
you up from making the right product decisions.  
Shift\: Manage up and out  
Lean UX gives teams a lot of freedom to pursue effective solutions. It does this  
by stepping away from a feature road map approach and instead empowers  
teams to discover the features they think will best serve the business. But aban-  
doning the feature road map has a cost\: it removes a key tool that the business  
uses to coordinate the activity of teams. So with the freedom to pursue your  
agenda comes a responsibility to communicate that agenda.  
You must constantly reach out to members of your organization who are not  
currently involved in your work to make them aware of what’s coming down  
the pike. This communication will also make you aware of what others are  
planning and help you to coordinate. Customer service managers, marketers,  
parallel business units, and sales teams all benefit from knowing what the  
product organization is up to. By reaching out to them proactively, you allow  
them to do their jobs better. In turn, they will be far less resistant to the change  
your product designs are making.  
Here are two valuable lessons to ensure smoother validation cycles\:  
• There are always other departments that are affected by your work. Ignore  
them at your peril.  
• Ensure customers are aware of any significant upcoming changes and pro-  
vide them the option to opt out \(at least temporarily\).

# Lean UX in an Agency  
Much of the focus of this book has been explicitly about making Lean UX  
work inside a product company or within a product group inside a larger busi-  
ness or organization. While the majority of that advice can be applied in any  
setting, it’s worth calling out explicitly the differences needed to make Lean  
UX work at an agency.  
For the sake of this discussion, when we say “agency,” we mean any organiza-  
tion that sells services to a client. This could be a small four-person design stu-  
dio in Portland, Oregon, or a thousand-person marketing agency in London.  
What makes Lean UX uniquely challenging in this environment is, in a word,  
clients. It’s difficult for agencies to bring new ways of working to clients that  
find these ways of working foreign to their culture. Now, in some cases, this  
will be the exact reason your agency was hired. In others, it will be a foreign  
approach continuously threatened by corporate antibodies resistant to differ-  
ent ways of working. Either way, it will be difficult.  
In this chapter, we’ll cover five key elements to consider as you attempt to  
bring modern ways of working to your company.  
# What Business Do You Want to Be In?  
Agencies are almost always in the deliverables business. They get paid to  
deliver a design, a prototype, some research, or a working piece of software.  
This business model conflicts with Lean UX and its focus on outcomes.  
The traditional agency business model is simple\: clients pay for deliverables—  
designs, specs, code, PowerPoint decks—not outcomes. The other part of an  
agency’s business model is utilization\: you need to keep your people billing.  
203 The need to keep utilization high can lead to processes that encourage func-  
tional silos. These, in turn, lead to “project phases” that encourage deliverable-  
centric work. Selling cross-functional teams is great as long as everyone on the  
team is billable at all times.  
If you’re going to transition your agency’s ways of working to Lean UX, you  
have to consider both of these challenges. First and foremost, you can no  
longer exclusively be in the deliverables business. Will you deliver wireframes,  
prototypes, research, and working software? Of course you will. But these can-  
not be the measures of your success. They cannot be the criteria that determine  
whether or not you get paid. Instead, consider transforming the business into a  
time-and-materials model. You are not selling “an app” or “a design,” but  
instead you are collaborating with your client to find a solution to a customer  
and business problem the client is having. What is that solution? The truthful  
answer is, you don’t know. Instead, you’re going to work together with the cli-  
ent to discover what that solution should be. Lean UX is the perfect process  
for this discovery and continuous delivery of a solution for your clients.  
In order to ensure utilization stays high, sell small teams for finite periods of  
time with clear renewal clauses. At the agency we ran for four years together,  
we would propose a four-person team made up of a product manager, a  
designer, and two developers as an initial team for nearly every project. That  
team had a fixed cost per week, and we would normally sell a three-month  
engagement renewable in three-month blocks. This helped us reinforce the  
mantra of short cycles because the client had an out or a renewal option every  
quarter. It reduced our risk as well by giving us the option to fire a client who  
ended up being a bad fit for the way we wanted to work. Also, having a fixed  
rate for “the team” rather than each individual on that team allowed us to  
adjust the staffing on that team as the project warranted without having to go  
to the client for approval.  
Determining your business model in advance of an all-in shift to a Lean UX  
style of working is important because it will also affect your current staff as  
well as prospective hires. The only asset an agency has is its people. Designers,  
product managers, software developers, etc., come to work for you because  
you promise a certain way of working for specific types of clients. If you  
promise a Lean UX way of working and end up signing clients who won’t  
work this way, your staff will eventually walk away.  
# Selling Lean UX to Clients Is All About Setting  
# Expectations  
Your clients have been hiring agencies for years. Many clients expect to “throw  
it over the wall” to the agency and then see the results when they’re ready. Col-  
laboration between client and agency in this case can be limited to uninformed  
204  
LEAN UX and unproductive critique that is based on personal bias, politics, and ass-  
covering. Given the highly collaborative nature of Lean UX, this is obviously  
not an acceptable relationship. What can you do to get around this?  
Every touchpoint you have with existing and prospective clients is an opportu-  
nity to set expectations about how working with you is different. It starts with  
your brand, your marketing, your positioning, and, most tangibly, your web-  
site. Design and write it in such a way that there can be no doubt that you  
work in a way that sets you apart from traditional agencies. Compound those  
expectations with a consistent output of content on blogs, in publications, and  
on social media. Ensure people know your agency as “the Lean UX folks.” The  
first time you speak with your client in person, go over how you work with  
them. If you get lucky enough to pitch them, your ways of working should be  
clear and up front in the pitch deck.  
If you progress into planning engagements, be clear about how you’ll work  
together and why that’s so critical to building a customer-centered way of  
working. If questions come up from the client that indicate they haven’t fully  
digested that your agency isn’t going to be an outsourcing partner for them,  
pause the process and go over your process again. It’s so critical to get this  
across early and often, because once the contract is signed, any radical shift of  
expectations could come across poorly to your client.  
# Nobody Wants to Buy Experiments  
As you set expectations about what it will be like to work with you, remember  
this important statement\: nobody wants to buy experiments. Your clients want  
apps. They want software. They want design. What they definitely don’t want  
to buy from you is an experiment. Experiments are risky and tend to fail.  
They’re certainly not the market-grade production software that will help your  
client increase market share or their profitability. At least that’s how they see  
it.  
When we first launched our agency, we led with the idea of experiments in our  
sales process. A client would say, “I have \$100,000 for you to build a mobile  
app for my business.” And we’d respond, “Great! We’re going to take \$10,000  
of that and run experiments to figure out exactly how to spend the other  
\$90,000.” Without fail, each client who got this pitch would say, “No. Just use  
the whole budget to build the app. I know my business and my customers. We  
don’t need to experiment.”  
This was a clear sign that we hadn’t properly differentiated ourselves in the  
market, hadn’t set the right expectations with prospects, and were leading with  
a tactic rather than desired end result.  
CHAPTER 18\: LEAN UX IN AN AGENCY  
205 Experiments are a part of Lean UX, but they’re just a tactic. They’re part of a  
process that’s designed to create learning, good decision making, and positive  
outcomes. Leading our sales pitch with the outcome \(e.g., “Our process  
ensures we make the best decisions to help solve your mobile commerce chal-  
lenge”\) proved to be a far more successful way of working.  
# You Made the Sale! Now Navigate Procurement  
Sometimes you’ll do all the right things. Your website will tell your story. Your  
sales pitch will resonate. The client will nod their head. We have ourselves a  
deal! You pat yourself on the back and start dealing with closing the contract,  
only to hear that phrase that all service providers dread\: “OK, let me get our  
procurement folks on to this.”  
If you’ve ever had to deal with the in-house \(or, worse, third-party\) procure-  
ment department of a large organization, then you know how this feels. All the  
convincing you did with the client doesn’t mean anything to the folks who  
have to approve the contract and the purchase. Without fail, the conversation  
flips back instantly to “OK, so we’re giving you \$100,000. What are the spe-  
cific deliverables we will get in return? And on what date?”  
This is another part of the expectation-setting that needs to happen with cli-  
ents ahead of time. As you start to close the contract, the goal is to move away  
from fixed-scope and deliverable-based contracts. Instead, create contracts for  
engagements that are based on simple time-and-materials agreements or, more  
radically, toward outcome-based contracts. Outcome-based contracts, or  
value-based pricing contracts, are rare. They list payment as variable based on  
how much of the outcome the agency can generate. This is often too much risk  
for a client \(and agencies\) to take on without an upper limit to the contract.  
Whether you choose time-and-materials or outcomes-based contracts, the  
agency team will become freer to spend its time iterating toward a specific  
goal. Clients give up the illusion of certainty that a deliverables-based contract  
offers but gain a freedom to pursue meaningful and high-quality solutions that  
are defined in terms of outcomes, not feature lists, and that stand a better  
chance of making their customers more successful.  
# You’re Not an Outsourcing Partner Anymore  
Building a Lean UX process with your clients means that you are not their out-  
sourcing agency anymore. You are their collaboration partner, working toward  
solving a business problem. Your role is not to augment the client’s staff or  
take on a share of work that they cannot pursue in-house. Your role is to make  
the client an active partner of your team. Your client needs to understand this  
too. They will come to stand-ups. They will be involved in decision making on  
206  
LEAN UX a regular basis. They will take part in product discovery efforts. In our agency,  
we made very few of the product backlog prioritization decisions. This was the  
client’s explicit responsibility. The only way they could do this effectively was  
to be present at daily stand-ups, participate with the team in their learning  
activities, and be present at status updates and decision-making meetings. We  
took it further and insisted that the client set up shop in our studio for the  
duration of the engagement. Why? To remove them from daily distractions,  
put them in a more creative space, and remind them that we’re working  
together as a team.  
These relationship expectations need to be in your contract. Your client must  
commit to this high level of engagement if Lean UX is going to work. Remem-  
ber that your goal is to build shared understanding. If the client isn’t present  
for the discovery work, the synthesis, and the decision making, then you have  
to start documenting everything for them, sending it over for approvals, and  
waiting for that feedback before moving forward. This would bring us back to  
the traditional agency style of working.  
We once had a financial services client agree to all of our terms for working  
together. They signed the contract and promptly set up shop in our office. They  
brought in their Windows machines \(hey, we were a Mac shop\) and from the  
get-go attempted to re-create their culture inside our studio. They created every  
obstacle possible to keep us from meeting with their customers. They limited  
our access to deployment servers and essentially kept us from being able to do  
the work we’d agreed to in the contract. Eight weeks in, we raised our hands  
to pause the process. We met with the client and raised concerns that the ways  
of working we had agreed to were being met with stiff resistance. The client  
told us there was nothing they could do about it. We wrapped things up neatly  
in the next two weeks and fired that client. It wasn’t that we couldn’t continue  
working in the ways they wanted. It was just that if we did, we risked losing  
our team due to the client’s behavior. That was unacceptable to us.  
# A Quick Note About Development Partners and  
# Third-Party Vendors  
In agency relationships, software development teams \(either at the agency, at  
the client, or working as a third party\) are often treated as outsiders and often  
brought in at the end of a design phase. It’s imperative that you change this\:  
development partners must participate through the life of the project—and not  
simply as passive observers. Instead, you should seek to have software develop-  
ment begin as early as possible. Again, you are looking to create a deep and  
meaningful collaboration with the entire project team—and to do that, you  
must actually be working side by side with the developers.  
CHAPTER 18\: LEAN UX IN AN AGENCY  
207 Third-party software development vendors pose a big challenge to Lean UX  
methods. If a portion of your work is outsourced to a third-party vendor—  
regardless of the location of the vendor—the Lean UX process is more likely to  
break down. This is because the contractual relationship with these vendors  
can make the flexibility that Lean UX requires difficult to achieve.  
When working with third-party vendors, try to create projects based on time  
and materials. This will make it possible for you to create a flexible relation-  
ship with your development partner. You will need this in order to respond to  
the changes that are part of the Lean UX process. Remember, you are building  
software to learn, and that learning will cause your plans to change. Plan for  
that change and structure your vendor relationships around it.  
When selecting partners, remember that many outsourced development shops  
are oriented toward production work and see rework as a problem rather than  
a learning opportunity. When seeking partners for Lean UX work, look for  
teams willing to embrace experimentation and iteration and who clearly under-  
stand the difference between prototyping-to-learn and developing-for-  
production.  
# Wrapping Up  
Working as a service provider creates different challenges for implementing  
Lean UX. Remember that this is as much of a cultural shift for your agency as  
it is a business model shift. It will change not only how you sell but how and  
who you hire. It’s imperative to set expectations with your clients that your  
ways of working will challenge their notion of working with an agency. A little  
creativity and a dash of trust can make the contract and procurement process  
more successful. Finally, a bad client is a bad client regardless of how you’re  
working together. Ensuring the integrity of your team is your topmost priority.

LEAN UX C H A P T E R 1 9  
# A Last Word  
After the first edition of Lean UX was released, we were pleased to start get-  
ting feedback from readers. After all, Lean UX is all about listening to your  
users—so we wanted to understand what the “users” of the book had to say.  
Readers had lots to say \(thank you!\), but one theme emerged from all the oth-  
ers and has stayed persistent over the years. This theme has to do with the  
need to grow organizations and processes that can really embrace this way of  
working.  
We know that working with Lean UX requires changes. What we didn’t under-  
stand clearly until we heard from readers is that the changes fall into two cate-  
gories\: changes readers could make for themselves, and changes that required  
leaders to get involved—leaders who might not want to change, for whatever  
reasons.  
Our readers told us\: Look, we can make certain kinds of changes ourselves,  
but for other changes, we need to rely on shifting our leader’s attitudes. We  
need to change things beyond ourselves—we need to change the way our orga-  
nization itself works.  
Now, changing an organization, even a small one, is a big challenge. It’s a chal-  
lenge that most designers and product people have little training or experience  
trying to enact. Even people seasoned in the field of organizational develop-  
ment know that changing organizations is hard. So it can feel overwhelming.  
And that’s what we heard from our readers. They wanted to know how to  
change, and they didn’t know where to start. They wanted help.  
Kind of a bummer, huh?  
209 Well listen\: the point of this chapter is not to make you feel hopeless. We firmly  
believe that people, teams, and companies can change. What’s more, we  
believe that you can use Lean UX to help you make these changes! In addition  
to helping teams learn Lean UX, we’ve spent the years since the first edition  
came out working on these kinds of transformation problems, and we’ve seen  
firsthand that change is possible.  
Now, the whys and hows and wheres of organizational transformation are  
beyond the scope of this book, but we want to offer you a starting point.  
# The Product that Makes the Product  
In the words of our friend Barry O’Reilly, a product development organization  
is “the product that makes the product.” In other words, you can approach  
organizational development using many of the same tools you use for product  
development. And we firmly believe that you can use the methods of Lean UX  
in the service of organizational development.  
What change do you want to make in your organization? Can you describe the  
change in terms of the outcome you seek? Maybe you want to make research  
more collaborative. Your outcome might be\: on future research projects,  
ensure every team member participates in at least one direct customer inter-  
view session. Or maybe you want to change the way work is assigned to your  
team. Your outcome might be\: in the next quarter, half of the epics we work on  
will be defined by a user outcome rather than a feature list.  
Guess what\: you’re using Lean UX! Now, how are you going to make these  
changes? Well, you’re going to want to try a number of experiments until you  
find the right way to achieve your outcome. Think of these experiments as  
minimum viable process.  
So, while you may not have authority to completely change the way your orga-  
nization works, there’s nothing that’s stopping you from enlisting a small  
group of willing collaborators and using the tools of Lean UX to start creating  
the organization that you want. You will have to start designing new things  
\(like work processes\) for new people \(stakeholders, peers, collaborators\), but  
you can do that, right? Yes, you can do that.  
We’ve been so pleased to see so many teams adopting these methods over the  
years, and we’re positive that you can do it too. And, as always, we’re excited  
to hear from you. Good luck on your Lean UX journey, and let us know how  
it’s going!  
As we said at the start of this book\: please keep in touch and share your  
thoughts. Reach out to us at jeff@jeffgothelf.com and josh@joshuaseiden.com.  
We always look forward to hearing from you.
