HOW TO MEASURE AND DRAW 
A PROPERTY FLOOR PLAN
Property floor plans are essential tools 
for real estate and building professionals. 
They provide a visual representation 
of a property’s layout, helping buyers, 
sellers, architects, and contractors make 
informed decisions. This step-by-step 
guide will walk you through the process 
of accurately measuring and drawing 
property floor plans.
MATERIALS AND TOOLS:
Measuring tape (25-50 feet) 
Laser measuring device (optional, 
for precise measurements) 
Graph paper or grid paper 
Pencils and erasers 
Straightedge ruler 
Architectural scale 
Clipboard or sketchbook 
Camera (optional, for reference)

STEP 1: 
MAKE A ROUGH SKETCH   
STEP 2: 
START WITH THE EXTERIOR 
DIMENSIONS 
STEP 3: 
MEASURE INTERIOR WALLS   After familiarizing yourself with the 
property’s layout and identifying key 
features, start making a rough sketch of 
the exterior walls on your graph paper, 
including any exterior windows and doors. 
Then, sketch in your interior walls and 
doors. Don’t worry if you have to make 
several changes to this sketch to get it right! 
Measure the overall dimensions of the 
property’s exterior. Begin at one corner of 
the building and use the measuring tape or 
laser device to measure the length of each 
exterior wall. Record the measurements 
on your sketch. For multi-story properties 
or split-level interior areas, use a separate 
piece of paper for each level, ensuring that 
you indicate where the stairs are and label 
each floor. 
Inside the property, measure the interior 
walls. Start from one corner of the property 
and work your way around the entire space. 
Measure each wall’s length and record 
these measurements on your sketch. 
Be sure to account for any alcoves, closets, 
or irregular shapes.  Tip: When drawing a floor plan for 
an apartment or condo, refer to the 
emergency evacuation/fire escape plan 
located in the building. This will give you 
a guideline of the main exterior walls of 
the apartment and sometimes they also 
display the internal walls as well.

STEP 7: 
CONVERT THE ROUGH SKETCH 
INTO THE FLOOR PLAN  STEP 5: 
ADD DETAILS
Include additional details such as counters, 
electrical outlets, light switches, heating vents, 
and plumbing fixtures. You can also choose to 
add any furniture to your floor plan if desired.
STEP 6: 
USE AN ARCHITECTURAL 
SCALE
To ensure accuracy, use an architectural scale 
to convert the measurements into a scaled 
drawing. Common scales include 1/4” = 1 foot 
or 1/8” = 1 foot. Consistently apply the chosen 
scale throughout your floor plan. 
Using a straightedge ruler (short rulers are often 
easier to use), draw the floor plan on your graph 
paper, adhering to the scale you’ve chosen. 
Start with the exterior walls and then add interior 
walls, doors, windows, and room dimensions. 
Make sure your drawing is as neat as possible. Tip: Did you know we offer a dynamic 
variety of professional floor plans 
starting from just US$24?

STEP 4: 
INCLUDE DOORS AND 
WINDOWS     
Measure and record the dimensions of all doors 
and windows on your floor plan. Indicate the 
location and size of each opening. For doors, 
make sure you indicate which way the doors 
open and refer to the symbols sheet provided in 
this guide to help you draw them.

STEP 9: 
LABEL AND FINALIZE
STEP 10: 
SUBMIT FOR A REDRAWLabel each room and mark any important 
notes on your floor plan. Include a North 
arrow to indicate orientation if applicable. 
Many smartphones have a compass app 
- use it to determine the North direction. 
Ensure all elements are clearly labelled 
and easy to understand and don’t forget 
to write down the address on the plan to 
avoid any confusion later. 
Now it’s time to turn your drawing into a 
professional floor plan. We offer a range 
of floor plan styles, including 2D, 3D, and 
branded floor plans. To turn your drawing 
into a professional floor plan, submit a 
picture of it along with your preferences 
for the final plan’s appearance. Feel free 
to include as many notes as needed to 
explain your drawing to our team. BEFORE

STEP 8: 
REVIEW AND VERIFY   
Walk around the property to ensure you 
haven’t missed anything, then double-
check your measurements and drawings 
for accuracy. Compare your floor plan 
to the rough sketch, and any reference 
materials or photographs you’ve taken. Tip: Did you know you can customize 
floor plans with your branding? Contact 
our Customer Service team and ask 
about our Branded Floor Plan Template.
