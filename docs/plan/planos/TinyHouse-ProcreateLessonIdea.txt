What is a tiny home?1.
Research
Tiny homes are houses that are generally 
less than 400 square feet and designed 
to have a low impact on the environment. 
Spend some time researching different 
examples of the design of tiny homes.
Use the following questions to guide  
your research:
Why do some people choose to live in  
tiny homes?
What does it mean to have a  
'carbon footprint'?
What are some examples of small spaces  
that have multiple uses?1.

Brainstorm2.
What do you need?
Make a list of the things that you need to 
include in your home. This will include the 
bare necessities, as well as a few of your 
favourite belongings that you simply can't 
live without.
CONSIDER...
What size bed will you sleep on?
How will you stay warm?
Of all your personal belongings, what are the 
5 things that have the most meaning to you?

Blueprint3.
Visualize your home
On a new canvas, set the background to 
blue and use a white brush to experiment 
with a few different designs for your home.
CONSIDER:
Think about how you would like to move 
through the space and how you can fit in all 
the belongings you brainstormed. 
Is there anything that you'll need to sacrifice 
to keep the house under 400 square feet?3.

Measure it up4.
Size of furniture
Use the Measure  app to measure the size 
of the furniture in your current house. This 
will help you work out how much room to 
allow for furniture in your design.
Tap the Measure  app to open it.
Move your iPad around so that the central 
dot is over the starting point of your 
measurement. Tap the Add (+)  button.
Move your device so the centre dot is over the 
end point of your measurement. Again, tap 
the Add (+)  button.
Once you've measured your object, make 
note of its dimensions.4.

Set a scale
Decide upon a scale for your drawing. 
What does one square on your grid 
represent as a real distance?
Write this on your canvas somewhere  
as a reminder.
A bird's eye view
Now draw your furniture and belongings to 
scale in top view, using the measurements 
you took earlier as a guide.
Tap the + in the Layers Panel  to create a 
new layer for each item. 
REMEMBER
Make sure to name your layers as you go. This will 
make moving your furniture around much easier.6.

Put in place
Once you've drawn all of your items, use 
the Transform  tool to rearrange them into 
position, based on your earlier blueprint.
Walls and windows
As you try out your belongings in different 
places, draw in your walls and windows  
around them on a new layer.
REMEMBER...
Walls take up room too. Find a door frame in your 
house and use the Measurement  app again to see 
how thick the walls in your house or school are.7.

What makes a  
house a home?
Add a new layer and then add color 
and texture to your floor plan, including 
personal touches such as flooring styles 
and fun rugs.
CONSIDER
What are the things about your own home  
that make your space feel comfortable  
and familiar?8.

How much room do 
you have?
Now your design is complete, calculate  
the area of your tiny home.
How does this compare to the place you 
currently live in?
What do you think you would enjoy about 
living in a smaller space with less posessions?
What do you think you would find 
challenging?9.

Adding elevations
Now that you have more room on  
your canvas, you can add some  
elevation drawings.
Elevations are two-dimensional designs 
that show a room or building in a flattened 
side-view.
Use your floor plan as a guide to help  
draw each of your elevations. 11.
